#
# ftype (integer >=0) specifies frequency thresholding (value reduction).
# ftype=1 gives binary features (default),
# ftype=2 gives ternary features (values 0, 1 or 2),
# ftype=k gives features with values upto k (values>k reduced to k),
# ftype=0 means all frequencies used as given (no reduction).
#
ftype=1
#
# ttype (integer 1 or 2) specifies types of tests in rules.
# ttype=1 for only positive tests f>=n, where n>=1 (default),
# ttype=2 for allowing all kinds of tests.
#
ttype=1
#
# boost-recall (integer>=0) allows precision/recall tradeoff.
# boost-recall=0 gives equal weight to precision and recall (default)
# boost-recall>=1 increasingly favors recall over precision.
#
boost-recall=0
#
# se (real >=0) specifies how to define the "best" ruleset.
# se=f, "best" is the smallest within f std errors of min test-error ruleset.
# se=0, the "best" ruleset is the min test-error ruleset.
#
se=1
#
# short-rules=1 if quick short rules should be obtained.
# short-rules=0 if normal rules should be obtained (default).
#
short-rules=0
#
# maxrul (integer >1) specifies the maximum number of rules generated.
#
maxrul=5000
#
# optimization-threshold (real >=0) is for optimizing pruned rulesets.
# higher values imply less frequent optimization and
# the program will run faster, but may produce weaker results.
# specifying -1 computes the default value (ncases/200).
#
optimization-threshold=-1
