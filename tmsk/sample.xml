Bulawayo, Republic of Zimbabwe.


MY PLEASURE,

This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your
unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction requiring
maximum confidence. Though this approach appears desperate,I can assure
you that whatever questions you would need to ask or any other thing you
will need to know regarding this proposal, will be adequately answered
to give you a clearer understanding of it so as to arrive at a
successful conclusion.

My name is Mr Ngobe Ngayaka Chief Credit Officer (CCO), Standard
Chartered Bank Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. On December 6, 1999, a Foreign
consultant/contractor with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, Mr.Thierry
COSBAN, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,
valued at Fifteen Million,UnitedStates Dollars in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, that Mr.
Cosban died from an automobile accident .On further investigation, I
found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace
his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation
and discovered that Mr. Cosban did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in our Bank.

From past experiences, I know that no one will ever come forward to
claim the deceased funds. According to ZIMBABWEAN Law, at the expiration
of 5 (five) years, the funds will be Unclaimable and revert to the
ownership of the ZIMBABWE Government as contribution to the Defence
ministry if nobody applies to claim the fund. In order to avert this
development, I in conjunction with a colleague (the Chief Operating
Officer in the bank) now seek your permission to allow an attorney do a
backdated WILL in your name, so that the funds would be released to you
as the new owner (on behalf of me and my colleague). We are writing you
because, citizens resident here we cannot operate a foreign account or
have an account that is more than Zw$500,000.Consequently, I will
present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim it on
our behalf with the help of an attorney.

This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your: FULL
NAME/FULL CONTACT ADDRESS/PHONE/FAX NUMBERS , so that an Attorney will
prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the
beneficiary of the funds. The money will then be released to your
custody by the bank,for us to share in the ratio of 70% for us and 30%
for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interestd, please
reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and further explanation that will help you
understand the transaction.

No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive, please i imploy you
to observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for both of us. Note also that we shall require
your assistance to invest our share in your country.

Buying of properties like houses, hotels etc) This is why your urgent
action and response is of priority to enable us conclude this
transaction, as soon as possible. Awaiting your urgent replyYou can also
send me a mail via my email :nngaya@uymail.com



Thanks and regards.
Mr. Ngobe Ngayaka.
Chief Credit Officer (CCO)
Standard Chartered Bank

That year, she completed her run to San Francisco wearing a T-shirt that
read, "I Love Epileptics." Her dad ran every mile at her side, and her mom,
a nurse, followed in a motor home behind them in case anything went wrong.
And why do we do that? That is the real question. Perhaps some of us just
get so caught up in the fact that a man is merely talking to begin with. And
even more so the fact that they are talking to us. How many of us walk
around life starving from lack of conversation, stimulating conversation,
with a man?

your recommendation was excellent. i got the knoppix cd from will and we
got my laptop installed with linux in less than an hour (and he didn't have to
do much besides tell me to choose ext3 instead of reiserfs and show me how to
edit a sources.list file so that updates are grabbed from the local mirrors). 
with lilo, i can now boot into xp or linux 2.4 or linux 2.6. there are a few 
niggling things that i don't understand how to do (i'll get to them later!!). 
but atleast i got the basic stuff up and running...

thanks for the tip. my debian experience is far better than what i had with 
redhat or mandrake. all i needed was a single cd (knoppix) instead of the 3-4 
cd's required for the other distros.

A sales rep, an administration clerk and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out in a puff of smoke.
The Genie says, "I usually only grant three wishes, so I'll give each of you just one."
"Me first! Me first!" says the admin clerk "I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world."
Poof! She's gone.
In astonishment, "Me next! Me next!" says the sales rep. "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas and the love of my life."
Poof! She's gone.
"OK, your wish," the Genie says to the manager.
The manager says, "I want those two back in the office after lunch."
