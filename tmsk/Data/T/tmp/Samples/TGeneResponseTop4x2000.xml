      <str>The histological comparative study was performed on chordoma and notochordal cell rests (NCRs).</str>
      <str>To understand the histological similarity and homology of chordoma and NCRs, further supplying direct evidence of chordoma origin from NCRs.</str>
      <str>Although many studies supported the hypothesis that chordoma arise from NCRs, there has been little direct evidence reported to date. Of the base of our previous study, we conducted a comparative histological study among NCRs coexisting in chordoma, fetal NCRs, and chordoma tumor components.</str>
      <str>Thirty fetal nucleus pulposus and 46 chordoma specimens were harvested, and classic chordoma tumor markers and brachyury expression levels were investigated through immunohistochemical method.</str>
      <str>The fetal NCRs existed in the form of clusters in the center of nucleus pulposus &lt;36 gestational weeks; NCRs coexisting in chordoma specimens consisted of packed cells without extracellular myxoid matrix. Both the above-mentioned NCRs as well as chordoma tumor components showed high sensitivity for classic chordoma tumor makers (epithelial membrane antigen, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, vimentin, S-100); both kinds of NCRs showed completely negative expression for brachyury, whereas chordoma tumor components demonstrated 100% positivity.</str>

      <str>Increasing numbers of studies support the hypothesis that chordoma arises from notochordal cell rests, although the mechanism awaits further research. Brachyury is the first specific molecule linking chordoma with the notochord, and galectin-3 has been widely used as a marker of notochordal cells. We conducted a histological study of the expression of these two molecules in 46 classic chordoma specimens and unexpectedly found that classic chordoma tumor cells coexisted with benign notochordal cell rests in six specimens. Brachyury and galectin-3 expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. All specimens contained atypical chordoma tumor cells set within an abundant myxoid matrix, which strongly expressed brachyury and galectin-3. However, brachyury and galectin-3 were not expressed in the notochordal cells. Benign notochordal cells, present as notochord rests, could undergo malignant transformation to form chordoma; however, the cause and role of brachyury and galectin-3 expression in chordoma tumorigenesis requires further careful study.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a marker for notochord-derived tissues and neoplasms, such as chordoma. However, the prognostic relevance of brachyury expression in chordoma is still unknown. The improvement of tissue microarray technology has provided the opportunity to perform analyses of tumor tissues on a large scale in a uniform and consistent manner. This study was designed with the use of tissue microarray to determine the expression of brachyury. Brachyury expression in chordoma tissues from 78 chordoma patients was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray. The clinicopathologic parameters, including gender, age, location of tumor and metastatic status were evaluated. Fifty-nine of 78 (75.64%) tumors showed nuclear staining for brachyury, and among them, 29 tumors (49.15%) showed 1+ (&lt;30% positive cells) staining, 15 tumors (25.42%) had 2+ (31% to 60% positive cells) staining, and 15 tumors (25.42%) demonstrated 3+ (61% to 100% positive cells) staining. Brachyury nuclear staining was detected more frequently in sacral chordomas than in chordomas of the mobile spine. However, there was no significant relationship between brachyury expression and other clinical variables. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, brachyury expression failed to produce any significant relationship with the overall survival rate. In conclusion, brachyury expression is not a prognostic indicator in chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a malignant bone neoplasm hypothesized to arise from notochordal remnants along the length of the neuraxis. Recent genomic investigation of chordomas has identified T (Brachyury) gene duplication as a major susceptibility mutation in familial chordomas. Brachyury plays a vital role during embryonic development of the notochord and has recently been shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived cancers. However, current understanding of the role of this transcription factor in chordoma is limited due to the lack of availability of a fully characterized chordoma cell line expressing Brachyury. Thus, the objective of this study was to establish the first fully characterized primary chordoma cell line expressing gain of the T gene locus that readily recapitulates the original parental tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo.</str>
      <str>Using an intraoperatively obtained tumor sample from a 61-year-old woman with primary sacral chordoma, a chordoma cell line (JHC7, or Johns Hopkins Chordoma Line 7) was established. Molecular characterization of the primary tumor and cell line was conducted using standard immunostaining and Western blotting. Chromosomal aberrations and genomic amplification of the T gene in this cell line were determined. Using this cell line, a xenograft model was established and the histopathological analysis of the tumor was performed. Silencing of Brachyury and changes in gene expression were assessed.</str>
      <str>The authors report, for the first time, the successful establishment of a chordoma cell line (JHC7) from a patient with pathologically confirmed sacral chordoma. This cell line readily forms tumors in immunodeficient mice that recapitulate the parental tumor phenotype with conserved histological features consistent with the parental tumor. Furthermore, it is demonstrated for the first time that silencing of Brachyury using short hairpin RNA renders the morphology of chordoma cells to a more differentiated-like state and leads to complete growth arrest and senescence with an inability to be passaged serially in vitro.</str>
      <str>This report represents the first xenograft model of a sacral chordoma line described in the literature and the first cell line established with stable Brachyury expression. The authors propose that Brachyury is an attractive therapeutic target in chordoma and that JHC7 will serve as a clinically relevant model for the study of this disease.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a transcription factor which is required for posterior mesoderm formation and differentiation as well as for notochord development during embryogenesis. Due to its expression in the neoplastic cells of chordoma, a malignant tumour deriving from notochordal remnants, but not in tumors showing a similar histology, brachyury has been proposed as a diagnostic marker of this neoplasia. Though commonly considered a hallmark of chordoma, the expression of brachyury has been also documented in the stromal cells of hemangioblastoma (HBL), a slow growing tumor which may involve the central nervous system (CNS) and, rarely, the kidney. Herein we review the role of brachyury immunohistochemical detection in the identification and differential diagnosis of chordoma and HBL towards histological mimickers and suggest that brachyury is added to the panel of immunohistochemical markers for the recognition of HBL in routinary practice, principally in unusual sites. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumour of bone, the molecular marker of which is the expression of the transcription factor, brachyury. Having recently demonstrated that silencing brachyury induces growth arrest in a chordoma cell line, we now seek to identify its downstream target genes. Here we use an integrated functional genomics approach involving shRNA-mediated brachyury knockdown, gene expression microarray, ChIP-seq experiments, and bioinformatics analysis to achieve this goal. We confirm that the T-box binding motif of human brachyury is identical to that found in mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish development, and that brachyury acts primarily as an activator of transcription. Using human chordoma samples for validation purposes, we show that brachyury binds 99 direct targets and indirectly influences the expression of 64 other genes, thereby acting as a master regulator of an elaborate oncogenic transcriptional network encompassing diverse signalling pathways including components of the cell cycle, and extracellular matrix components. Given the wide repertoire of its active binding and the relative specific localization of brachyury to the tumour cells, we propose that an RNA interference-based gene therapy approach is a plausible therapeutic avenue worthy of investigation.</str>

      <str>A small number of tumors bearing histological resemblance to axial chordoma arising from the bone or soft tissue outside the axial skeleton have been reported. These lesions have historically been referred to as parachordoma, chordoma periphericum (CP), or extra-axial chordoma (EAC). With the introduction of the immunohistochemical stain brachyury, a sensitive and specific marker for notochordal origin, chordomas arising in extra-axial locations (i.e., CP, EAC), are now diagnosed with more accuracy and distinguished from parachordoma, which resembles chordoma on histology. The distinction between EAC and parachordoma is clinically important because EAC confirmed by immunoreactivity for brachyury tends to grow and recur with local bone destruction. Prior to the introduction of brachyury, the diagnosis of EAC was challenging and therefore the imaging features of EAC have not been comprehensively described. We report two cases of recurrent EAC confirmed by the expression of brachyury arising from the distal femur and distal tibia and describe the imaging findings from radiography and MRI at initial diagnosis and at recurrence. </str>

      <str>Brachyury is recognized as a specific marker for notochord-derived tissues and neoplasms, and has become a defining immunohistochemical feature of chordoma. The main differential diagnostic consideration for chordoma is chondrosarcoma, which is known to lack brachyury expression. However, within the spectrum of genitourinary neoplasia, metastatic germ cell tumors and clear cell renal cell carcinoma may also be close morphological mimics of chordoma, particularly given the increasing prevalence of small tissue samples from image-guided biopsies. Although immunoreactivity for brachyury has been reported in a few germ cell tumors, a thorough characterization of staining by specific subtype has not been performed in a large series. Additionally, brachyury expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma has not been well studied. In this study, immunohistochemical expression with the brachyury antibody was evaluated in 111 germ cell tumors, 30 non-neoplastic and neoplastic (non-germ cell) testicular tissues, and 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas using tissue microarray technology. In addition, immunoreactivity for PAX-8 and SALL-4 was evaluated in 12 chordomas on whole section. No nuclear brachyury expression was identified in any of the 101 germ cell tumors within the tissue microarray (including choriocarcinoma (1), embryonal carcinoma (20), intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (2), seminoma (64), spermatocytic seminoma (1), teratoma (5) and yolk sac tumor (8)), in any of the 30 non-neoplastic and neoplastic (non-germ cell) testicular tissues, or in any of the 10 whole-section seminomas. All 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas were also non-reactive for brachyury. All 12 chordomas showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity for brachyury, but no expression of SALL-4. In all, 1 of 12 chordoma cases showed patchy, 1+ nuclear immunoreactivity for PAX-8. This study confirms the specificity of brachyury for chordoma in the differential diagnostic distinction from the potential genitourinary mimics, germ cell tumors and metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</str>

Histologically, 34 cases (66.7%) were classical chordomas, 13 cases (25.5%) had a dominant chondroid component, and 2 cases each (3.9%) were chondroid chordomas and dedifferentiated chordomas, respectively. Brachyury staining was positive in 46 of the 51 chordomas (90.2%) and negative in all 58 nonchordomatous tumors. The dedifferentiated area in 2 chordomas was negative for brachyury staining. Fourteen of 15 chordomas with chondroid component showed positive brachyury staining. Immunohistochemical expression of other markers, included cytokeratin (positive in 23 of 23 cases; 100%), epithelial membrane antigen (positive in 22 of 22 cases; 100%) and S100 protein (positive in 18 of 21 cases; 85.7%).</str>

      <str>Chordomas are invasive tumors that develop from notochordal remnants and frequently occur in the skull base. The T gene and its product (brachyury) have recently been suggested to play an important role in chordoma progression. To date, few studies have investigated the relationship between the molecular/genetic characteristics of chordoma and patient prognosis. We analyzed 37 skull base chordomas for chromosomal copy number aberrations using comparative genomic hybridization, brachyury expression by immunohistochemistry, and T gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results of these molecular analyses and clinical parameters were compared with the patients' clinical courses. Univariate analyses using the log-rank test demonstrated that losses on chromosome 1p and gains on 1q and 2p were negatively correlated with progression-free survival, as were factors such as female sex, partial tumor removal, lack of postoperative irradiation, and high MIB-1 index. Expression of brachyury and copy number gain of the T gene were also significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox hazards model showed that lack of irradiation, gain on chromosome 2p, and expression of brachyury were independently associated with a poor prognosis. Our results suggest that brachyury-negative chordomas arebiologically distinct from brachyury-positive chordomas and that T/brachyury might be an appropriate molecular therapeutic target for chordoma. </str>

      <str>The molecular basis of chordoma is still poorly understood, particularly with respect to differentially expressed genes involved in the primary origin of chordoma. In this study, therefore, we compared the transcriptional expression profile of one sacral chordoma recurrence, two chordoma cell lines (U-CH1 and U-CH2) and one chondrosarcoma cell line (U-CS2) with vertebral disc using a high-density oligonucleotide array. The expression of 65 genes whose mRNA levels differed significantly (p&lt;0.001; ≥6-fold change) between chordoma and control (vertebral disc) was identified. Genes with increased expression in chordoma compared to control and chondrosarcoma were most frequently located on chromosomes 2 (11%), 5 (8%), 1 and 7 (each 6%), whereas interphase cytogenetics of 33 chordomas demonstrated gains of chromosomal material most prevalent on 7q (42%), 12q (21%), 17q (21%), 20q (27%) and 22q (21%). The microarray data were confirmed for selected genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. As in other studies, we showed the expression of brachyury. We demonstrate the expression of new potential candidates for chordoma tumorigenesis, such as CD24, ECRG4, RARRES2, IGFBP2, RAP1, HAI2, RAB38, osteopontin, GalNAc-T3, VAMP8 and others.

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumour of bone showing notochordal differentiation with characteristic expression of the transcription factor brachyury (T). Next to giving insight into its differentiation spectrum, the expression of T can be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool. The expression of brachyury in chordoma is necessary to maintain cell proliferation in chordoma cell lines, indicating that in chordoma it might be a master regulator of oncogenesis. Identification and mapping of the full gene regulatory network in a recent work in The Journal of Pathology by Nelson and colleagues not only shed light on involved pathways but also indicated pathways for targeted therapy, including brachyury itself.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a transcription factor of the T-box family typically expressed in notochord and chordoma. Some studies report brachyury as highly specific for chordoma, whereas others have concluded that brachyury is expressed in many types of common carcinomas by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and could be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic process. In this study, we immunohistochemically evaluated 5229 different tumors for nuclear brachyury expression using a new rabbit monoclonal antibody and automated immunostaining (Leica Bond Max). Only nuclear labeling was scored, and antibody dilution of 1:2000 was used. In normal tissues, only rare cells in seminiferous tubules were labeled; all other organs were negative. All chordomas (75/76), except a sarcomatous one, were positive, whereas chondrosarcomas were negative. Among epithelial tumors, positivity was often detected in embryonal carcinoma (74%) and seminoma (45%). Pulmonary small cell carcinoma was often positive (41%), whereas pulmonary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas only rarely showed nuclear brachyury positivity (3% to 4%). Common carcinomas such as ductal carcinomas of the breast or adenocarcinomas of the prostate only exceptionally showed nuclear positivity (&lt;1%). No colorectal, hepatocellular, renal cell, squamous cell, thyroid or urothelial carcinoma, or mesothelioma showed nuclear brachyury positivity. Among mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors, only isolated cases of melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and follicular lymphoma showed nuclear expression. However, as shown previously with lung carcinoma, experiments with lower antibody dilutions (1:200 to 1:500) showed weak cytoplasmic and nuclear labeling in breast cancers. In addition to chordoma, we show here for the first time that nuclear brachyury expression is prevalent in embryonal carcinoma, seminoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lung but very rare in common carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanoma. With these reservations, we have demonstrated the presence of nuclear brachyury immunoreactivity to be a sensitive and fairly specific marker for chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordoma cells can generate solid-like tumors in xenograft models that express some molecular characteristics of the parent tumor, including positivity for brachyury and cytokeratins. However, there is a dearth of molecular markers that relate to chordoma tumor growth, as well as the cell lines needed to advance treatment. The objective in this study was to isolate a novel primary chordoma cell source and analyze the characteristics of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model for comparison with the established U-CH1 and U-CH2b cell lines.</str>
      <str>Primary cells from a sacral chordoma, called "DVC-4," were cultured alongside U-CH1 and U-CH2b cells for more than 20 passages and characterized for expression of CD24 and brachyury. While brachyury is believed essential for driving tumor formation, CD24 is associated with healthy nucleus pulposus cells. Each cell type was subcutaneously implanted in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ(null) mice. The percentage of solid tumors formed, time to maximum tumor size, and immunostaining scores for CD24 and brachyury (intensity scores of 0-3, heterogeneity scores of 0-1) were reported and evaluated to test differences across groups.</str>
      <str>The DVC-4 cells retained chordoma-like morphology in culture and exhibited CD24 and brachyury expression profiles in vitro that were similar to those for U-CH1 and U-CH2b. Both U-CH1 and DVC-4 cells grew tumors at rates that were faster than those for U-CH2b cells. Gross tumor developed at nearly every site (95%) injected with U-CH1 and at most sites (75%) injected with DVC-4. In contrast, U-CH2b cells produced grossly visible tumors in less than 50% of injected sites. Brachyury staining was similar among tumors derived from all 3 cell types and was intensely positive (scores of 2-3) in a majority of tissue sections. In contrast, differences in the pattern and intensity of staining for CD24 were noted among the 3 types of cell-derived tumors (p &lt; 0.05, chi-square test), with evidence of intense and uniform staining in a majority of U-CH1 tumor sections (score of 3) and more than half of the DVC-4 tumor sections (scores of 2-3). In contrast, a majority of sections from U-CH2b cells stained modestly for CD24 (scores of 1-2) with a predominantly heterogeneous staining pattern.</str>
      <str>This is the first report on xenografts generated from U-CH2b cells in which a low tumorigenicity was discovered despite evidence of chordoma-like characteristics in vitro. For tumors derived from a primary chordoma cell and U-CH1 cell line, similarly intense staining for CD24 was observed, which may correspond to their similar potential to grow tumors. In contrast, U-CH2b tumors stained less intensely for CD24. These results emphasize that many markers, including CD24, may be useful in distinguishing among chordoma cell types and their tumorigenicity in vivo.</str>

      <str>Axial chordoma represents approximately 1% of malignant bone tumors. This tumor expresses cytokeratins, specifically cytokeratin 19, and commonly S100. More recently brachyury, a transcription factor important in mesodermal differentiation, including notochord development, has been detected by immunohistochemistry in axial chordomas and hemangioblastomas but not chondrosarcomas or other neoplasms. In this report, we describe 10 cases (6 men, 4 women: age 18 to 68 y; mean 44.6) of extra-axial tumors, 8 in bone and 2 in soft tissue, with morphologic and immunohistochemical features identical to those of axial chordoma. Imaging excluded metastases from axial chordoma. Three tumors occurred in the tibia, the others in the rib, metatarsal, ulna, femur, pubis: 2 intracortical, 6 intramedullary. Both soft tissue brachyury-positive tumors, one involving the thumb the other the wrist, were sited in the juxta-articular region. Seven of the tumors were widely excised and these patients are disease-free but of the 3 tumors that recurred, 1 was curetted, 1 was marginally excised, and 1 had a pathologic fracture on presentation. Metastases have not occurred in any of the patients. We also confirm the expression of brachyury in hemangioblastomas, and for the first time demonstrates its expression in spermatogonia and testicular germ cell tumors by immunohistochemistry. Brachyury was not detected in a wide range of tumors including carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas. In conclusion, we describe the first series of extra-axial skeletal chordomas bringing the total number of such cases reported in the literature to 11, and present the first report of 2 soft tissue chordomas as defined by brachyury expression.</str>

The weak/positive, positive and strong/positive rates were 5.3% (3/57), 21.1% (12/57) and 64.9% (37/57), respectively. The association between the expression of brachyury and recurrence was not statistically significant. Kaplan‑Meier analysis revealed that the degree of surgery, rather than the expression of brachyury, was associated with tumor recurrence (P=0.001). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of Brachyury offers a sensitive marker, but not a risk factor, for skull base chordomas, and radical surgery is recommended.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are malignant tumours that occur along the spine and are thought to derive from notochordal remnants. There is significant morphological variability between and within chordomas, with some showing prominent areas of chondroid differentiation. Our microarray data from a broad range of connective tissue neoplasms indicate that, at the transcriptional level, chordomas resemble cartilaginous neoplasms. Here we show that chordomas express many genes known to be involved in cartilage development, but they also uniquely express genes distinguishing them from chondroid neoplasms. The brachyury transcription factor, known to be involved in notochordal development, is only expressed by chordomas. Using a polyclonal antibody, we show that brachyury is expressed in the embryonic notochord and in all 53 chordomas analysed, labelling both chondroid and chordoid areas of these tumours. In contrast, the protein was not detected in over 300 neoplasms, including 163 chondroid tumours. Brachyury was not detected in the nucleus pulposus, arguing against the hypothesis that this tissue derives directly from the notochord. These data provide compelling evidence that chordomas derive from notochord and demonstrate that brachyury is a specific marker for the notochord and notochord-derived tumours.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordomas are challenging tumors due to their deep surgical location and resistance to conventional radiotherapy. Chemotherapy plays a marginal role in the treatment of chordoma resulting from lack of preclinical models due to the difficulty in establishing tumor cell lines and valuable in vivo models. Here, we established a cell line from a recurrent clival chordoma. Cells were cultured for more than 30 passages and the expression of the chordoma cell marker brachyury was monitored using both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Sensitivity of chordoma cells to the inhibition of specific signaling pathways was assessed through testing of a commercially available small molecule kinase inhibitor library. In vivo tumorigenicity was evaluated by grafting chordoma cells onto immunocompromised mice and established tumor xenografts were treated with rapamycin. Rapamycin was administered to the donor patient and its efficacy was assessed on follow-up neuroimaging. Chordoma cells maintained brachyury expression at late passages and generated xenografts closely mimicking the histology and phenotype of the parental tumor. Rapamycin was identified as an inhibitor of chordoma cell proliferation. Molecular analyses on tumor cells showed activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and mutation of KRAS gene. Rapamycin was also effective in reducing the growth of chordoma xenografts. On the basis of these results, our patient received rapamycin therapy with about six-fold reduction of the tumor growth rate upon 10-month follow-up neuroimaging. This is the first case of chordoma in whom chemotherapy was tailored on the basis of the sensitivity of patient-derived tumor cells. </str>

      <str>Recent evidence suggests that the expression of brachyury is necessary for chordoma growth. However, the mechanism associated with brachyury-regulated cell growth is poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a regulator of brachyury expression in normal tissue, may also play an important role in chordoma pathophysiology. Using a panel of chordoma cell lines, we explored the role of FGF signaling and brachyury in cell growth and survival. Western blots showed that all chordoma cell lines expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), FGFR3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), whereas no cell lines expressed FGFR1 and FGFR4. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that chordoma cells produced FGF2. Neutralization of FGF2 inhibited MEK/ERK phosphorylation, decreased brachyury expression and induced apoptosis while reducing cell growth. Activation of the FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway by FGF2-initiated phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2)-α (Tyr196) prevented apoptosis while promoting cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immunofluorescence staining showed that FGF2 promoted the translocation of phosphorylated ERK to the nucleus and increased brachyury expression. The selective inhibition of FGFR, MEK and ERK phosphorylation by PD173074, PD0325901 and PD184352, respectively, decreased brachyury expression, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth and EMT. Moreover, knockdown of brachyury by small hairpin RNA reduced FGF2 secretion, inhibited FGFR/MEK/ERK phosphorylation and blocked the effects of FGF2 on cell growth, apoptosis and EMT. Those findings highlight that FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway coordinately regulates chordoma cell growth and survival and may represent a novel chemotherapeutic target for chordoma.</str>

Few studies have been done on this neoplasm because of its rarity. In addition, there is a lack of a good in vitro model on which to perform more characterization.</str>
      <str>We describe a twenty-eight-year-old man with a mass in the right scapula. Cytomorphology and immunohistochemistry, including brachyury staining, were used to formulate the final diagnosis. A fragment of the tumor was placed in culture, and cells obtained were injected subcutaneously in an immunocompromised mouse. From the tumor developed in mice, a cell line has been derived and characterized by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, karyotyping, clonogenicity, and cell and tumor growth curves.</str>
      <str>Cytomorphology on the tumor showed nests of round cells with vacuoles and also physaliferous-like cells with uniform nuclei. Immunochemistry revealed a tumor positive for vimentin, moderately positive for S-100 and cytokeratin AE1/AE3, weakly positive for epithelial membrane antigen, and negative for p63 and cytokeratin (CK)-7. Further analysis revealed the tumor was diffusely and strongly positive for brachyury. The cell line derived from the tumor showed rapid doubling-time, a strong expression of mesenchymal cell surface markers, a karyotype of diploid or hypotetraploid clones with numerous chromosomal aberrations, and the ability to form colonies without attachment and to form tumors in immunocompromised mice.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are midline tumors that arise from embryonic remnants of the notochord and are considered to be malignant tumors because of their tendency to invade and destroy the involved bone. Cases of intradural chordomas without bone involvement have been rarely described with a predilection for prepontine location. The absence of bony invasion renders the complete excision of these tumors more feasible and is related to their better prognosis in comparison to conventional chordomas. Herein we report the first intradural chordoma arising in the Meckel's cave. The intradural location of the lesion, outside midline structures, in the absence of bone infiltration, made the differential diagnosis versus other meningeal lesions such as chordoid meningioma challenging. The intense and strong immunohistochemical expression of pan-cytokeratins, S100, cytokeratin-19 and of the notochordal marker brachyury allowed differential diagnosis toward other tumors showing chordoid morphology. The expression of brachyury, which had not been previously analyzed in intradural chordoma, definitely links the histogenesis of this neoplasia to the notochord, similar to that of conventional chordoma. We also show that, different from conventional chordoma, intradural chordoma does not express the metallo-proteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9, which may account for its indolent biological behavior.</str>

      <str>The distinction between chondrosarcoma and chordoma of the skull base/head and neck is prognostically important; however, both have sufficient morphologic overlap to make delineation difficult. As a result of gene expression studies, additional candidate markers have been proposed to help in separating those entities. We sought to evaluate the performance of new markers: brachyury, SOX-9, and podoplanin alongside the more traditional markers glial fibrillary acid protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CD24, and epithelial membrane antigen. Paraffin blocks from 103 skull base/head and neck chondroid tumors from 70 patients were retrieved (1969-2007). Diagnoses were made based on morphology and/or whole-section immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and S100 protein yielding 79 chordomas (comprising 45 chondroid chordomas and 34 conventional chordomas), and 24 chondrosarcomas. A tissue microarray containing 0.6 mm cores of each tumor in triplicate was constructed using a manual array (MTA-1; Beecher Instruments). For visualization of staining, the ImmPRESS detection system (Vector Laboratories) with 2-diaminobenzidine substrate was used. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each marker. Core loss from the microarray ranged from 25 to 29% yielding 66-78 viable cases per stain. The classic marker, cytokeratin, still has the best performance characteristics. When combined with brachyury, accuracy improves slightly (sensitivity and specificity for detection of chordoma 98 and 100%, respectively). Positivity for both epithelial membrane antigen and AE1/AE3 had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100% for detecting chordoma in this study. SOX-9 is apparently common to both notochordal and cartilaginous differentiation, and is not useful in the chordoma-chondrosarcoma differential diagnosis. Glial fibrillary acid protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CD24, and epithelial membrane antigen did not outperform other markers, and are less useful in the diagnosis of chordoma vs chondrosarcoma. Podoplanin still remains the only positive marker for chondrosarcoma, though its accuracy is less than previously reported.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare primary bone tumors that occur along the neuraxis. Primary treatment is surgery, often followed by radiotherapy. Treatment options for patients with recurrence are limited and, notably, there are no FDA approved therapeutic agents. Development of therapeutic options has been limited by the paucity of preclinical model systems. We have established and previously reported the initial characterization of the first patient-derived chordoma xenograft model. In this study, we further characterize this model and demonstrate that it continues to resemble the original patient tumor histologically and immunohistochemically, maintains nuclear expression of brachyury, and is highly concordant with the original patient tumor by whole genome genotyping. Pathway analysis of this xenograft demonstrates activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In vitro studies demonstrate that two small molecule inhibitors of EGFR, erlotinib and gefitinib, inhibit proliferation of the chordoma cell line U-CH 1. We further demonstrate that erlotinib significantly inhibits chordoma growth in vivo. Evaluation of tumors post-treatment reveals that erlotinib reduces phosphorylation of EGFR. This is the first demonstration of antitumor activity in a patient-derived chordoma xenograft model and these findings support further evaluation of EGFR inhibitors in this disease. </str>

      <str>Somatic alterations in the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 were first described in the malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) of infancy. Since then, SMARCB1 alterations have been found in other tumors, forming a varied group of SMARCB1-deficient tumors, which sometimes shares overlapping immunohistochemical and histological findings. Thus, the diagnosis is challenging. We report two cases of pediatric SMARCB1-deficient tumors from the clivus that illustrate the diagnostic difficulties. Both cases were strongly positive for epithelial markers associated with loss of BAF47 (INI1) expression, and were negative for S100 and CD34. Molecular analyses of the SMARCB1 gene found a deletion of all nine exons in both cases. In the first case, a 5-year-old girl presented with a thoracic metastasis of a clival tumor, which was diagnosed as MRT and treated accordingly. The morphological findings and the expression of brachyury would favor the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated chordoma. The second case was a quickly fatal clival tumor in a 2-year-old boy: This tumor was morphologically undifferentiated and raises the problem of differential diagnosis between an MRT, a malignant myoepithelial tumor, or an undifferentiated chordoma due to the location and the expression of brachyury. Studies of biological signatures, such as transcriptome profiling, could help to understand the apparent overlap between these tumors. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, but often malignant, bone cancer that preferentially affects the axial skeleton and the skull base. These tumors are both sporadic and hereditary and appear to occur more frequently after the fourth decade of life; however, modern technologies have increased the detection of pediatric chordomas. Chordomas originate from remnants of the notochord, the main embryonic axial structure that precedes the backbone, and share with notochord cells both histological features and the expression of characteristic genes. One such gene is Brachyury, which encodes for a sequence-specific transcription factor. Known for decades as a main regulator of notochord formation, Brachyury has recently gained interest as a biomarker and causative agent of chordoma, and therefore as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we review the main characteristics of chordoma, the molecular markers, and the clinical approaches currently available for the early detection and possible treatment of this cancer. In particular, we report on the current knowledge of the role of Brachyury and of its possible mechanisms of action in both notochord formation and chordoma etiogenesis.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumours considered to arise from notochordal remnants that persist in the axial skeleton. Although their morphology can resemble that of a carcinoma, chondrosarcoma or malignant melanoma, the axial location and their well-defined immunophenotype, including expression of cytokeratins (CK7/20/8/18/19) and S100, generally allow the diagnosis to be made with confidence once the possibility is considered. In contrast, making a robust diagnosis of an extra-axial chordoma has been difficult in the absence of specific markers for chordomas. We have recently shown in gene expression microarray and immunohistochemistry studies that brachyury, a transcription factor crucial for notochordal development, is a specific and sensitive maker for chordomas. We now present a case of an intracortical tibial tumour, with detailed report of the imaging, and morphological features consistent with a chordoma, where notochordal differentiation was demonstrated with an antibody to brachyury. The tumour cells were also positive for cytokeratins, including CK19, and S100, CEA, EMA and HMBE1, findings which support the diagnosis of chordoma. Brachyury can be employed as a marker of notochordal differentiation and help identify confidently, for the first time, extra-axial bone and soft tissue chordomas, and tumours which may show focal notochordal differentiation.</str>

The purpose of this study was to characterize Brachyury as a potential target for lung cancer therapy.</str>
      <str>The expression of Brachyury was evaluated by PCR and by immunohistochemistry in human lung tumors and adult normal tissues. Brachyury gene copy number and promoter methylation status were analyzed in tumor tissues with various levels of Brachyury expression.

      <str>Our results showed Brachyury protein expression in 41% of primary lung carcinomas, including 48% of adenocarcinomas and 25% of squamous cell carcinomas.

      <str>Chordomas are locally aggressive bone tumors known to arise from the remnants of the notochord. Because chordomas are rare, molecular studies aimed at developing new therapies are scarce and new approaches are needed. Chordoma cells and cancer stem-like cells share similar characteristics, including self-renewal, differentiation, and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, it seems possible that chordomas might contain a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells. The aim of this study is to determine whether cancer stem-like cells might be present in chordomas.</str>
      <str>In this study, the authors used gene expression analysis for common cancer stem-like cellmarkers, including c-myc, SSEA-1, oct4, klf4, sox2, nanog, and brachyury, and compared chordoma cells and tissues with nucleus pulposus tissues (disc degenerated nontumorigenic tissues). Differentiation through agents such as all-trans retinoic acid and osteogenic differentiation medium was induced to the chordoma cells. Additionally, U-CH1 cells were sorted via magnetic cell sorting for stem cell markers CD133 and CD15. After separation, positive and negative cells for these markers were grown in a nonadherent environment, soft agar, to determine whether the presence of these cancer stem-like cells might be responsible for initiating chordoma. The results were compared with those of untreated cells in terms of migration, proliferation, and gene expression by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.</str>
      <str>The results indicate that chordoma cells might be differentiating and committing into an osteogenic lineage when induced with the osteogenic differentiation agent. Chordoma cells that are induced with retinoic acid showed slower migration and proliferation rates when compared with the untreated cells. Chordoma cells that were found to be enriched by cancer stem-like cell markers, namely CD133 and CD15, were able to live in a nonadherent soft agar medium, demonstrating a self-renewal capability. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that cancer stem-like cell markers were also found to be expressed in chordoma cells and tissues.</str>

      <str>The molecular events in chordoma pathogenesis have not been fully delineated, particularly with respect to copy number changes. Understanding copy number alterations in chordoma may reveal critical disease mechanisms that could be exploited for tumor classification and therapy. We report the copy number analysis of 21 sporadic chordomas using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Recurrent copy changes were further evaluated with immunohistochemistry, methylation specific PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR. Similar to previous findings, large copy number losses, involving chromosomes 1p, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 18, were more common than copy number gains. Loss of CDKN2A with or without loss of CDKN2B on 9p21.3 was observed in 16/20 (80%) unique cases of which six (30%) showed homozygous deletions ranging from 76 kilobases to 4.7 megabases. One copy loss of the 10q23.31 region which encodes PTEN was found in 16/20 (80%) cases. Loss of CDKN2A and PTEN expression in the majority of cases was not attributed to promoter methylation. Our sporadic chordoma cases did not show hotspot point mutations in some common cancer gene targets. Moreover, most of these sporadic tumors are not associated with T (brachyury) duplication or amplification. Deficiency of CDKN2A and PTEN expression, although shared across many other different types of tumors, likely represents a key aspect of chordoma pathogenesis. Sporadic chordomas may rely on mechanisms other than copy number gain if they indeed exploit T/brachyury for proliferation.</str>

Twelve of 181 (7%) tumours displayed amplification of the T locus and an additional two cases showed focal amplification; 70/181 (39%) tumours were polysomic for chromosome 6, and 8/181 (4.5%) primary tumours showed a minor allelic gain of T as assessed by FISH. No germline alteration of the T locus was identified in non-neoplastic tissue from 40 patients. Copy number gain of T was seen in a similar percentage of sacrococcygeal, mobile spine and base of skull tumours. Knockdown of T in the cell line, U-CH1, which showed polysomy of chromosome 6 involving 6q27, resulted in a marked decrease in cell proliferation and morphological features consistent with a senescence-like phenotype. The U-CH1 cell line was validated as representing chordoma by the generation of xenografts, which showed typical chordoma morphology and immunohistochemistry in the NOD/SCID/interleukin 2 receptor [IL2r]gammanull mouse model.

      <str>The embryonic T-box transcription factor brachyury is aberrantly expressed in a range of human tumors. Previous studies have demonstrated that brachyury is a driver of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer progression. Brachyury expression in human tumor cells enhances tumor invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in vivo, and induces resistance to various conventional therapeutics including chemotherapy and radiation. These characteristics, and the selective expression of brachyury for a range of human tumor types vs. normal adult tissues, make brachyury an attractive tumor target. Due to its intracellular localization and the "undruggable" character of transcription factors, available options to target brachyury are currently limited. Here we report on the development and characterization of an immunological platform for the efficient targeting of brachyury-positive tumors consisting of a heat-killed, recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)-brachyury vector-based vaccine (designated as GI-6301) that expresses the full-length human brachyury protein. We demonstrate that human dendritic cells treated with recombinant yeast-brachyury can activate and expand brachyury-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro that, in turn, can effectively lyse human tumor cells expressing the brachyury protein. Vaccination of mice with recombinant yeast-brachyury is also shown here to elicit brachyury-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and to induce anti-tumor immunity in the absence of toxicity. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial of GI-6301 is currently ongoing in patients with advanced tumors; to our knowledge, this is the first vaccine platform aimed at targeting a driver of tumor EMT that has successfully reached the clinical stage. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare primary malignant bone tumor and there exist only a few established human chordoma cell lines. The scarcity of robust chordoma cell lines has limited the ability to study this tumor. In this report, we describe the establishment of a novel chordoma cell line and characterize its in vitro and in vivo behaviors. The tumor tissue was isolated from a patient with recurrent chordoma of the sacrum. After 6 months in culture, the chordoma cell line, referred here as CH22, was established. Microscopic analysis of two-dimensional culture confirmed that the CH22 cells exhibited a typical vacuolated cytoplasm similar to the well-established chordoma cell line U-CH1. Electron microscopy showed cohesive cells with numerous surface filopodia, pockets of glycogen and aggregates of intermediate tonofilaments in cytoplasm. Three-dimensional culture revealed that the CH22 cells could grow and form clusters by day 8. The MTT assays demonstrated that, compared with sensitive osteosarcoma cell lines, CH22 cells were relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the CH22 cells expressed brachyury, vimentin, and cytokeratin. Finally, histological analysis of CH22 xenograft tumor tissues demonstrated the appearance of physaliphorous cells and positive staining of brachyury, cytokeratin, and S100. By CT and MRI, imaging xenografts showed the typical appearances seen in human chordomas. These findings suggest that the established novel human chordoma cell line CH22 and its tumorigenecity in SCID nude mice may serve as an important model for studying chordoma cell biology and the development of new therapeutic modalities.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare and slowly growing malignant bone tumors which mostly occur in adults. These bone tumors are characterized by epithelial and mesenchymal aspects. It is suggested that they arise from remnants of the notochord because they are found along the axial skeleton (e.g. clival, spinal and sacrococcygeal locations). It appears that cytogenetic aberrations are not randomly found in this tumor group. Loss of chromosomal material (e.g. 1p, 3p, 10q, 13q and 14q) is more frequently found than gain of material (e.g. 7q, especially 7q33). Several studies demonstrated brachyury expression (T; 6q27) as a possible candidate gene in the oncogenesis of chordomas (e.g. knock down in the chordoma cell line U-CH1). So far therapy consists of complete resection and irradiation, e.g. with carbon ions. Targeting therapy is not yet established in routine protocols but phase II studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown partial response of tumors and, in some studies stabilization of the disease has been described. </str>

      <str>Chordoma, and its relationship to the notochord, has intrigued many researchers over the last two centuries. In particular, the morphological overlap with cartilaginous tumours is striking, and developmental biology has shown a tight relationship between cartilage and the notochord. This is reflected in the expression of common genes in chordoid and chondroid tumours. Wide gene expression analyses have led to the identification of key molecules that might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chordoma. Brachyury, a key factor in notochord fate, is significantly differentially expressed in chordoma. This not only gives insight into the histogenesis of this tumour but may also point towards new diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis between chordoid and chondroid tumours.</str>

      <str>In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of Brachyury expression in prostate tumorigenesis using a large series of human prostate samples comprising benign tissue, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, localized tumor, and metastatic tissues. The results obtained were compared with what can be inferred from the Oncomine database. In addition, multiple in vitro models of prostate cancer were used to dissect the biologic role of Brachyury in prostate cancer progression.</str>
      <str>We found that Brachyury is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer and metastatic tumors when compared with normal tissues, both at protein and at mRNA levels. Brachyury expression in the cytoplasm correlates with highly aggressive tumors, whereas the presence of Brachyury in the nucleus is correlated with tumor invasion. We found that Brachyury-positive cells present higher viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion rates than Brachyury-negative cells. Microarray analysis further showed that genes co-expressed with Brachyury are clustered in oncogenic-related pathways, namely cell motility, cell-cycle regulation, and cell metabolism.</str>
      <str>Collectively, the present study suggests that Brachyury plays an important role in prostate cancer aggressiveness and points, for the first time, to Brachyury as a significant predictor of poor prostate cancer prognosis. Our work paves the way for future studies assessing Brachyury as a possible prostate cancer therapeutic target.</str>

We conducted an association study of 40 individuals with chordoma and 358 ancestry-matched controls, with replication in an independent cohort.

      <str>Chordomas are rare, low to intermediate grade malignant bone tumors of the axial skeleton. Current treatment options are limited to surgical procedures, as chordomas are largely resistant to conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Cell lines are valuable tools for exploring molecular mechan-isms involved in tumorigenesis and they have a fundamental impact on the development of new anticancer agents. To date, only two chordoma cell lines exist world-wide. In the present study we report a third chordoma cell line, MUG-Chor1, as well as corresponding cultured fibroblasts established from a recur-rent morphologically 'classic' sacrococcygeal chordoma of a 58-year-old Caucasian female. The cells are brachyury-positive and have the characteristics of chordoma. The genetic profile of the primary chordoma and the established chordoma cell line was investigated during the culturing period (early and late passage). MUG-Chor1 is karyotypically, &lt;2n&gt;43-47,XX,del(3)(q1?)[11], +7,del(9)(p1?),der(9;15)(q10;q10),-10,+der(12)t(9;12)(p2?;q1?),der (12)t(12;19)(p;p)t(17;19)(q;q),-15,der(17;21)(q10;q10),der(20)t(10;20) (q25?26?;q11?12?),-21,-22[20]/idemx2[5] and displays known, chordoma-typical genetic changes, such as chromosomal gains at T/brachyury locus (6q27), losses at 9p24.3-p13.1 (includes the CDKN2a/CDKN2b locus), 10p15.3-q23.32 (includes the PTEN locus) and losses of 10q25.2 (includes the PDCD4 locus). MUG-Chor1 bears a marked resemblance to chordomas in vivo and is, therefore, an optimal in vitro chordoma model.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor Brachyury, a molecule frequently detected in human cancers but seldom found in normal adult tissue, has recently been characterized as a driver of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal switch of human carcinomas. In the current investigation, we present data demonstrating that in two different human lung carcinoma models expression of Brachyury strongly correlates with increased in vitro resistance to cytotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation. We also demonstrate that chemotherapy treatment in vitro selects for tumor cells with high levels of Brachyury and that the degree of resistance to therapy correlates with the level of Brachyury expression. In vitro and in vivo, human lung carcinoma cells with higher levels of Brachyury divide at slower rates than those with lower levels of Brachyury, a phenomenon associated with marked downregulation of cyclin D1, phosphorylated Rb and CDKN1A (p21). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Brachyury binds to a half T-box consensus site located within the promoter region of the p21 gene, indicating a potential mechanism for the observed therapeutic resistance associated with Brachyury expression. Finally, we demonstrate that in vivo treatment of tumor xenografts with chemotherapy results in the selective growth of resistant tumors characterized by high levels of Brachyury expression. Altogether, these results suggest that Brachyury expression may attenuate cell cycle progression, enabling tumor cells to become less susceptible to chemotherapy and radiation in human carcinomas. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are slow-growing tumors and most commonly involve the sacrum and clivus. Multiple recurrences are frequent. Childhood chordomas are rare and often show exceptionally aggressive behavior, resulting in short survival and a high incidence of metastatic spread.</str>
      <str>This study examined the histologic features and immunohistochemical profile of pediatric chordomas and compared them with their adult counterparts.</str>
      <str>Nine pediatric and 13 adult cases were included in the study. Childhood chordomas were classified into conventional, atypical, and poorly differentiated types. Immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, S100, brachyury, p53, INI1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and CD117. Cytogenetic analyses were performed in a subset of tumors for SMARCB1/INI1 locus on 22q chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and analysis of the SMARCB1/INI1 gene sequence.</str>
      <str>All tumors showed expression of cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100, vimentin, brachyury, and EGFR. Atypical morphology, p53 expression, higher MIB-1 labelling index (LI), and INI1 loss were more frequently seen in pediatric chordomas as compared with adults. None of the tumors showed CD117 expression. No point mutation in the SMARCB1/INI1 gene was noted in the tumors examined; however, 4 pediatric and 1 adult chordoma showed loss of this locus on FISH analysis.</str>
      <str>A subset of pediatric chordomas with atypical histomorphologic features needs to be identified, as they behave in an aggressive manner and require adjuvant therapy.

      <str>Chordomas are malignant bone tumors arising from notochordal remnants. They most commonly occur at the sacrum, skull base, and spine. The gold standard treatment for these tumors is a combination of en-bloc resection and radiation therapy.</str>

      <str>Chordoma and chondrosarcoma are malignant bone tumors characterized by the abundant production of extracellular matrix. The resistance of these tumors to conventional therapeutic modalities has prompted us to delineate the gene expression profile of these two tumor types, with the expectation to identify potential molecular therapeutic targets. Furthermore the transcriptional profile of chordomas and chrondrosarcomas was compared to a wide variety of sarcomas as well as to that of normal tissues of similar lineage, to determine whether they express unique gene signatures among other tumors of mesenchymal origin, and to identify changes associated with malignant transformation. A HG-U133A Affymetrix Chip platform was used to determine the gene expression signature in 6 chordoma and 14 chondrosarcoma lesions. Validation of selected genes was performed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on an extended subset of tumors. By unsupervised clustering, chordoma and chondrosarcoma tumors grouped together in a genomic cluster distinct from that of other sarcoma types. They shared overexpression of many extracellular matrix genes including aggrecan, type II &amp; X collagen, fibronectin, matrillin 3, high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA), matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9, and MMP-19. In contrast, T Brachyury and CD24 were selectively expressed in chordomas, as were Keratin 8,13,15,18 and 19. Chondrosarcomas are distinguished by high expression of type IX and XI collagen. Because of its potential usefulness as a target for immunotherapy, the expression of HMW-MAA was analyzed by IHC and was detected in 62% of chordomas and 48% of chondrosarcomas, respectively. Furthermore, western blotting analysis showed that HMW-MAA synthesized by chordoma cell lines has a structure similar to that of the antigen synthesized by melanoma cells. In conclusion, chordomas and chondrosarcomas share a similar gene expression profile of up-regulated extracellular matrix genes. HMW-MAA represents a potential useful target to apply immunotherapy to these tumors.</str>

A comparison of survival among breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting who had tumors with high vs low brachyury mRNA expression demonstrated that high expression of brachyury is associated as an independent variable with higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4 to 23.5; P = 5.14×10(-4)) and distant metastasis (HR = 15.2; 95% CI = 3.5 to 66.3; P = 3.01×10(-4)).

      <str>Chordoma, the molecular hallmark of which is T (brachyury), is a rare malignant bone tumour with a high risk of local recurrence and a tumour from which metastatic disease is a common late event. Currently, there is no effective drug therapy for treating chordomas, although there is evidence that some patients respond to the empirical use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonists. The aim of this study was to determine the role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of chordoma. Paraffin-embedded material from 173 chordomas from 160 patients [sacro-coccygeal (n = 94), skull-based (n = 50), and mobile spine (n = 16)] was analysed by immunohistochemistry and revealed total EGFR expression in 69% of cases analysed. Of 147 informative chordomas analysed by FISH, 38% revealed high-level EGFR polysomy, 4% high-level polysomy with focal amplification, 18% low-level polysomy, and 39% disomy. Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array membranes showed EGFR activation in the chordoma cell line U-CH1 and all of the three chordomas analysed. Direct sequencing of EGFR (exons 18-21), KRAS, NRAS, HRAS (exons 2, 3), and BRAF (exons 11, 15) using DNA from 62 chordomas failed to reveal mutations. PTEN expression was absent by immunohistochemistry in 19 of 147 (13%) analysed chordomas, only one of which revealed high-level polysomy of EGFR. The EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin (AG 1478) markedly inhibited proliferation of the chordoma cell line U-CH1 in vitro and diminished EGFR phosphorylation in a dose-dependant manner, a finding supported by inhibition of phosphorylated Erk1/2. p-Akt was suppressed to a much lesser degree in these experiments. There was no reduction of T as assessed by western blotting. These data implicate aberrant EGFR signalling in the pathogenesis of chordoma. This study provides a strategy for patient stratification for treatment with EGFR antagonists.</str>

      <str>Metastatic disease is responsible for the majority of human cancer deaths. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of metastasis is a major step in designing effective cancer therapeutics. Here we show that the T-box transcription factor Brachyury induces in tumor cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important step in the progression of primary tumors toward metastasis. Overexpression of Brachyury in human carcinoma cells induced changes characteristic of EMT, including upregulation of mesenchymal markers, downregulation of epithelial markers, and an increase in cell migration and invasion. Brachyury overexpression also repressed E-cadherin transcription, an effect partially mediated by Slug. Conversely, inhibition of Brachyury resulted in downregulation of mesenchymal markers and loss of cell migration and invasion and diminished the ability of human tumor cells to form lung metastases in a xenograft model. Furthermore, we found Brachyury to be overexpressed in various human tumor tissues and tumor cell lines compared with normal tissues. We also determined that the percentage of human lung tumor tissues positive for Brachyury expression increased with the stage of the tumor, indicating a potential association between Brachyury and tumor progression. The selective expression of Brachyury in tumor cells and its role in EMT and cancer progression suggest that Brachyury may be an attractive target for antitumor therapies.</str>

      <str>Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is highly metastatic and resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recently, we reported that the T-box transcription factor Brachyury is a potential regulator of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Specifically, growth of CSCs was found to be controlled by Brachyury knockdown in AdCC. Since CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this finding provides a new principle for therapies targeting CSCs. In the present study, we established that Brachyury knockdown suppresses chemoresistance and radioresistance in vitro. Brachyury was knocked down by transfecting Brachyury short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into the AdCC CSC cell line ACCS-M GFP. Brachyury knockdown significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion and suppressed chemoresistance. A quantitative PCR array of drug transporter genes revealed that knockdown of Brachyury caused down-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter genes. Furthermore, ACCS-M GFP radioresistance was significantly suppressed by Brachyury knockdown. Knockdown of Brachyury significantly sensitized ACCS-M GFP cells to chemoradiotherapy. This study demonstrates that Brachyury knockdown reduces invasiveness and chemoresistance and radioresistance of CSCs in vivo. Therefore, Brachyury knockdown may be a useful therapeutic tool for sensitizing CSCs to conventional chemoradiotherapy.</str>

      <str>The expression of Brachyury in human HCC (SMMC7721, HepG2, FHCC98, and Hep3B) and control cell lines was analyzed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoflourence methods. Cancerous tissues collected from patients with HCC (n = 112) were analyzed using immunohistochemical method; a microarray analysis of HCC tissues was performed to explore the clinicopathological variables of HCC. The migratory and invasive capacities of Brachyury-SMMC7721 and Brachyury-HepG2 transfected cells were evaluated using in vitro scratch wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Further, six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice (n = 10) model was used in vivo assay.</str>
      <str>Elevated expression of Brachyury was detected in HCCs (62.5%) compared with that in adjacent nontumorous tissues. Clinicopathological analysis revealed a close correlation of Brachyury expression with distant metastasis and poor prognosis of HCC. Overexpression of Brachyury promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Brachyury overexpression enhanced Akt activation by inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which led to subsequent stabilization of Snail, a critical EMT mediator.</str>

      <str>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be a critical step along the metastasis of carcinomas. In addition to gaining motility and invasiveness, tumor cells that undergo EMT also acquire increased resistance to many traditional cancer treatment modalities, including chemotherapy and radiation. As such, EMT has become an attractive, potentially targetable process for therapeutic interventions against tumor metastasis. The process of EMT is driven by a group of transcription factors designated as EMT transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and the recently identified T-box family member, Brachyury. In an attempt to determine which of these drivers of EMT is more amenable to targeted therapies and, in particular, T-cell-mediated immunotherapeutic approaches, we have examined their relative expression levels in a range of human and murine normal tissues, cancer cell lines, and human tumor biopsies. Our results demonstrated that Brachyury is a molecule with a highly restricted human tumor expression pattern. We also demonstrated that Brachyury is immunogenic and that Brachyury-specific CD8(+) T cells expanded in vitro are able to lyse Brachyury-positive tumor cells. We thus propose Brachyury as an attractive target for vaccination strategies designed to specifically target tumor cells undergoing EMT.</str>

The tumor was clinically diagnosed as a benign neurogenic tumor and the tumor was easily removed surgically. Microscopically, the tumor mainly consisted of tumor cells with extensively vacuolated cytoplasm, arranged in cord- and nest-like fashion against a myxoid matrix background. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed diffuse positivity for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin.

      <str>Chordoma is a neoplasm of notochordal differentiation that typically occurs in the axial skeleton. Accurate diagnosis is therapeutically important but can be challenging, especially in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy (CNB). Immunohistochemistry for the transcription factor brachyury (T) has recently proven diagnostically useful in whole-tissue sections. Our aim was to compare brachyury performance with conventional markers (S-100, EMA, keratin) and to evaluate its utility in distinguishing chordoma from cytomorphologic mimics. Brachyury immunohistochemistry was performed on chordoma (8 FNA, 12 CNB), chondrosarcoma (10 FNA), and metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (12 FNA). Immunohistochemistry performed at the time of diagnosis was also reviewed. Brachyury was positive in 17 (85%) cases of chordoma and typically showed moderate-to-strong nuclear staining. Of five sets of concurrent FNA and CNB, four pairs were positive for brachyury in both samples and one pair was positive for brachyury in the CNB and negative in the cell block. S-100, EMA, and keratin stains were available for 13 chordomas: 9 (69%) cases (including the 3 negative for brachyury) were positive for S-100 and keratin or EMA; 4 cases were keratin positive but S-100 negative. No nuclear brachyury staining was seen in chondrosarcoma or adenocarcinoma, though two adenocarcinomas showed cytoplasmic staining. Brachyury separates chordoma from cytomorphologic mimics with high sensitivity and specificity in small biopsies. As a single test, brachyury has higher sensitivity than a combined panel of S-100 and epithelial markers. When added to the conventional panel, brachyury increases sensitivity to 100% without sacrificing specificity.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are primary malignant tumors of the notochord that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and their clinical relevance in chordoma remain unknown. We evaluated PD-L1 expression in three chordoma cell lines and nine chordoma tissue samples by western blot. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on a chordoma tissue microarray (TMA) that contained 78 tissue specimens. We also correlated the expression of PD-L1 and TILs with clinical outcomes. PD-L1 protein expression was demonstrated to be induced by IFN-γ in both UCH1 and UCH2 cell lines. Across nine human chordoma tissue samples, PD-L1 protein was differentially expressed. 94.9% of chordoma samples showed positive PD-L1 expression in the TMA. The expression score of PD-L1 for metastatic chordoma tumors was significant higher as compared with non-metastatic chordoma tumors. Expression of PD-L1 protein significantly correlates with the presence of elevated TILs, which correlates with metastasis. In summary, our study showed high levels of PD-L1 are expressed in chordoma, which is correlated with the prevalence of TILs. The current study suggests targeting PD-L1 may be a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for chordoma clinical trials. </str>

      <str>The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of Brachyury on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and chemosensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In 115 archived NSCLC tissue samples, the expression of Brachyury was observed to be significantly higher than that in adjacent normal lung tissues. In addition, the current study demonstrated that the expression of Brachyury is closely associated with TNM staging, lymph node metastasis and the prognosis of NSCLC, although not with patient age, gender or tumor differentiation. Brachyury expression is also accompanied by the downregulation of E-cadherin and the upregulation of N-cadherin. Brachyury may promote lung cancer through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which leads to metastasis and consequent poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, the present study observed that interfering with Brachyury increases the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic treatment with cisplatin. These results, in combination with those of additional studies, suggest that Brachyury may be used as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer.</str>

      <str>The embryonic transcription factor brachyury is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, including lung, breast, colon and prostate carcinomas, chordomas and hemangioblastomas. In human carcinoma cells, overexpression of brachyury associates with the occurrence of the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquisition of metastatic propensity and resistance to a variety of anti-cancer therapeutics. Brachyury is preferentially expressed in human tumors vs. normal adult tissues, and high levels of this molecule associate with poor prognosis in patients with lung, colon and prostate carcinomas, and in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Brachyury is immunogenic in humans and vaccines against this novel oncotarget are currently undergoing clinical investigation. While our group and others have employed various anti-brachyury antibodies to interrogate the above findings, we report here on the development and thorough characterization of a novel rabbit monoclonal antibody (MAb 54-1) that reacts with distinct high affinity and specificity with human brachyury. MAb 54-1 was successfully used in ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to evaluate expression of brachyury in various human tumor cell lines and tissues. We propose the use of this antibody to assist in research studies of EMT and in prognostic studies for a range of human tumors. </str>

      <str>Soft tissue chordomas (STCs) have never been systematically studied because of their rarity and the difficulty in separating them from similar-appearing lesions. Using brachyury to confirm the diagnosis, we have analyzed our experience with 11 cases. Cases coded as "chordoma" or "parachordoma" were retrieved from institutional and consultation files (1989 to 2011) and were excluded from further analysis if they arose from the bone or in a patient with previous axial chordoma. Eleven of 27 cases met inclusion criteria. Patients (8 male; 3 female) ranged in age from 13 to 71 years (mean 44 y). Tumors were located on the buttock (n=2), wrist (n=2), leg (n=2), toe (n=1), thumb (n=1), ankle (n=1), shoulder (n=1), and chest wall (n=1), ranged in size from 0.5 to 10.9 cm (mean 5.3 cm), and consisted of cords and syncytia of spindled/epithelioid cells with vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm and a partially myxoid background. Tumors expressed brachyury (10/10), 1 or more cytokeratins (11/11), and S100 protein (10/11). Follow-up information was available for 10 patients (69 mo; range, 2 to 212 mo). Most (n=6) were alive without disease, 2 developed local recurrence and lung metastases, and 1 developed lung metastasis only. One died with unknown disease status. STCs are histologically identical to osseous ones, but differ in their greater tendency to occur in distal locations where small size and surgical resectability result in better disease control. The existence of STC implies that notochordal remnants are not a prerequisite for chordoma development.</str>

However, it is still unknown whether T could regulate the infiltration of macrophages. Here, we report that the Brachyury expression in human lung tumors was inversely correlated with the infiltration of macrophages. Brachyury suppressed the capability of human lung cancer cells to attract macrophages. Using PCR array, we found that Brachyury inhibited expression of several chemokines, including CCL2, CCL4, and CXCL10. Accordingly, knockdown of CCL2 and CCL4 in lung cancer cells suppressed macrophage invasion under coculture conditions. Furthermore, we found that Brachyury expression was inversely correlated with CCL2 and CCL4 expression in human lung tumors. Taken together, our findings shed light on the novel role of Brachyury in regulation of macrophage infiltration. </str>

      <str>When aggregated and treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), P19 embryonal carcinoma cells differentiate into cell types normally derived from the mesoderm and endoderm including epithelium and cardiac and skeletal muscle. The Brachyury gene is expressed transiently in these differentiating cultures several days before the appearance of markers of the differentiated cell types. The expression of Brachyury is not affected by DMSO but is induced by cell aggregation, which requires extracellular calcium. Expression of Brachyury is also induced by various members of the TGF beta family such as activin and bone morphogenetic proteins. D3 is a mutant clone of P19 cells selected for its failure to differentiate when aggregated in DMSO. Aggregated D3 cells express Brachyury mRNA suggesting that the mutation(s) responsible for the phenotype of D3 cells is downstream of the chain of events initiated by Brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare primary bone malignancy that arises in the skull base, spine and sacrum and originates from remnants of the notochord. These tumors are typically resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and to date there are no FDA-approved agents to treat chordoma. The lack of in vivo models of chordoma has impeded the development of new therapies for this tumor. Primary tumor from a sacral chordoma was xenografted into NOD/SCID/IL-2R γ-null mice. The xenograft is serially transplantable and was characterized by both gene expression analysis and whole genome SNP genotyping. The NIH Chemical Genomics Center performed high-throughput screening of 2,816 compounds using two established chordoma cell lines, U-CH1 and U-CH2B. The screen yielded several compounds that showed activity and two, sunitinib and bortezomib, were tested in the xenograft. Both agents slowed the growth of the xenograft tumor. Sensitivity to an inhibitor of IκB, as well as inhibition of an NF-κB gene expression signature demonstrated the importance of NF-κB signaling for chordoma growth. This serially transplantable chordoma xenograft is thus a practical model to study chordomas and perform in vivo preclinical drug testing. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are malignant neoplasms that typically arise in the axial spine and primarily affect adults. When chordomas arise in pediatric patients they are more likely to display unusual histological features and aggressive behavior. We noted the absence of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by immunohistochemistry in an index case of poorly differentiated chordoma of the sacrum, leading us to further examine SMARCB1/INI1 expression as well as that of brachyury, a highly specific marker of notochordal differentiation, in 3 additional poorly differentiated chordomas of the clivus, 10 typical chordomas, and 8 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs). All 4 poorly differentiated chordomas and all AT/RTs lacked nuclear expression of SMARCB1/INI1, while the 10 typical chordomas maintained strong nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 immunoreactivity. All 10 typical and 4 poorly differentiated chordomas expressed brachyury; all 8 AT/RTs were brachyury immunonegative. Cytogenetic evaluation utilizing FISH probes near the SMARCB1/INI1 locus on chromosome 22q was also performed in all of the poorly differentiated chordomas in this series. Three of the four poorly differentiated chordomas had evidence for deletion of this region by FISH. Analysis of the SMARCB1/INI1 gene sequence was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in all cases and no point mutations were observed. In summary, all poorly differentiated chordomas in this series showed the absence of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, and were reliably distinguished from AT/RTs, clinically by their characteristic primary sites of origin and pathologically by strong nuclear brachyury expression. Our findings reveal a likely role for SMARCB1/INI1 in a subset of chordomas with aggressive features.</str>

      <str>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process associated with the metastasis of solid tumors as well as with the acquisition of resistance to standard anticancer modalities. A major initiator of EMT in carcinoma cells is TGF-β, which has been shown to induce the expression of several transcription factors ultimately responsible for initiating and maintaining the EMT program. We have previously identified Brachyury, a T-box transcription factor, as an inducer of mesenchymal features in human carcinoma cells. In this study, a potential link between Brachyury and TGF-β signaling has been investigated. The results show for the first time that Brachyury expression is enhanced during TGF-β1-induced EMT in various human cancer cell lines, and that a positive feedback loop is established between Brachyury and TGF-β1 in mesenchymal-like tumor cells. In this context, Brachyury overexpression is shown to promote upregulation of TGF-β1 at the mRNA and protein levels, an effect mediated by activation of the TGF-β1 promoter in the presence of high levels of Brachyury. Furthermore, inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling by a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-β receptor type I decreases Brachyury expression, induces a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, and renders cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. This study thus has implications for the future development of clinical trials using TGF-β inhibitors in combination with other anticancer agents.</str>

In vitro protein interaction studies showed that the Mixl1 with Brachyury associated via their DNA-binding domains and gel shift assays revealed that the Brachyury T-box domain bound to Mixl1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter experiments indicated that association of Mixl1 with Brachyury and related T-box factors inhibited the transactivating potential of Mixl1 on the Gsc and Pdgfrα promoters.

      <str>Intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumor (BNCT) is a lesion postulated to be of notochordal cell origin. BNCT has recently been recognized as a potential precursor of classic chordoma, a rare malignant neoplasm usually presenting in the sacrococcygeal region, skull base, or mobile spine. Extra-axial chordoma is extremely rare, and only 2 cases of pulmonary chordoma have been reported previously. We describe herein 2 cases of hitherto-unreported lung tumors that were diagnosed as BNCT. The patients were a middle-aged asymptomatic man and woman who were each incidentally found to have a 15-mm pulmonary nodule on computed tomography. They underwent surgical resection of the tumors under a diagnosis of probable benign tumor of uncertain nature. Histopathologically, both tumors showed solid sheets of peculiar adipocyte-like univacuolated cells, multivacuolated cells, and less vacuolated cells with small, round nuclei and mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitosis was absent. These features were typical of BNCT. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells in both cases were positive for brachyury, a transcription factor essential for notochordal cell differentiation and for other markers of notochordal cells including cytokeratins, vimentin, and S-100 protein. Postoperatively, extensive radiographic examination of the whole body revealed no evidence of a primary tumor elsewhere, and both patients are alive and well, with no evidence of disease 1 year after surgery. These 2 cases raise the possibility of a new explanation for the histogenesis of extra-axial chordomas: BNCT may be a precursor lesion of not only conventional axial chordoma but also of extra-axial chordoma.</str>

Identifying and validating novel targets of miR-1 is useful for understanding the roles of miR-1 in chordoma. We aimed to further investigate the functions of miR-1 in chordoma. Specifically, we assessed whether restoration of miR-1 affects cell migration and invasion in chordoma, and focused on the miR-1 potential target Slug gene. Migratory and invasive activities were assessed by wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Slug expression was evaluated by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Restoration of miR-1 expression suppressed the migratory and invasive activities of chordoma cells. Transfection of miR-1 inhibited cell proliferation both time- and dose-dependently in chordoma. MiR-1 transfected cells showed inhibited Slug expression. Slug was over-expressed in chordoma cell lines and advanced chordoma tissues. In conclusion, we have shown that miR-1 directly targets the Slug gene in chordoma. Restoration of miR-1 suppressed not only proliferation, but also migratory and invasive activities, and reduced the Slug expression in chordoma cells. These results collectively indicate that miR-1/Slug pathway is a potential therapeutic target because of its crucial roles in chordoma cell growth and migration.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare primary malignant bone tumours that derive from notochord precursor cells and express brachyury, a molecule involved in notochord development. Little is known about the genetic events responsible for driving the growth of this tumour, but it is well established that brachyury is regulated through fibroblastic growth factor receptors (FGFRs) through RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and ETS2 in ascidian, Xenopus and zebrafish, although little is known about its regulation in mammals. The aim of this study was to attempt to identify the molecular genetic events that are responsible for the pathogenesis of chordomas with particular focus on the FGFR signalling pathway on the basis of the evidence in the ascidian and Xenopus models that the expression of brachyury requires the activation of this pathway. Immunohistochemistry showed that 47 of 50 chordomas (94%) expressed at least one of the FGFRs, and western blotting showed phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 alpha (FRS2alpha), an adaptor signalling protein, that links FGFR to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Screening for mutations in brachyury (all coding exons and promoter), FGFRs 1-4 (previously reported mutations), KRAS (codons 12, 13, 51, 61) and BRAF (exons 11 and 15) failed to show any genetic alterations in 23 chordomas. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis on FGFR4, ETS2 and brachyury failed to show either amplification of these genes, although there was minor allelic gain in brachyury in three tumours, or translocation for ERG and ETS2 loci. The key genetic events responsible for the initiation and progression of chordomas remain to be discovered.</str>

Recent studies revealed that expression of miRNA-1 (miR-1) is frequently downregulated in several cancer types including chordoma. The goal of this follow-up study is to investigate the expression of miR-1 as a prognostic biomarker and further confirm the functional role of miR-1 in chordoma cell growth and proliferation. We determined the relative expression levels of miR-1 and Met in chordoma tissue samples and correlated those to clinical variables. The results showed that miR-1 was downregulated in 93.7% of chordoma tissues and expression was inversely correlated with Met expression. miR-1 expression levels also correlated with clinical prognosis. To characterize and confirm the functional role of miR-1 in the growth and proliferation of chordoma cells, miR-1 precursors were stably transfected into chordoma cell lines UCH-1 and CH-22. Cell Proliferation Assay and MTT were used to evaluate cell growth and proliferation. Restoring expression of miR-1 precursor decreased cell growth and proliferation in UCH-1 and CH-22 cells. These results indicate that suppressed miR-1 expression in chordoma may in part be a driver for tumor growth, and that miR-1 has potential to serve as prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for chordoma patients.</str>

The relative expression levels of these miRNAs were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. To characterize the potential role of miRNA-1, miRNA-1 was stably transfected into a chordoma cell line, UCH1. The expression of miRNA-1 targeted gene Met in chordoma tissues was also studied. We observe that human chordoma tissues and cell lines can be distinguished from normal muscle tissue by comparing miRNA expression profiles. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed in chordoma cell lines compared to controls, and similar expression patterns were found in primary chordoma tissues. Importantly, we were able to show for the first time, to our knowledge, that expression of miRNA-1 and miRNA-206, two miRNAs implicated in a number of other cancer types, were markedly decreased in both chordoma tissues and cell lines. When chordoma cell lines were transfected with miRNA-1, downregulation of known miRNA-1 targets was observed. These targets included Met and HDAC4-two genes that were observed to be overexpressed in chordoma. Our results demonstrate that some miRNAs are differentially expressed in chordoma and, in particular, miRNA-1 may have a functional effect on chordoma tumor pathogenesis.</str>

      <str>Chordomas of the tip of the tail in 6 ferrets were examined using histopathological, histochemical and immunohistochemical procedures. Histopathologically, round neoplastic cells containing numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles of varying sizes, categorized as "physaliphorous cells", were observed in the amorphous eosinophilic or pale basophilic myxoid stroma. Physaliphorous cells were arranged in lobules and in a "chordoid" or "cobblestone" manner. The neoplasms were diagnosed as benign chordoma without local invasion and metastasis. Histochemically, the cytoplasm of small neoplastic cells was positive for periodic acid-Schiff stain and alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5 and pH 1.0 stains, but negative for hyaluronidase digestion-AB pH 2.5 stain. All neoplastic cells were strongly stained with colloidal ion, negative for high iron diamine AB pH 2.5 and toluidine blue pH 2.5 stains, and positive for Mayer's mucicarmine stain. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against low-molecular-weight cytokeratins (CK18, CK19 and CK20), vimentin and mucin core protein (MUC5AC) revealed that neoplastic cells had both epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The expression of low-molecular-weight cytokeratins suggests that neoplastic cells acquired the properties of glandular epithelial cells and produced epithelial mucus. Furthermore, the expression of cytokeratins, vimentin, S100 protein, brachyury and epithelial membrane antigen indicates that the neoplasms were equivalent to the classic type of human chordoma. Therefore, immunohistochemistry using these antibodies can be useful for the characterization of ferret chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a malignant tumor thought to arise from remnants of the embryonic notochord, with its origin in the bones of the axial skeleton. Surgical resection is the standard treatment, usually in combination with radiation therapy, but neither chemotherapeutic nor targeted therapeutic approaches have demonstrated success. No animal model and only few chordoma cell lines are available for preclinical drug testing, and, although no druggable genetic drivers have been identified, activation of EGFR and downstream AKT-PI3K pathways have been described. Here, we report a zebrafish model of chordoma, based on stable transgene-driven expression of HRASV12 in notochord cells during development. Extensive intra-notochordal tumor formation is evident within days of transgene expression, ultimately leading to larval death. The zebrafish tumors share characteristics of human chordoma as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, which has some demonstrated activity in a chordoma cell line, delays the onset of tumor formation in our zebrafish model, and improves survival of tumor-bearing fish. Consequently, the HRASV12-driven zebrafish model of chordoma could enable high-throughput screening of potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of this refractory cancer. </str>

      <str>Sacral chordoma is an aggressive, locally invasive neoplasm, and has a poor prognosis. However, the molecular basis for the clinical behavior remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in sacral chordoma, and explore their roles in the prognosis. PTEN and mTOR were detected immunohistochemically in 40 sacral chordoma tissues and 10 adjacent normal tissues. Correlations between PTEN and mTOR expression and clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test were used to analyze the continuous disease-free survival time (CDFS). The expression of PTEN in sacral chordoma was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissues, while the levels of mTOR expression in sacral chordoma were significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.000, P = 0.030). The positive expression of mTOR appears to correlate with the negative expression of PTEN in sacral chordoma (P = 0.021). PTEN-negative expression and mTOR-positive expression were associated with tumor invasion into the surrounding muscles (P = 0.038, P = 0.014). Log-rank test showed that PTEN-negative and mTOR-positive expressions had an important impact on the patients' CDFS (P = 0.011, P = 0.015). Our results suggest that PTEN and mTOR might play an important role in the local invasiveness of sacral chordoma.

      <str>Immortal tumor cell lines are an important model system for cancer research, however, misidentification and cross-contamination of cell lines are a common problem. Seven chordoma cell lines are reported in the literature, but none has been characterized in detail. We analyzed gene expression patterns and genomic copy number variations in five putative chordoma cell lines (U-CH1, CCL3, CCL4, GB60, and CM319). We also created a new chordoma cell line, U-CH2, and provided genotypes for cell lines for identity confirmation. Our analyses revealed that CCL3, CCL4, and GB60 are not chordoma cell lines, and that CM319 is a cancer cell line possibly derived from chordoma, but lacking expression of key chordoma biomarkers. U-CH1 and U-CH2 both have gene expression profiles, copy number aberrations, and morphology consistent with chordoma tumors. These cell lines also harbor genetic changes, such as loss of p16, MTAP, or PTEN, that make them potentially useful models for studying mechanisms of chordoma pathogenesis and for evaluating targeted therapies.</str>

      <str>Sacral chordoma is a rare and aggressive tumor, with a high rate of local recurrence even when the tumor is radically resected. The fundamental knowledge of its biological behavior remains unknown. Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is one of the RNA binding proteins and is expressed during embryogenesis and in various malignant tumors. This study evaluated expression of IMP3 in sacral chordoma for association with patient's clinicopathological factors. A total of 32 patients with sacral chordoma (17 male and 15 female) and 10 samples of distant normal tissues were collected for analysis of IMP3 expression using immunohistochemistry. Association between IMP3 expression and clinicopathological factors (such as patient's age, gender, tumor location, tumor size, surrounding muscle invasion, Ki-67 expression, and tumor recurrence) were statistically analyzed. IMP3 was expressed in 20 (62.5%) patients, whereas there was no expression in the 10 distant normal tissues. IMP3 expression was associated with tumor invasion into the surrounding muscle (P = 0.028), high levels of Ki-67 expression (P = 0.009), and tumor recurrence (P = 0.012). The log-rank test revealed that patients with positive IMP3 expression had a shorter continuous disease-free survival time than those with negative IMP3 expression (P = 0.016). IMP3 expression was independent of age, gender, tumor location and tumor size. These results indicate that IMP3 was overexpressed in sacral chordoma and this expression was associated with tumor invasion and recurrence; thus, IMP3 may play an important role in tumor progression and could serve as a prognostic biomarker for sacral chordoma and IMP3 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sacral chordoma.</str>

Bioinformatical analysis revealed that the potential target genes of these miRNAs were mainly involved in gene transcription, cell junction proteins, and gene pathways in cancer and endocytosis. Reduced miR-1237-3p expression was associated with tumor invasion and worse recurrence-free survival of spinal chordoma patients (χ (2) = 16.217, p = 0.000, log-rank test).

      <str>Identification of tumor antigens is essential in advancing immune-based therapeutic interventions in cancer. Particularly attractive targets are those molecules that are selectively expressed by malignant cells and that are also essential for tumor progression.</str>
      <str>We have used a computer-based differential display analysis tool for mining of expressed sequence tag clusters in the human Unigene database and identified Brachyury as a novel tumor antigen. Brachyury, a member of the T-box transcription factor family, is a key player in mesoderm specification during embryonic development. Moreover, transcription factors that control mesoderm have been implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been postulated to be a key step during tumor progression to metastasis. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis validated the in silico predictions and showed Brachyury expression in tumors of the small intestine, stomach, kidney, bladder, uterus, ovary, and testis, as well as in cell lines derived from lung, colon, and prostate carcinomas, but not in the vast majority of the normal tissues tested. An HLA-A0201 epitope of human Brachyury was identified that was able to expand T lymphocytes from blood of cancer patients and normal donors with the ability to lyse Brachyury-expressing tumor cells.</str>

      <str>Differentiation and malignant transformation of stem cells are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. We analyzed promoter methylation and expression of the stem cell determining genes Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28, NESTIN and ZFP42 depending on the differentiation state in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECC) and somatic tumor cells. Differentiation of MSC into osteoblasts and adipocytes was accompanied with a loss of expression of the Brachyury gene and downregulation of LIN28. Inactivation of Brachyury was associated with progressive methylation of its CpG island promoter. In ECC promoter methylation of stem cell markers was more frequent in the differentiated subgroup (71%) compared to undifferentiated ECC (29%) and this was associated with downregulation of Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42. DPPA5 was methylated and NESTIN was unmethylated in most tumor cells. In somatic tumor cells, methylation of stem cell markers (Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42) was frequently observed (85%). Treatment of cell lines with an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase reactivated the expression of DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42, indicating that aberrant promoter methylation is a crucial event that results in their silencing. Our results suggest that epigenetic inactivation of stem cell associated genes is mediated by promoter methylation and that this may represent a fundamental mechanism during normal differentiation processes.</str>

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between fascin expression and tumor biological behavior in skull base chordoma. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we investigated the expression of fascin in 34 patients with skull base chordomas (19 primary tumors and 20 recurrent tumors). Correlation between fascin expression and clinicopathological factors such as patient's age, sex, tumor locations, and fascin expression in recurrent tumor and in tumor with dura mater erosion was analyzed. Various extent of fascin expression was observed in all tumors. There was a higher fascin expression in recurrent chordoma than in primary chordoma, and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.031). No difference of fascin expression was found between histology types. Interestingly, in 8 tumors where the cranial base dura was eroded, there was a high level of fascin expression (p=0.047). These immunohistochemical findings suggest that fascin expression was correlated with tumor recurrence and high invasiveness, and that fascin overexpression may play an important role in the biologic behavior of skull base chordomas.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a relatively rare malignant bone tumor thought to arise from the remnants of the fetal notochord. Chordomas express epithelial cell markers such as cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), which strongly suggests that the tumor cells grow via the mechanism of epithelial characterized cell-cell interactions. However, there are no known reports that have studied epithelial characterized cell-adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) in chordomas. An immunohistochemical investigation was performed in seven cases of chordoma to determine the expression of pan-cytokeratin, Ep-CAM, and E-cadherin. Histological specimens showed the typical appearance of conventional chordoma but for two cases of chondroid chordoma. Cytokeratin was constantly expressed in conventional chordomas, but it was detected among a few cells with physaliphorous appearance in chondroid chordoma cases. Although no Ep-CAM expression was noted, E-cadherin was detected in most chordoma cells irrespective of histological subtypes. The expression of E-cadherin was negative among chondrosarcoma cells in this study as previously reported, and thus constant E-cadherin expression of chordoma cells suggests a role as a useful diagnostic marker to distinguish chondroid chordoma from chondrosarcoma. Furthermore, we speculate that E-cadherin may play a role in tumor cell adhesion and is also involved with histological and clinical features in chordomas.</str>

      <str>Aberrant expression of the T-box transcription factor brachyury in human carcinomas drives the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a phenotypic modulation that facilitates tumor dissemination and resistance to conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. By generating isogenic cancer cell lines with various levels of brachyury expression, we demonstrate that high levels of brachyury also significantly reduce the susceptibility of cancer cells to lysis by both antigen-specific T cells and natural killer cells. Our results indicated that resistance of brachyury-high tumor cells to immune-mediated attack was due to inefficient caspase-dependent apoptosis, manifested as inefficient nuclear lamin degradation in the presence of activated effector caspases. We correlated this phenomenon with loss of cell-cycle-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which mediates lamin phosphorylation. In support of a causal connection, pretreatment of tumor cells with a specific inhibitor of WEE1, a negative regulator kinase of CDK1, could counter the defective apoptosis of tumor cells expressing high levels of brachyury. Thus, our findings suggested that reconstituting CDK1 activity to threshold levels may be sufficient to restore immunosurveillance of mesenchymal-like cancer cells that have escaped previous immune detection or eradication.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare and low-malignant neoplasm which is considered to arise from notochord remnants. Due to its large resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical resection so far is the prior treatment for chordoma. However, the recurrence rate is high even after complete surgical resection. Recently, targeted cancer therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in several other tumors, while the related research on chordoma is rare. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway is acknowledged to participate in tumor development, in which Raf-1 and extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) play vital roles. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 by immunohistochemical staining in 42 chordoma tissue and 16 distant normal tissue. Moreover, we also investigated the correlations of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 expression with clinical features in sacral chordoma. Expression of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 was both significantly higher in sacral chordoma tissue than distant normal tissue (P = 0.008, P = 0.019). Raf-1 positive expression was related to surrounding muscle invasion (P = 0.032) and chordoma recurrence (P = 0.002), but the results did not indicate any association with patients' age, gender, tumor size and location. ERK1/2 was associated with tumor size (P = 0.044) instead of other clinical factors (P &gt; 0.05). Spearman correlation test showed close relation between ERK1/2 and Raf-1 (P = 0.001, r = 0.518). Kaplan-Meier survival Curve and log-rank test showed that Raf-1 positive expression was associated with shorter continuous disease-free survival time (CDFS) (P = 0.001), while ERK1/2 had no relation to CDFS (P = 0.961). Conclusively, Raf-1 may be an important biomarker in predicting the prognosis of chordoma patients. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant tumors that originate from the notochord remnants and occur in the skull base, spine and sacrum. Due to a very limited understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of chordoma, there are no adjuvant and molecular therapies besides surgical resection and radiation therapy. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNA molecules with critical roles in cancer. The role of miRNAs in chordomas is mostly unknown. We uncover microRNA-608 (miR-608) and microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as novel tumor suppressive microRNAs that regulate malignancy in chordoma. We find that miR-608 and miR-34a expressions are downregulated in human chordoma cell lines and primary cells at least partially via alteration of their genes' copy numbers. We identify the commonly deregulated oncogenes EGFR and Bcl-xL as direct targets of miR-608 and the receptor tyrosine kinase MET as direct target of miR-34a. We show that EGFR and MET activations promote chordoma cell proliferation and invasion and that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and MET inhibits chordoma cell proliferation and survival. We demonstrate that restoration of miR-608 and miR-34a inhibits cell proliferation and invasion and induces apoptosis in chordoma cells. We find that miR-34a inversely correlates with MET expression and miR-608 inversely correlates with EGFR expression in chordoma cells. These findings demonstrate for the first time that miR-608 and miR-34a regulate chordoma malignancy by regulating EGFR, MET and Bcl-xL. </str>

      <str>Invasive growth of chordoma is accompanied by severe destruction of adjacent bone tissue, a fact that requires high proteolytic activity at the tumor invasion fronts. In this context, cathepsin K is a candidate molecule. It is a protease with high collagenolytic and elastinolytic activity and previously thought to be restricted to osteoclasts and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In this study, 44 cases of chordoma of sphenooccipital localization, and 10 embryo-fetal specimens including chorda dorsalis were studied immunohistochemically for their expression of cathepsin K. In 4 additional snap-frozen chordoma cases, the enzyme expression was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme histochemistry. Ten chondrosarcomas of the skull base served as controls. Various concentrations of cathepsin K mRNA could be seen in all snap-frozen chordoma specimens. The protease was immunohistochemically expressed by the tumor cells. The immunoreactions were accentuated at the tumor invasion fronts. Enzyme histochemistry indicated a strong tumor cell-associated cathepsin K activity in invasive tumor components. In contrast to chordoma, cathepsin K was not significantly expressed in chorda dorsalis and chondrosarcoma of the skull base. In chondrosarcoma, protease expression was limited to osteoclastic cells localized between infiltrative tumor components and regular bone trabeculae. This study shows the significant expression and activity of cathepsin K in chordoma and implicates an important and direct role of this protease in the infiltrative growth of this tumor. This protease expression occurred during neoplastic transformation and did not appear in chorda dorsalis.</str>

      <str>A major obstacle in the effective treatment of chordoma is that there are no identifiable biomarkers capable of predicting prognosis. Recent research has indicated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat3) may be an important prognostic marker in some cancers, but its role in chordoma tumors has not been elucidated. In this study, the expression of Stat3 was evaluated in chordoma tissue microarray that contains 70 chordoma samples. Cells in the tissue microarray showed nuclear staining for phosphorylated Stat3 in all instances. The level of phosphorylated Stat3 expression correlated with the survival and severity of the disease. Three chordoma cell lines were exposed to SD-1029, a novel inhibitor of Stat3 activation. MTT assay showed that the growth of all chordoma cell lines was inhibited by SD-1029. The expression of Stat3 signaling cascade was inhibited in all chordoma cell lines after treatment with SD-1029. The cytotoxicity of the combination of SD-1029 and chemotherapeutic drugs is significantly better than either agent alone. Phosphorylation of Stat3 in chordoma cells in vitro and cellular proliferation in three-dimensional culture were inhibited by SD-1029. In conclusion, the Stat3 pathway is constitutively activated in chordomas and the level of expression may serve as a predictor for prognosis. Blockade of the Stat3 pathway represents a potential strategy for future treatment.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, locally invasive tumors with characteristic expression of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury. Little is yet known of the molecular events involved in the development of these tumors. Bone morphogenesis protein 4 (BMP4) signaling, which acts upstream of Brachyury in embryonic development, has been implicated in carcinogenesis in multiple malignancies. To explore the role of the canonical BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of chordoma, we investigated, in 40 skull base chordomas, the expression of three major components of the signaling axis: BMP4, phospho-SMAD5 and SMAD4. Immunostaining revealed positive expression in 70%, 52.5% and 90% of cases, respectively. Eighteen (45%) of patients exhibited concurrent positive expression of these markers, which we defined as "high" expression of the BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway. Interestingly, when we compared the pattern of expression with clinicopathological parameters, we found that high expression of the pathway was more often observed in larger tumors (≥ 4 cm) than smaller ones (P = 0.010), and correlated significantly with dural invasion (P = 0.024). The Kaplan-Meier log-rank test showed that the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with high expression of the pathway was significantly lower than those with low expression (71.4% vs. 90.2%, P = 0.010). In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that overexpression of the BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway could predict poor clinical outcome in skull base chordomas, suggesting activation of this pathway is involved in chordoma pathogenesis. </str>

      <str>Chordoid meningioma, World Health Organization grade II, is an uncommon variant of meningioma with a propensity for aggressive behavior and increased likelihood of recurrence. As such, recognition of this entity is important in cases that show similar morphologic overlap with other chondroid/myxoid neoplasms that can arise within or near the central nervous system. A formal comparison of the immunohistochemical features of chordoid meningioma versus tumors with significant histologic overlap has not been previously reported. In this study, immunohistochemical staining was performed with antibodies against D2-40, S100, pankeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), brachyury, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 4 cases of chordoid glioma, 6 skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, 10 chordoid meningiomas, 16 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, 18 chordomas, 22 low-grade chondrosarcomas, and 27 enchondromas. Staining extent and intensity were evaluated semiquantitatively and mean values for each parameter were calculated. Immunostaining with D2-40 showed positivity in 100% of skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, 96% of enchondromas, 95% of low-grade chondrosarcomas, 80% of chordoid meningiomas, and 75% of chordoid gliomas. Staining with S100 demonstrated diffuse, strong positivity in all (100%) chordoid gliomas, skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and enchondromas, 94% of chordomas, and 81% of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, with focal, moderate staining in 40% of chordoid meningiomas. Pankeratin highlighted 100% of chordoid gliomas and chordomas, 38% of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, and 20% of chordoid meningiomas. EMA staining was positive in 100% of chordoid gliomas, 94% of chordomas, 90% of chordoid meningiomas, and 25% of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. Brachyury was positive only in the chordomas (100%), whereas GFAP was positive only in the chordoid gliomas (100%). EMA was the most effective antibody for differentiating chordoid meningioma from skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, low-grade chondrosarcoma, and enchondroma, whereas D2-40 was the most effective antibody for differentiating chordoid meningioma from extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and chordoma. Our findings demonstrate that in conjunction with clinical and radiographic findings, immunohistochemical evaluation with a panel of D2-40, EMA, brachyury, and GFAP is most useful in distinguishing chordoid meningioma from chordoid glioma, skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, chordoma, low-grade chondrosarcoma, and enchondroma. A lack of strong, diffuse S100 reactivity may also be useful in excluding chordoid meningioma. Among the neoplasms evaluated, brachyury and GFAP proved to be both sensitive and specific markers for chordoma and chordoid glioma, respectively. Of note, this study is the first to characterize the D2-40 immunoprofile in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, results that could be of utility in differential diagnostic assessment.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a well-known bone tumor that shows epithelioid features and in which the expression of cytokeratins (CKs) has been reported to appear very frequently. Numerous immunohistochemical analyses of CK expression have been conducted using such monoclonal antibodies as CAM5.2, which react with CK8, CK18, and CK19, and AE1/AE3, which react with CKs 1-8, 10, 14-16 and 19 in chordoma. No detailed analysis, however, of the expression of each component of CK has yet been conducted in chordoma; thus, the subsets of CK expressed there have yet to be clarified. With the use of immunohistochemical techniques with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against each subset of CK, the authors studied the expression of CKs in 16 specimens of classic chordoma and 14 specimens of the fetal notochord to clarify the subsets of CK expressed in chordoma and to evaluate the similarities and differences of CK expression between chordoma and the fetal notochord. All of the chordoma specimens showed a strong positive immunoreactivity for CK8 and CK19, whereas nine (56.3%) chordoma specimens showed a positive immunoreaction for CK18. In addition, four chordoma specimens were focally positive for keratin-903, which reacts with high molecular weight CKs such as CK1, CK5, CK10, and CK14; one specimen also showed a strong CK7 expression. All of the notochord specimens were also positive for CK8 and CK19, but none showed a positive immunoreaction for keratin-903, CK7, or CK18. In addition, none of the chordoma or notochord specimens showed immunoreactivity for CK20. The expression of CK8 and CK19, observed in all of the chordoma and notochord specimens, was thus considered to be maintained throughout the neoplastic transformation, although some aberrant CK expressions (CK7, CK18, and keratin-903) also occurred in the chordoma specimens examined in this study.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare and invasive malignant tumor which primarily relies on surgical treatments. Anticipation of its recurrence and patient survival longevity has been a critical issue of the treatments. This retrospective study examined the survivin expression of sacral chordoma in 30 patients undergoing surgery in our hospital from January 2000 to July 2010, and compared it with chordoma recurrence. Survivin expression was 70 % positive in 30 patients. The positive expression of survivin with recurrence was significantly higher than that without recurrence (p = 0.017) and was inversely related to the continuous disease-free survival time (p &lt; 0.001). Survivin expression was associated with recurrence. The correlation suggested that the survivin expression could be used as an independent predictor of recurrence and could be a potential bio-target gene of angiogenesis in sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>By using computational differential display approach we identified a number of UniGene clusters which comprised 90% or more of ESTs from tumor cDNA libraries. One of them was cluster Hs.389457 which corresponds to the human gene Brachyury (T). That encodes a T-box gene family member transcription factor which is pivotal in early embryonal development. To experimentally verify our in silico findings of T expression, PCR was conducted using panels of cDNA from various human normal and tumor tissues. According to our results, Brachynry is expressed in tumors of the digestive tract, testis, ovary, breast, kidney, bladder, lung and brain tunic as well as in lymphomas. Weak amplification signals were picked up from normal tissues of small intestine, spleen and testis. Our results support earlier hypothesis on predominant tumor-related expression of Brachyury gene in adults.</str>

      <str>Reverse transcription-PCR and Northern and Western blot analyses indicate that mRNA and protein encoded by the Brachyury gene are expressed by the pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTERA2 and are only modestly down-regulated during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. This differentiation occurs along a neural lineage, with no obvious evidence of the formation of mesodermal derivatives. Several other human embryonal carcinoma cell lines that do not differentiate, a yolk sac carcinoma cell line and two choriocarcinoma cell lines, also express readily detectable levels of Brachyury mRNA and protein.

      <str>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has become an important adjunct tool in diagnostic neuro-oncology practice enabling immunophenotypic characterization of tumor cells. There have been several recent publications regarding new IHC markers that are useful for diagnosis of brain tumors. To introduce the latest advances in IHC in this field, we review the features of novel IHC marker antibodies applicable to selected nonglial tumors in the nervous system, based on recently published reports and our own experiences. We discuss (1) aquaporin-1 and alpha-inhibin for hemangioblastoma, (2) beta-catenin for craniopharyngioma, (3) brachyury for chordoma, and (4) INI-1 for hereditary schwannomas. All the markers presented here are used primarily for supporting or confirming the histologic diagnosis, with the exception of (4), which may be of help in identification of inherited forms in schwannomas. As with other surgical pathology practices, the judicious use of a panel of IHC antibodies selected on the basis of the histologic findings is important for an accurate diagnosis of brain tumors. Of note is that IHC results should be always interpreted in the histopathologic context.</str>

      <str>By means of immunohistochemical techniques that incorporated a panel of monoclonal antibodies against cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin, and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), the expression of CAMs was studied in 15 specimens of chordoma and eight specimens of chondrosarcoma.</str>
      <str>Most chordoma specimens showed some positive immunoreactivity for all the CAMs examined. For the various CAMs investigated, between two and five cases showed diffuse immunoreactions, indicating well preserved expression. Well preserved expression of all the CAMs examined was limited to only one case, thus indicating that the expression of CAMs was decreased in most of the chordoma specimens; however, no significant correlation was found between the decreased expression of CAMs and the histological grade of malignancy, cellular growth pattern, or clinical parameters in chordoma. In chondrosarcoma, only a few specimens showed positive immunoreactivity for CAMs and the expression of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin, and NCAM was seen more frequently in the chordoma specimens than in the chondrosarcoma specimens.</str>
      <str>These results suggest that the expression of CAMs is associated with the formation and maintenance of chordoma tissue architecture, just as it is in other epithelial tumours or normal tissue.

      <str>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are initiating cells in colorectal cancer (CRC). Colorectal tumours undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like processes at the invasive front, enabling invasion and metastasis, and recent studies have linked this process to the acquisition of stem cell-like properties. It is of fundamental importance to understand the molecular events leading to the establishment of cancer initiating cells and how these mechanisms relate to cellular transitions during tumourigenesis. We use an in vitro system to recapitulate changes in CRC cells at the invasive front (mesenchymal-like cells) and central mass (epithelial-like cells) of tumours. We show that the mesoderm inducer BRACHYURY is expressed in a subpopulation of CRC cells that resemble invasive front mesenchymal-like cells, where it acts to impose characteristics of CSCs in a fully reversible manner, suggesting reversible formation and modulation of such cells. BRACHYURY, itself regulated by the oncogene β-catenin, influences NANOG and other 'stemness' markers including a panel of markers defining CRC-CSC whose presence has been linked to poor patient prognosis. Similar regulation of NANOG through BRACHYURY was observed in other cells lines, suggesting this might be a pathway common to cancer cells undergoing mesenchymal transition. We suggest that BRACHYURY may regulate NANOG in mesenchymal-like CRC cells to impose a 'plastic-state', allowing competence of cells to respond to signals prompting invasion or metastasis.</str>

      <str>Hemangioblastoma (HBL) accounts for up to 2.5% of all intracranial tumors. It may occur as a sporadic entity or as a part of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Patients with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are also at an increased risk of developing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). The distinction of HBL from CCRCC metastatic to the central nervous system (CNS) or from other histologic mimics can be challenging at times when based solely on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. In the present study we evaluated the potential use of the immunohistochemical evaluation of brachyury protein in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. Archival tissues from 22 HBLs, 16 primary CCRCCs, 8 CCRCCs metastatic to the CNS, and 4 angiomatous and 4 clear cell meningiomas were retrieved from our surgical pathology files and submitted to the immunohistochemical procedures against brachyury. Cases showing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining were considered to be positive for brachyury. Positive cytoplasmic staining was evidenced in the stromal cells of 20 of the 22 HBLs. In most cases, &gt;50% of the neoplastic cells were labeled, with strong or moderate intensity of staining. No nuclear or cytoplasmic staining for brachyury was observed in any of the primary renal or metastatic CCRCCs, nor in either of the meningioma types. Thus, brachyury cytoplasmic staining was demonstrated to be highly specific for HBL (specificity, 100%) and represented a sensible (sensitivity, 91%) method, with high positive (100%) and negative (89%) predictive values and high diagnostic accuracy (95%) in the differential diagnosis between HBL and CCRCC metastatic to the CNS or meningioma. On the basis of our findings we propose the use of brachyury as an additional helpful immunohistochemical marker to resolve the differential diagnosis of HBL toward histologic mimics.</str>

      <str>OBJECT Although chondrosarcomas rarely arise in the skull base, chondrosarcomas and chordomas are the 2 major malignant bone neoplasms occurring at this location. The distinction of these 2 tumors is important, but this distinction is occasionally problematic because of radiological and histological overlap. Unlike chordoma and extracranial chondrosarcoma, no case series presenting a whole-genome analysis of skull base chondrosarcomas (SBCSs) has been reported. The goal of this study is to clarify the genetic characteristics of SBCSs and contrast them with those of chordomas. METHODS The authors analyzed 7 SBCS specimens for chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). They also examined IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and brachyury expression. RESULTS In CGH analyses, the authors detected CNAs in 6 of the 7 cases, including chromosomal gains of 8q21.1, 19, 2q22-q32, 5qcen-q14, 8q21-q22, and 15qcen-q14. Mutation of IDH1 was found with a high frequency (5 of 7 cases, 71.4%), of which R132S was most frequently mutated. No IDH2 mutations were found, and immunohistochemical staining for brachyury was negative in all cases. CONCLUSIONS To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first whole-genome study of an SBSC case series. Their findings suggest that these tumors are molecularly consistent with a subset of conventional central chondrosarcomas and different from skull base chordomas. </str>

      <str>Parachordoma is a rare soft tissue tumor that morphologically resembles chordoma of the axial skeleton but occurs in a peripheral site. A recent study reported immunohistochemical differences between chordoma and parachordoma. While both tumors were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 8/18 (as recognized by the antibody Cam5.2), S100 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), only the chordoma was positive for CK7, CK20, CK 1/5/10/14 (as recognized by the antibody 34betaE12) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). It has since been suggested that tumors indistinguishable from chordoma that involve the periphery should be termed chordoma periphericum and that these tumors are distinct from parachordoma. In the current study, the clinical, radiological, pathological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of a chordoma-like tumor involving the deep soft tissues of the lower leg of a 69-year-old woman are presented. Microscopically, the tumor had a pseudolobulated growth pattern and consisted of sheets, nests and cords of epithelioid cells, some with a physaliferous appearance, separated by abundant myxoid stroma. The tumor cells were positive for CK 8/18, EMA and S100, showed focal staining for CK7, and were negative for CK20, CK 1/5/10/14 and CEA. On the basis of these results a diagnosis of parachordoma was favored. For comparison, an immunohistochemical analysis of five axial chordomas was also performed. The chordomas showed positivity for CK 8/18 (5 of 5 cases), EMA (5 of 5 cases), S100 (5 of 5 cases), CK 1/5/10/14 (1 of 5 cases) and CK7 (1 of 5 cases). Stains for CK20 and CEA were negative in all five chordomas. The results of the present study suggest that the expression of antigens for CK 1/5/10/14, CK7, CK20 and CEA in chordoma might not be as common as what has been previously reported. The results also suggest that parachordoma might not be easily distinguished immunohistochemically from axial chordoma (and therefore also from so-called chordoma periphericum).</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare tumor arising in the sacrum, clivus, or vertebrae. It is often not completely resectable and shows a high incidence of recurrence and progression with shortened patient survival and impaired quality of life. Chemotherapeutic options are limited to investigational therapies at present. Therefore, adjuvant therapy for control of tumor recurrence and progression is of great interest, especially in skull base lesions where complete tumor resection is often not possible because of the proximity of cranial nerves. To understand the extent of genetic instability and associated chromosomal and gene losses or gains in skull base chordoma, we undertook whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis of flash frozen surgical chordoma specimens, 21 from the clivus and 1 from C1 to C2 vertebrae. We confirm the presence of a deletion at 9p involving CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP but at a much lower rate (22%) than previously reported for sacral chordoma. At a similar frequency (21%), we found aneuploidy of chromosome 3. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry demonstrated absent or reduced fragile histidine triad (FHIT) protein expression in 98% of sacral chordomas and 67%of skull base chordomas. Our data suggest that chromosome 3 aneuploidy and epigenetic regulation of FHIT contribute to loss of the FHIT tumor suppressor in chordoma. The finding that FHIT is lost in a majority of chordomas provides new insight into chordoma pathogenesis and points to a potential new therapeutic target for this challenging neoplasm.</str>

      <str>This work concerns the formation of mesoderm in the development of an enteropneust hemichordate, Ptychodera flava, and the expression of the Brachyury gene during this process. Brachyury expression occurs in two distinct phases. In the embryo, Brachyury is transcribed during gastrulation in the future oral and anal regions of the gut, but transcripts are no longer detected by 2 weeks of development. Brachyury expression is not detected during the 5 months of larval planktonic existence. During this time, the adult coeloms begin to develop, originating as coalescences of cells that appear to delaminate from the wall of the gut. Brachyury expression cannot be detected again until metamorphosis, when transcripts appear in the mesoderm of the adult proboscis, collar and the very posterior region of the trunk. It is also expressed in the posterior end of the gut. At no time is Brachyury expressed in the stomochord, the putative homologue of the chordate notochord. These observations illuminate the process of maximal indirect development in Ptychodera and, by comparison with patterns of Brachyury expression in the indirect development of echinoderms, their sister group, they reveal the evolutionary history of Brachyury utilization in deuterostomes.</str>

      <str>The high frequencies of recurrence and distant metastasis of adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) emphasize the need to better understand the biological factors associated with these outcomes. To analyze the mechanisms of AdCC metastasis, we established the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-transfected subline ACCS-GFP from the AdCC parental cell line and the metastatic ACCS-M GFP line from an in vivo metastasis model.</str>
      <str>Using these cell lines, we investigated the involvement of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSCs) in AdCC metastasis by real-time RT-PCR for EMT related genes and stem cell markers. Characteristics of CSCs were also analyzed by sphere-forming ability and tumorigenicity. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing of target gene was also performed.</str>
      <str>ACCS-M GFP demonstrated characteristics of EMT and additionally displayed sphere-forming ability and high expression of EMT-related genes (Snail, Twist1, Twist2, Slug, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and 2 [Zeb1 and Zeb2], glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [Gsk3β and transforming growth factor beta 2 [Tgf-β2]), stem cell markers (Nodal, Lefty, Oct-4, Pax6, Rex1, and Nanog), and differentiation markers (sex determining region Y [Sox2], Brachyury, and alpha fetoprotein [Afp]). These observations suggest that ACCS-M GFP shows the characteristics of CSCs and CSCs may be involved in the EMT of AdCC. Surprisingly, shRNA silencing of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (also a differentiation marker) resulted in downregulation of the EMT and stem cell markers. In addition, sphere-forming ability, EMT characteristics, and tumorigenicity were simultaneously lost. Brachyury expression in clinical samples of AdCC was extremely high and closely related to EMT. This finding suggests that regulation of EMT by Brachyury in clinical AdCC may parallel that observed in vitro in this study.</str>
      <str>The use of a single cell line is a limitation of this study. However, parallel data from in vitro and clinical samples suggest the possibility that EMT is directly linked to CSCs and that Brachyury is a regulator of EMT and CSCs.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumor that recapitulates the notochord phenotype and is thought to derive from notochord remnants not correctly regressed during development. Apoptosis is necessary for the proper notochord development in vertebrates, and the apoptotic pathway mediated by Fas and Fasl has been demonstrated to be involved in notochord cells regression. This study was conducted to investigate the expression of FAS/FASL pathway in a cohort of skull base chordomas and to analyze the role of fas/fasl homologs in zebrafish notochord formation. FAS/FASL expression was found to be dysregulated in chordoma leading to inactivation of the downstream Caspases in the samples analyzed. Both fas and fasl were specifically expressed in zebrafish notochord sorted cells. fas and fasl loss-of-function mainly resulted in larvae with notochord multi-cell-layer jumps organization, larger vacuolated notochord cells, defects in the peri-notochordal sheath structure and in vertebral mineralization. Interestingly, we observed the persistent expression of ntla and col2a1a, the zebrafish homologs of the human T gene and COL2A1 respectively, which are specifically up-regulated in chordoma. These results demonstrate for the first time the dysregulation of FAS/FASL in chordoma and their role in notochord formation in the zebrafish model, suggesting their possible implication in chordoma onset.</str>

      <str>To gain insights into coordinated lineage-specification and morphogenetic processes during early embryogenesis, here we report a systematic identification of transcriptional programs mediated by a key developmental regulator--Brachyury. High-resolution chromosomal localization mapping of Brachyury by ChIP sequencing and ChIP-exonuclease revealed distinct sequence signatures enriched in Brachyury-bound enhancers. A combination of genome-wide in vitro and in vivo perturbation analysis and cross-species evolutionary comparison unveiled a detailed Brachyury-dependent gene-regulatory network that directly links the function of Brachyury to diverse developmental pathways and cellular housekeeping programs. We also show that Brachyury functions primarily as a transcriptional activator genome-wide and that an unexpected gene-regulatory feedback loop consisting of Brachyury, Foxa2, and Sox17 directs proper stem-cell lineage commitment during streak formation. Target gene and mRNA-sequencing correlation analysis of the T(c) mouse model supports a crucial role of Brachyury in up-regulating multiple key hematopoietic and muscle-fate regulators. Our results thus chart a comprehensive map of the Brachyury-mediated gene-regulatory network and how it influences in vivo developmental homeostasis and coordination.</str>

      <str>Sacral chordoma is an aggressive bone tumor with a high local recurrence rate. Surgery remains the standard treatment because of its resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, recurrence occurs frequently even after complete surgical resection. Great effort has been invested in discovering novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To date, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in 42 sacral chordoma samples and 16 distant normal tissue specimens by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, we analyzed its association with the clinical factors and patients' prognosis. Of all the chordoma samples, 69 % (29/42) showed high expression of SPHK1, whereas, only 19 % (3/16) of distant normal tissues expressed a high level of SPHK1 (p = 0.001). Chi-square analysis revealed that high expression of SPHK1 was significantly correlated with tumor recurrence (p = 0.019) and invasion into surrounding muscle (p = 0.005), while the data did not indicate any association with patients' gender, age, tumor location and size (p &gt; 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test showed that patients with high expression of SPHK1 possessed shorter continuous disease-free survival time. Conclusively, SPHK1 may become a potential biomarker for sacral chordoma in predicting its recurrence and patients' prognosis.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, slow-growing, primary malignant skeletal neoplasms. Chromosome analysis, telomere reduction and telomere activity, DNA microsatellite, and loss of heterozygosity studies have been performed on chordomas; however, the clonality status (monoclonal versus polyclonal proliferation) is unknown. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether sacral chordoma is monoclonal or polyclonal in origin with the use of a polymorphic X-linked gene (AR; alias HUMARA) and X-chromosome inactivation studies. DNA was harvested from tumor and corresponding normal tissue from eight women (37-71 years) with chordoma. Clonality was determined using an X chromosome inactivation protocol and a polymorphic human androgen receptor gene (AR) located on the X chromosome. The procedure required a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and determination of the ratio of active to inactive X chromosomes. Results were informative for seven of the eight women, with two separate X-linked alleles seen for the AR gene in the normal tissue. Expression of AR gene alleles from each of the two X chromosomes was present in the chordoma tumor, indicating a polyclonal proliferation in all seven women. Most solid tumors and skeletal neoplasms are polyclonal in nature. Our study indicates that chordoma is polyclonal in its pattern of proliferation.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are tumors that arise at vertebral bodies and the base of the skull. Although rare in incidence, they are deadly owing to slow growth and a lack of effective therapeutic options. In this study, we addressed the need for chordoma cell systems that can be used to identify therapeutic targets and empower testing of candidate pharmacologic drugs. Eight human chordoma cell lines that we established exhibited cytology, genomics, mRNA, and protein profiles that were characteristic of primary chordomas. Candidate responder profiles were identified through an immunohistochemical analysis of a chordoma tissue bank of 43 patients. Genomic, mRNA, and protein expression analyses confirmed that the new cell systems were highly representative of chordoma tissues. Notably, all cells exhibited a loss of CDKN2A and p16, resulting in universal activation of the CDK4/6 and Rb pathways. Therefore, we investigated the CDK4/6 pathway and responses to the CDK4/6-specific inhibitor palbociclib. In the newly validated system, palbociclib treatment efficiently inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and a drug responder versus nonresponder molecular signature was defined on the basis of immunohistochemical expression of CDK4/6/pRb (S780). Overall, our work offers a valuable new tool for chordoma studies including the development of novel biomarkers and molecular targeting strategies. Cancer Res; 75(18); 3823-31. ©2015 AACR. </str>

      <str>Chordomas represent rare malignant primary bone tumors most often occurring in the sacral area. These tumors uncommonly involve the skin and often follow a progressive course with multiple recurrences, metastases and eventual death. Reports of cutaneous metastases from chordoma are very rare. The immunohistochemical staining characteristics of these cutaneous metastases with comparison to the primary tumors are similarly rarely addressed in the literature. We report a rare case of incidentally discovered, small, solitary distant cutaneous metastasis of sacral chordoma that developed on the right upper back of a 44-year-old man with a history of multiple completely excised melanomas who had also been previously diagnosed with chordoma involving the sacrum 12 years earlier. We describe its pathologic features with comparison to the primary tumor and briefly review the literature. Immunohistochemically, the cutaneous metastasis and primary tumor both stained positively for pancytokeratin and vimentin, as expected. However, the cutaneous metastasis unexpectedly lacked S100 protein expression, whereas the primary tumor was S100 positive. This phenomenon has only been documented in one other case report. We demonstrate that late, incidentally discovered cutaneous metastasis with unexpected immunohistochemical staining features rarely occur and can present a diagnostic challenge.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are tumors of notochordal differentiation of low to intermediate grade malignancy. These tumors are typically slow growing, with an indolent but progressive clinical course. We present a case of a highly proliferative chordoma arising in a 73-year-old woman with unusually rapid clinical growth and aggressive histologic and immunohistochemical features. This patient had an unusually brief preclinical course and within 1 month of developing headaches presented to medical attention with diplopia. The resected chordoma showed uncommonly elevated mitotic activity, without the histologic hallmarks of de-differentiation. This proliferative activity correlated with elevated Ki67 staining (60%), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma1 (BCL1) expression (100%), and topoisomerase IIα staining (&gt;95%). E-cadherin expression was also lost throughout the majority of the tumor. Other markers of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) including vimentin, N-cadherin, Slug and Twist, were also strongly expressed in this aggressive tumor. The sellar component of the tumor recurred within a 2-month interval. The evaluation of the additional biomarkers, including makers of EMT studied in this, case may allow for identification of aggressive chordomas in which the tempo of disease is significantly more rapid than in typical cases of chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant tumors that are postulated to arise from remnants of the notochord. Currently, the interaction between chordomas and the host immune system is poorly understood. The checkpoint protein, PD-1 is expressed by circulating lymphocytes and is a marker of activation and exhaustion. Its ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273), are expressed on a variety of human cancers; however this pathway has not been previously reported in chordomas. We used flow cytometric and RT-PCR analysis in three established primary and recurrent chordoma cell lines (U-CH1, U-CH2, and JHC7) as well as immunohistochemical analysis of chordoma tissues from 10 patients to identify and localize expression of PD-1 pathway proteins. PD-1 ligands are not constitutively expressed by chordoma cells, but their expression is induced in the setting of pro-inflammatory cytokines in all cell lines examined. In paraffin embedded tissues, we found that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expressed PD-1 in 3/6 cases. We also found that, although chordoma cells did not express significant levels of PD-L1, PD-L1 expression was observed on tumor-infiltrating macrophages and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Our study suggests that PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 are present in the microenvironment of a subset of chordomas analyzed. Future studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of the PD-1 pathway to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of chordomas. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, locally aggressive malignancies that often exhibit an insidious natural history and are difficult to eradicate. Surgery and radiotherapy are the treatment mainstays of chordoma, but the chance of local recurrence remains high. Reports of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression in chordoma suggest that these tumors may respond to kinase inhibitor therapy. Currently, there are no effective chemotherapeutic protocols for chordoma. A tissue microarray containing 74 tumor specimens from primary chordoma patients and 71 from their recurrent tumors for a total of 145 tumor specimens was immunohistochemically analyzed for expression of a number of proteins involved in signal transduction from RTKs. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Met, and CD-34 were detected in 100, 92, 100, and 59 % of cases, respectively. PDGFR-α and c-Met staining was of moderate to strong intensity in all cases. In contrast, total EGFR staining was variable; weak staining was detected in 10 cases. Our results contribute to the understanding of the expression of RTKs in skull base chordomas and support the development of targeted therapies that inhibit RTKs, which may have a synergistic effect for chemotherapy in patients. There were statistically significant correlations between the expression of PDGFR-α, c-Met, and EGFR and disease-free survival. The results nonetheless suggest that chordomas may respond to RTK inhibitors or modulators of other downstream signaling. </str>

Herein, we present a rare case of a mixed tumor/myoepithelioma arising in the iliac bone of a young adult male who presented with swelling in his right hip. Radiological imaging disclosed a large, intraosseous, lytic, heterogenous mass with a soft tissue component. Biopsy and subsequent tumor resection showed an 18cm sized tumor involving the iliac bone and soft tissues and comprising polygonal and spindly cells, arranged in cords and aggregates, embedded in a myxohyaline stroma with osteochondroid differentiation. Tumor cells exhibited mild nuclear variation, rare mitotic figures, focal cytoplasmic clearing, and prominent squamous differentiation. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor cells were diffusely positive for S100-P, EMA, CK5/6, p63, GFAP, calponin, and focally positive for CK/MNF116, but negative for Brachyury/T. Diagnosis of a myoepithelioma/mixed tumor was offered. Further, cytogenetic analysis revealed lack of EWSR1 gene rearrangement and showed clonal trisomies of 11, 15, 17 with del (16q) and del (22q11). The present case is a rare documentation of a myoepithelioma in the appendicular bones and the second such case identified in the iliac bone.

      <str>Brachyury is required for the normal extension of the anteroposterior axis during mouse embryogenesis. A transgene comprising sequences from -500 to +150 relative to the start of Brachyury transcription, and the reporter gene lacZ, recapitulates some, but not all elements of Brachyury expression. Beta-Galactosidase expression is seen in the primitive streak from 6.5 d.p.c. but there is no detectable reporter expression in the node or notochord. Thus, the regulatory sequences required for the expression of Brachyury in the cells traversing the primitive streak are distinct from those required for the initiation of expression in the node. This suggests that different or additional signals are involved in activation of Brachyury in the node and notochord than those inducing Brachyury in the primitive streak. Additionally, the data suggest the possibility that axial and non-axial mesoderm are distinct from the earliest stages of Brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a transcription factor that functions in gastrulation and endoderm development throughout the Bilateria. Here, we identify genes that are expressed downstream of brachyury during gastrulation of the sea urchin embryo. Screens with two different complex probes generated by subtractive hybridization were carried out on high-density arrays of embryonic cDNA libraries. An mRNA sequence population from embryos expressing brachyury at its peak stage of expression was subtracted with message sequence from embryos in which Brachyury function had been "knocked-out" by injection of a morpholine-substituted antisense oligonucleotide to generate a differential probe for brachyury target genes. Another probe was made by using an mRNA population from embryos that mis-express brachyury at a stage just prior to the normal onset of expression, subtracted with message sequence taken from normal embryos at this stage. Screens carried out with these probes target overlapping but distinct sets of downstream genes. After partial sequence characterization, promising genes were independently analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and by in situ hybridization. Two major classes of genes emerge in this study: genes expressed in the subset of the secondary mesenchyme cells (SMC) that will become pigment cells, and genes that are expressed in portions of the endoderm coincident with brachyury expression. The latter genes are candidates for direct transcriptional targets of Brachyury. Some of the endodermal genes that respond to Brachyury are cytoskeletal modulators that may play a role in gut morphogenesis. This finding is consistent with the block in gastrulation induced by interfering with Brachyury function in sea urchins, and with known or suggested Brachyury function in other species. Other endodermal target genes are expressed in the archenteron and might be terminal differentiation enzymes of the gut. Brachyury expression patterns for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus reported in this paper are entirely consistent with data from other echinoderm species. Brachyury expression in the vegetal plate is confined to the presumptive endodermal cells. Therefore, the SMC genes are likely to be indirect targets of Brachyury-induced signaling from the surrounding endoderm to the central mesoderm, or the effects on these genes may be indirect consequences of gross disruption of the vegetal plate. These results and other data suggest that the brachyury gene transduces information about the state of endodermal specification to genes that modulate morphogenesis and genes that perform terminal functions in the gut.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor Brachyury is expressed in a number of tumour types and has been demonstrated to have cancer inducing properties. To date, it has been linked to cancer associated induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tumour metastasis and expression of markers for cancer stem-like cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that Brachyury plays an important role in the progression of cancer, although the mechanism through which it functions is poorly understood. Here we show that Brachyury regulates the potential of Brachyury-positive colorectal cancer cells to proliferate and reduced levels of Brachyury result in inhibition of proliferation, with features consistent with the cells entering a quiescent-like state. This inhibition of proliferation is dependent upon p27Kip1 demonstrating that Brachyury acts to modulate cellular proliferative fate in colorectal cancer cells in a p27Kip1-dependent manner. Analysis of patient derived colorectal tumours reveals a heterogeneous localisation of Brachyury (in the nucleolus, nucleus and cytoplasm) indicating the potential complexity of the regulatory role of Brachyury in solid colorectal tumours. </str>

The 5- and 10-year OS of the entire series of patients was 78.6 and 30 %, respectively. There were five primary chordomas (12.5 %) with moderate and 35 (87.5 %) with strong expression of VEGFR-2. All recurrent spinal chordomas displayed strong expression of VEGFR-2. The expression of iNOS was predominately moderate to high in primary chordomas: There were 15 tumors (37.5 %) with moderate and 25 tumors (62.5 %) with strong expression.

      <str>Sacral chordoma is a vessel-rich and infiltrative tumor, but the fundamental knowledge of its biological behavior remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the expression levels and contributions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the angiogenesis and recurrence of sacral chordoma and their correlations. An immunohistochemical method was used to investigate the expression of VEGF, MMP-9, and microvascular density (MVD) in 36 patients with sacral chordoma. Their differences in expressions were statistically analyzed and their correlations with angiogenesis and recurrence were evaluated. The mean MVD of sacral chordomas was significantly higher than that of the adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.033). Immunoreactivity for VEGF and MMP-9 was significantly higher in sacral chordoma tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.008, P = 0.005). The mean MVD of VEGF and MMP-9 were statistically higher in positive group than in negative group (P = 0.015, P = 0.004), respectively . Moreover, a significant correlation was found between the VEGF and MMP-9 (P = 0.002). The log-rank test revealed that continuous disease-free survival time (CDFS) was significantly shorter in the MMP-9-positive group than in the MMP-9-negative group (P = 0.019), but the difference in the VEGF-positive group and the VEGF-negative group was not statistically significant (P = 0.938). Our data suggest that VEGF and MMP-9 might act with a synergistic effect and can positively regulate the angiogenesis in sacral chordoma. Positive expression of MMP-9 might indicate the local recurrence of sacral chordoma. The result suggests that some specific drugs which inhibit VEGF, MMP-9, or their receptors may have a good therapeutic effect for sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chordomas mainly arise along the axial skeleton and are characterized by their slow but destructive growth. Prognosis and quality of life are poor because treatment options are mainly limited to surgery and radiotherapy. Survivin, a member of the apoptosis inhibitor protein family, functions as a key regulator of mitosis and programmed cell death, and is overexpressed in many tumor types. The aim of this study was to determine the role of survivin in chordomas. Survivin expression was investigated in 50 chordoma samples and three chordoma cell lines using immunohistochemistry. The intensity of immunostaining was evaluated in regard to the development of recurrences. The immunohistochemical results were correlated with clinical parameters like gender, age, tumor size, and location and were performed in primary chordomas as well as in recurrent lesions. Furthermore, survivin knockdown experiments on chordoma cell lines were performed. YM155 decreased the growth behavior of chordoma cells dose- and time dependently. Transient knockdown of survivin led to a G2/M arrest, decreased proliferation, consistently induced an increase of polyploidy and morphological changes, and induced apoptosis. The resultant data from this study suggest that survivin plays a cell cycle-progressive role in chordomas. Hence, regulation of survivin by YM155 is a promising new target for the development of new therapeutic drugs. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      <str>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is believed to originate from notochordal remnants. We previously identified germline T duplication as a major susceptibility mechanism in several chordoma families. Recently, a common genetic variant in T (rs2305089) was significantly associated with the risk of sporadic chordoma. We sequenced all T exons in 24 familial cases and 54 unaffected family members from eight chordoma families (three with T duplications), 103 sporadic cases, and 160 unrelated controls. We also measured T copy number variation in all sporadic cases. We confirmed the association between the previously reported variant rs2305089 and risk of familial [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93, 7.25, P = 0.067] and sporadic chordoma (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.89, 4.29, P &lt; 0.0001). We also identified a second common variant, rs1056048, that was strongly associated with chordoma in families (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 1.43, 11.92, P = 0.0086). Among sporadic cases, another common variant (rs3816300) was significantly associated with risk when jointly analyzed with rs2305089. The association with rs3816300 was significantly stronger in cases with early age onset. In addition, we identified three rare variants that were only observed among sporadic chordoma cases, all of which have potential functional relevance based on in silico predictions. Finally, we did not observe T duplication in any sporadic chordoma case. Our findings further highlight the importance of the T gene in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic chordoma and suggest a complex susceptibility related to T.</str>

      <str>Intralesional fibrous septum (IFS) generally is considered a reactive tissue in chordoma; however, little is known about its significance. We studied 122 chordomas for IFS using immunohistochemical techniques and compared IFS and lobular growth patterns (LGPs) formed by IFS with clinicopathologic parameters. Seventy-nine tumors (64.8%) revealed IFS. However, IFS frequently was infiltrated and interrupted by tumor cells with increased expression of proteases; only 33 (42%) of 79 tumors had LGP. In non-skull base chordomas, IFS and LGP were associated with nuclear pleomorphism, a previously described prognostic indicator, mitosis, and the MIB-1 labeling index, indicating a role of IFS and LGP in tumor growth or progression. Paradoxically, patients without LGP tended to have a worse prognosis than those with LGP. We believe that IFS exerts diverse influences on chordoma; however, invasion of IFS leading to loss of the LGP indicates advanced stages of tumor development, possibly predicting an unfavorable prognosis in chordoma.</str>

      <str>Mature cystic teratoma of the ovary (MCTO) is the most common type of ovarian teratoma and also the most frequent tumor originating from germ cells. It is usually diagnosed in early adulthood and, by definition, is composed of well-differentiated tissues, which originate from all three germ cell layers. Unusual types of tissues can be found in MCTO, such as kidney, adrenal, and prostatic tissues. Malignant transformation is reported in less than 2% of teratomas. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy arising in these otherwise benign tumors. We present the first case of MCTO containing a chordoma. The chordoma differentiation was supported by immunohistochemical staining and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (IP-FISH) technique showing 19% of the nuclei of the MCTO displaying polysomy for the chromosome X, while 28% of the chordoma nuclei showed chromosome 7 mosaicism. These results are concordant with previous studies, showing chromosomal anomalies in chromosomes X and 7 in MCTO and chordomas, respectively.</str>

      <str>Widespread expression of the DNA-binding protein Brachyury in Xenopus animal caps causes ectopic mesoderm formation. In this paper, we first show that two types of mesoderm are induced by different concentrations of Brachyury. Animal pole explants from embryos injected with low doses of Xbra RNA differentiate into vesicles containing mesothelial smooth muscle and mesenchyme. At higher concentrations somitic muscle is formed. The transition from smooth muscle formation to that of somitic muscle occurs over a two-fold increase in Brachyury concentration. Brachyury is required for differentiation of notochord in mouse and fish embryos, but even the highest concentrations of Brachyury do not induce this tissue in Xenopus animal caps. Co-expression of Brachyury with the secreted glycoprotein noggin does cause notochord formation, but it is difficult to understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon without knowing more about the noggin signal transduction pathway. To overcome this difficulty, we have now tested mesoderm-specific transcription factors for the ability to synergize with Brachyury. We find that co-expression of Pintallavis, but not goosecoid, with Brachyury causes formation of dorsal mesoderm, including notochord. Furthermore, the effect of Pintallavis, like that of Brachyury, is dose-dependent: a two-fold increase in Pintallavis RNA causes a transition from ventral mesoderm formation to that of muscle, and a further two-fold increase induces notochord and neural tissue. These results suggest that Pintallavis cooperates with Brachyury to pattern the mesoderm in Xenopus.</str>

Loss-of-function studies of mouse Brachyury and the zebrafish Brachyury ortholog Ntl indicated that Brachyury plays a more significant role in higher vertebrates than lower vertebrates. We have identified a second zebrafish Brachyury ortholog (Bra), and show that a combined loss of Ntl and Bra recapitulates the mouse phenotype, demonstrating an ancient role for Brachyury in patterning all but the most anterior somites. Using cell transplantation, we show that the only essential role for Brachyury during somite formation is non-cell autonomous, and demonstrate that Ntl and Bra are required for and can induce expression of the canonical Wnts wnt8 and wnt3a.

The sequence up to -267 bp relative to the transcription start site was sufficient to enhance reporter gene expression depending on the mesodermal differentiation of P19 cells. Footprint analysis by nuclear extract showed binding of a GATA protein and SP4 and mutation of their sites reduced reporter gene expression. Gel-retardation assay in the presence of a series of double-stranded DNA fragments as the competitors showed SP1 and Est sites additionally. Deletion of either sites reduced the reporter gene expression, showing that they are cooperative. Depletion of PEA3 (a transcription factor of the Est family) with a specific antibody diminished the retarded bands only for the nuclear extract from differentiated P19 cells.

      <str>The transcription factor brachyury is a major driver of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human carcinoma cells. It is overexpressed in several human tumor types versus normal adult tissues, except for testes and thyroid. Overexpression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. Previous studies identified a brachyury HLA-A2 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope. The studies reported here describe an enhancer epitope of brachyury. Compared to the native epitope, the agonist epitope: (a) has enhanced binding to MHC class I, (b) increased the IFN-γ production from brachyury-specific T cells, (c) generated brachyury-specific T cells with greater levels of perforin and increased proliferation, (d) generated T cells more proficient at lysing human carcinoma cells endogenously expressing the native epitope, and (e) achieved greater brachyury-specific T-cell responses in vivo in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. These studies also report the generation of a heat-killed recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) vector expressing the full-length brachyury gene encoding the agonist epitope. Compared to yeast-brachyury (native) devoid of the agonist epitope, the yeast-brachyury (agonist) enhanced the activation of brachyury-specific T cells, which efficiently lysed human carcinoma cells. In addition to providing the rationale for the recombinant yeast-brachyury (agonist) as a potential vaccine in cancer therapy, these studies also provide the rationale for the use of the agonist in (a) dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, (b) adjuvant or liposomal vaccines, (c) recombinant viral and/or bacterial vaccines, (d) protein/polypeptide vaccines, (e) activation of T cells ex vivo in adoptive therapy protocols, and (f) generation of genetically engineered targeted T cells. </str>

      <str>Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to play a crucial role in bone formation in vivo. We sought to determine the temporal effect of NO on murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) under culture conditions that promote osteogenesis. Expression profiles of NO pathway members and osteoblast-specific markers were analyzed using appropriate assays. We found that NO was supportive of osteogenesis specifically during an early phase of in vitro development (days 3-5). Furthermore, ESCs stably overexpressing the inducible NO synthase showed accelerated and enhanced osteogenesis in vitro and in bone explant cultures. To determine the role of NO in early lineage commitment, a stage in ESC differentiation equivalent to primitive streak formation in vivo, ESCs were transfected with a T-brachyury-GFP reporter. Expression levels of T-brachyury and one of its upstream regulators, β-catenin, the major effector in the canonical Wnt pathway, were responsive to NO levels in differentiating primitive streak-like cells. Our results indicate that NO may be involved in early differentiation through regulation of β-catenin and T-brachyury, controlling the specification of primitive-streak-like cells, which may continue through differentiation to later become osteoblasts.</str>

      <str>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β1 is one of well-recognized factors contributing to renal fibrosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of EMT are not fully understood. Brachyury, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, was recently identified as an important factor promoting EMT in human carcinoma cell lines. There is no evidence that Brachyury is involved in renal tubular EMT.</str>
      <str>Our results demonstrated that Brachyury was prominently induced in TGF-β1-treated human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells and that this induction was accompanied by changes characteristic of EMT. Blockage of Brachyury expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in HK-2 cells effectively reversed the TGF-β1-induced EMT phenotype. Brachyury induction repressed E-cadherin transcription; the E-cadherin promoter contains a Brachyury binding site, and decreased expression of E-cadherin occurred in Brachyury-overexpressing cells when they were transfected with reporter constructs using the promoter. This effect was partially mediated by Slug and Snail, as knockdown of Snail and Slug by siRNA effectively reversed Brachyury-mediated EMT and partially restored E-cadherin expression. The expression of Brachyury also presented in a rat model of obstructive nephropathy and in tubulointerstitial fibrosis tissues of IgA nephropathy, suggesting that it may have a role in EMT and renal fibrosis in vivo.</str>

This tumor shares many of the clinical and histologic features of classic chordoma and chondrosarcoma and has been shown to have a better prognosis than either of these lesions. To the best of our knowledge, no ultrastructural studies have been performed in the 26 cases of chondroid chordoma published previously. We document the ultrastructural features of two examples of chondroid chordoma. Certain features such as prominent and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, intracytoplasmic glycogen aggregates, and abundant fibrillogranular matrix are common to chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and chondroid chordoma. The presence of well-formed tonofilament desmosome complexes as well as complexes composed of alternating profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were seen only in chordoma and chondroid chordoma, but not in cartilaginous tumors. Of particular interest was the finding of crystalline, tubular structures within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of both cases of chondroid chordoma, a finding not described previously. The distinction of chondroid chordoma from classical chordoma is said to be a difficult one at the light-microscopic level, and we suggest that these intraergastoplasmic tubular structures might constitute an extremely helpful differential marker.</str>

Proton beam therapy is not always effective enough to eradicate the tumour. Additional modes of therapy are needed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate EGFR expression and EGFR gene status of chordoma. Twenty-one cases of chordoma were retrieved from the in-house and consultation files of the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-EGFR antibody and FISH was performed on slides obtained from representative archival paraffin blocks. In our study 81% of cases of chordoma showed low to high EGFR expression in immunohistochemistry. In six cases (26.6%) the FISH results for EGFR were classified as positive (an average EGFR copy number &gt; or = 4 per cell). There was one case of chromosome 7 aneuploidy reported.</str>

      <str>Primary soft tissue myoepithelial tumours (METs) are rare. Recent studies have shown EWSR1 rearrangement in certain METs. We present clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of 14 primary soft tissue METs. Fourteen tumours, five benign and nine malignant, occurred in 12 men and two women, with an age range of 18-60 years (mean, 39.2); in upper extremities, four (29 %); chest wall, three (21 %); paraspinal region, three (21 %); pelvis, two (14 %) and lower extremities, two (14 %). Tumour size varied from 2 to 21.6 cm (mean, 8.7). Microscopically, most tumours were at least focally circumscribed. Morphological heterogeneity was noted, commonest patterns being cord-like and diffuse arrangement of polygonal cells in a myxoid stroma. By immunohistochemistry, tumours were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) (10/12, 83 %), cytokeratin (CK)/MNF116 (3/12, 25 %), p63 (7/10, 70 %), CD10 (4/6, 67 %), calponin (6/6, 100 %), S-100P (11/13, 85 %), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (6/12, 50 %), smooth muscle actin (SMA) (3/9, 33 %), INI1/SMARCB1 (6/10, 60 %), brachyury (0/11), CD34 (0/5) and vimentin (4/4, 100 %), implying 93 % positivity for at least one epithelial marker. EWSR1 gene rearrangement was detected in 3/6 (50 %) METs (one benign and two malignant) and in an eccrine porocarcinoma which was included for reasons of comparison. Outcome details were available for six patients all surgically treated; three tumours (two malignant and one benign) resected with unknown marginal status recurred; two patients died and a single patient with myoepithelial carcinoma, who underwent a wide excision, is disease-free. This study illustrates the wide morphological spectrum of soft tissue METs, including benign and malignant subtypes. EMA and S-100P are optimal markers that should be supplemented with broad spectrum keratins, such as AE1/AE3, along with p63, GFAP and calponin in case of need but the results must be correlated with morphological features. Brachyury is useful in separating parachordoma/myoepithelioma from chordoma. EWSR1 rearrangement mostly occurs in METs that are deep-seated, irrespective of benign or malignant behaviour. Most malignant METs are INI1 negative.</str>

      <str>In vertebrates, Brachyury, a T-box transcription factor gene, seems to have a dual role in the differentiation of axial midline mesoderm cells into notochord and gastrulation cell movements regulated by non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling. To understand the function of Brachyury-downstream genes in chordate embryos, from a series of our survey on differential expression, including subtractive hybridization, dot-blot assays, EST sequences and the expression patterns in whole-mount in situ hybridization at embryonic stages, we developed a knowledge database called "CINOBI: CionaNotochord and Brachyury-downstream gene Index" to create comprehensive catalogues of Brachyury-downstream gene sets in Ciona intestinalis. Combining genome and large-scale cDNA data, we were able to characterize 450 non-redundant Brachyury-downstream genes: Twenty-four genes were newly annotated as notochord-expressed genes. Several genes are components of signaling pathways such as Wnt/PCP, Nf kappaB and TGF-beta signaling. We propose that Brachyury is linked to these pathways regulating the expression of each component, and such a regulatory mechanism might be conserved among chordates.</str>

      <str>We investigated the functional role of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in regulating cardiomyogenesis using mouse P19CL6 embryonic carcinoma cells. ECP was confirmed to accelerate the cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19CL6 cells by enhancing the rate and area size of beating of cardiomyocyte and by facilitating the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific genes, such as GATA4 and α-MHC. Since cardiomyocyte differentiation in vivo is considered to follow mesoderm induction, the induction of Brachyury, a marker of mesoderm, was assessed. Brachyury expression was found to be enhanced after the addition of ECP. This enhancement was due to the stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation by ECP. In this context, treatment with SU5402, an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1, suppressed Brachyury expression, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and cardiomyocyte differentiation induced by ECP. We concluded that ECP might induce mesoderm differentiation through FGF signaling pathway and enhance subsequent cardiomyocyte differentiation in concert with dimethyl sulfoxide in P19CL6 cells. ECP may be a novel factor for cardiomyocyte differentiation, which should be very useful to prepare adequate numbers of cardiomyocytes for therapeutic cell transplantation.</str>

      <str>The miRNA microarray assay revealed miR-155 to be highly expressed and biologically active in chordoma. miR-155 expression in chordoma tissues was significantly elevated, and this expression correlated significantly with disease stage (p = 0.036) and the presence of metastasis (p = 0.035). miR-155 expression also correlated significantly with poor outcomes for chordoma patients (hazard ratio, 5.32; p = 0.045).

      <str>Chordomas are rare, malignant bone neoplasms in which the pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown. Interestingly, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is the only syndrome in which the incidence of chordomas has been described. We previously reported the pathogenic role of the TSC genes in TSC-associated chordomas. In this study, we investigated whether aberrant TSC/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is associated with sporadic chordomas.</str>
      <str>We assessed the status of mTORC1 signaling in primary tumors/cell lines of sacral chordomas and further examined upstream of mTORC1 signaling, including the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) tumor suppressor. We also tested the efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on signaling and growth of chordoma cell lines.</str>
      <str>Sporadic sacral chordoma tumors and cell lines examined commonly displayed hyperactivated Akt and mTORC1 signaling. Strikingly, expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling, was not detected or significantly reduced in chordoma-derived cell lines and primary tumors. Furthermore, rapamycin inhibited mTORC1 activation and suppressed proliferation of chordoma-derived cell line.</str>
      <str>Our results suggest that loss of PTEN as well as other genetic alterations that result in constitutive activation of Akt/mTORC1 signaling may contribute to the development of sporadic chordomas.

      <str>Chordomas are locally destructive tumors with high rates of recurrence and a poor prognosis. The mechanisms involved in chordoma recurrence remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the proteomic profile of a chordoma primary tumor (CSO) and a recurrent tumor (CSR) through mass spectrum in a chordoma patient who underwent surgery. Bioinformatic analysis of the profile showed that 359 proteins had a significant expression difference and 21 pathways had a striking alteration between the CSO and the CSR. The CSR showed a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed that the cancer stem cell marker activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM or CD166) expression level was higher in the recurrent than that in the primary tumor. The present study analyzed the proteomic profile change between CSO and CSR and identified a new biomarker ALCAM in recurrent chordomas. This finding sheds light on unraveling the pathophysiology of chordoma recurrence and on exploring more effective prognostic biomarkers and targeted therapies against this devastating disease.</str>

      <str>Formation of the early vertebrate embryo depends on a Brachyury/Wnt autoregulatory loop within the posterior mesodermal progenitors. We show that exogenous retinoic acid (RA), which dramatically truncates the embryo, represses expression of the zebrafish brachyury ortholog no tail (ntl), causing a failure to sustain the loop. We found that Ntl functions normally to protect the autoregulatory loop from endogenous RA by directly activating cyp26a1 expression. Thus, the embryonic mesodermal progenitors uniquely establish their own niche--with Brachyury being essential for creating a domain of high Wnt and low RA signaling--rather than having a niche created by separate support cells.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a member of the T-box transcription family, has been suggested to be essential for morphogenetic movements in various processes of animal development. However, little is known about its critical transcriptional targets. In order to identify targets of Brachyury and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying morphogenetic movements, we first searched the genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis, the only amphibian genomic sequence available, for Brachyury-binding sequences known as T-half sites, and then screened for the ones conserved between vertebrate genomes. We found three genes that have evolutionarily conserved T-half sites in the promoter regions and examined these genes experimentally to determine whether their expressions were regulated by Brachyury, using the animal cap system of Xenopus laevis embryos. Eventually, we obtained evidence that vimentin, encoding an intermediate filament protein, was a potential target of Brachyury. This is the first report to demonstrate that Brachyury might affect the cytoskeletal structure through regulating the expression of an intermediate filament protein, vimentin.</str>

This study investigates histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as potential therapeutics for chordomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the HDAC 1-6 antibodies on 50 chordoma samples (34 primary tumors, 16 recurrences) from 44 patients (27 male, 17 female). Pan-HDAC-inhibitors Vorinostat (SAHA), Panobinostat (LBH-589), and Belinostat (PXD101) were tested for their efficacy in the chordoma cell line MUG-Chor1 via Western blot, cell cycle analysis, caspase 3/7 activity (MUG-Chor1, UCh-1), cleaved caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. p-Values below 0.05 were considered significant. IHC was negative for HDAC1, positive for HDAC2 in most (n = 36; 72%), and for HDACs 3-6 in all specimens available (n = 43; 86%). HDAC6 expression was strongest. SAHA and LBH-589, but not PXD101 caused a significant increase of G2/M phase cells and of cleaved caspase-3 (p = 0.0003, and p = 0.0014 after 72 h, respectively), and a peak of caspase 3/7 activity. PARP cleavage confirmed apoptosis. The presented chordoma series expressed HDACs 2-6 with strongest expression of HDAC6.

Using immunohistochemical techniques, we investigated the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-1, -2, and -9; tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs)-1 and -2; cathepsin B (CatB); urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA); and plasminogen activator inhibitor, type I (PAI1), in 45 patients with skull base chordoma (45 primary and 25 autologous recurrent lesions). We compared these data with clinicopathologic parameters and the expression of cell differentiation markers. MMP-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1, CatB, uPA, and PAI1 were frequently expressed, and there was a significant correlation in the expression of some proteinases. Immunoreactivity for MMP-1, MMP-2, CatB, and uPA was significantly higher in lesions exhibiting tumor infiltration of host bone than in those without such components. Expression of MMP-1, TIMP-1, CatB, and uPA was associated with that of low-molecular-weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2). There were no differences in proteinase expression in 25 pairs of primary and their recurrent lesions, and proteinase expression did not predict local recurrences. However, patients with higher expression of both MMP-1 and uPA showed worse prognosis compared with the others. In conclusion, expression of some proteinases correlated with CAM5.2 expression and seemed to play an important role in a synergistic manner in the invasion process in skull base chordoma. The authors believe that elevated expression of MMP-1 and uPA can be used to identify patients with a worse prognosis in skull base chordoma.</str>

      <str>It has previously been shown that human beta-microseminoprotein enhances development of mesodermal structures in the chick embryo. The present study was carried out to elucidate the mechanism of action of human beta-microseminoprotein in the chick embryo. beta-Microseminoprotein brought about significant modulation of expression of Brachyury in gastrulating embryos. In approximately 50% of the treated embryos, Brachyury expression was enhanced around the Hensen's node. These cells not only expressed higher levels of Brachyury, but also appeared to switch off Brachyury expression prematurely, postinvagination. The spatial modulation of Brachyury is not clearly reflected in the northern blots, indicating that beta-microseminoprotein treatment results in redistribution of available transcripts or that the upregulation is compensated for by early switching off of Brachyury postinvagination. Because higher levels of Brachyury during gastrulation are believed to result in early exit of cells from the primitive streak, beta-microseminoprotein treatment appeared to have stimulated morphogenetic movements by upregulating Brachyury around the Hensen's node. This deduction was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic analysis that showed that altered morphogenetic movements accompany modulation of Brachyury. The specific responses elicited by beta-microseminoprotein indicate presence of a structurally related molecule in the chick. By western blotting, similar molecules were indeed detected in the chicken seminal plasma and in chick embryos. These data strongly suggest that beta-microseminoprotein-related molecule(s) participates in mesoderm formation in the chick embryo.</str>

      <str>Cranial and cervical chordomas can spread by para- or retropharyngeal extension up to the region of the salivary glands or the jaw and may simulate a tumor of the salivary glands or jaw. In occasional cases, because the tumors often expand slowly, months or years may pass between the first clinical symptoms and diagnosis. Diagnostic problems exist in differentiating these chordomas from pleomorphic adenoma, mucinous carcinoma, or chondrosarcoma. Ten relevant observations of typical cranial and cervical chordomas (Salivary Gland Register Hamburg 1965-1996) were analyzed more closely by pathohistological and immunohistochemical means. The exact diagnosis is based upon the evidence of blown-up, bubble-like ("physaliform") cells which contain mucus drops in a vacuolized cytoplasm and are surrounded by extensive areas of mucoid mucus. The pattern of immunohistochemistry is characterized by the multifold expression of cytokeratin, vimentin, and EMA. The differential diagnosis is discussed with reference to further types of chordoma (chondroid chordoma, dedifferentiated chordoma with spindle cell sarcomatous transformation), chondrosarcoma, pleomorphic adenoma, and mucus-producing carcinoma.</str>

      <str>To report on a prospective, investigator-driven, phase II study on lapatinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive advanced chordoma patients.</str>
      <str>From December 2009 to January 2012, 18 advanced progressing chordoma patients entered this study (median age: 61 years; disease extent: metastatic 72% and locally advanced 28%). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and activation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and/or phospho-arrays, real-time polimerase chain reaction, fluorescence immunostaining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was also carried out. Patients received lapatinib 1500 mg/day (mean dose intensity = 1282 mg/day), until progression or toxicity. The primary study end point was response rate (RR) as per Choi criteria. Secondary end points were RR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and clinical benefit rate (CBR; RECIST complete response + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months).</str>
      <str>All patients were evaluable for response. Six (33.3%) patients had PR and 7 (38.9%) SD, as their best Choi responses, corresponding to RECIST SD in all cases. Median PFS by Choi was 6 [interquartile (IQ) range 3-8] months. Median PFS by RECIST was 8 (IQ range 4-12) months, with a 22% CBR.</str>
      <str>This phase II study showed a modest antitumor activity of lapatinib in chordoma. The clinical exploitation of EGFR targeting in chordoma needs to be further investigated, both clinically and preclinically.

      <str>Brachyury(+) mesodermal cell population with purity over 79% was obtained from differentiating brachyury embryonic stem cells (ESC) generated with brachyury promoter driven enhanced green fluorescent protein and puromycin-N-acetyltransferase. A comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of brachyury(+) cells enriched with puromycin application from 6-day-old embryoid bodies (EBs), 6-day-old control EBs and undifferentiated ESCs led to identification of 1573 uniquely up-regulated and 1549 uniquely down-regulated transcripts in brachyury(+) cells. Furthermore, transcripts up-regulated in brachyury(+) cells have overrepresented the Gene Ontology annotations (cell differentiation, blood vessel morphogenesis, striated muscle development, placenta development and cell motility) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotations (mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and transforming growth factor beta signaling). Transcripts representing Larp2 and Ankrd34b are notably up-regulated in brachyury(+) cells. Knockdown of Larp2 resulted in a significantly down-regulation BMP-2 expression, and knockdown of Ankrd34b resulted in alteration of NF-H, PPARγ and PECAM1 expression. The elucidation of transcriptomic signatures of ESCs-derived brachyury(+) cells will contribute toward defining the genetic and cellular identities of presumptive mesodermal cells. Furthermore, there is a possible involvement of Larp2 in the regulation of the late mesodermal marker BMP-2. Ankrd34b might be a positive regulator of neurogenesis and a negative regulator of adipogenesis. </str>

      <str>The expression of the embryonal and of the differentiational proteins in 12 cases of chordoma and in the notochord of a 4-month-old and a 5-month-old human embryo have been examined immunohistologically by the ABC method using polyclonal antibodies to CEA, AFP, or S-100, and the monoclonal antibody to cytokeratin. It was found that S-100 was expressed in all cases of chordoma and in the notochords examined. CEA and cytokeratin also were found expressed in some cases of chordoma but not in the notochords. These proteins were found expressed more strongly in chordomas without a metastasis than in those with a metastasis. In the metastatic lesions, these proteins were expressed more strongly than in the primary lesions. The antibody to AFP reacted with neither the chordomas nor the notochords tested. These results suggest a possible link between the gene-expression of the tumor cells and the microenvironment in which they are harbored.</str>

      <str>A 71-year-old woman was found to have a solid retroperitoneal mass measuring 7 x 6 cm on a computed tomography scan. The tumor was not connected to the spinal cord or large nerves. It was resected and showed the typical histology of hemangioblastoma, that is, numerous capillaries and stromal cells with focal cytoplasmic vacuolization. Immunohistochemical study revealed that the tumor stromal cells were positive for S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and inhibin-α, supporting the diagnosis. In addition, the tumor cells labeled for carbonic anhydrase IX and brachyury. The diffuse strong carbonic anhydrase IX expression suggested that soft-tissue hemangioblastoma may share with central nervous system hemangioblastoma the tumorigenic mechanism involving the von Hippel-Lindau gene product and hypoxia-inducible factor. The brachyury expression observed in this case, albeit focal and weak, may implicate embryonic hemangioblasts as a potential line of differentiation, as was proposed in central nervous system hemangioblastoma. The patient is well 4 years after the surgery without any recurrence. A review of the literature revealed that soft-tissue hemangioblastoma is typically a solid tumor found in older females and often involves the retroperitoneum/pelvis.</str>

      <str>Three cases of intracranial chordoma: 2 cases of typical chordoma and a case of chondroid chordoma, were reported and the clinico-pathological difference between these two types of chordoma was discussed. It is well known that typical chordoma is composed of physaliferous cells containing various quantities of intracytoplasmic mucin histologically, whereas chondroid chordoma as Heffelfinger reported in 1973 is composed of cellular area with scanty myxoid matrix and Chondroid matrix. Clinical course of the typical chordoma shows recurrence of the tumor within 2 years after surgical removal and radiation therapy in the majority of the cases, and the average survival range is said to be about 4.1 years, while chondroid chordoma takes benign course with average survival of 24.1 years after surgery and radiation therapy. One of our two patients with typical chordoma died from the recurrence two years after surgery and radiation therapy. However, the patients with chondroid chordoma showed no sign of recurrence over 2 years after subtotal removal and radiation. Surgical approach for the removal of the tumor was discussed as well. When the tumor is rather small and located at the upper clival region, transsphenoidal approach may be preferable, otherwise other approach should be chosen. When tumor has forward extension over the clivus, subtemporal approach will be most favorable with wider operative field. Identification of vessels and nerves around the tumor will be readily obtained by this approach.</str>

      <str>The T-Box transcription factor Brachyury plays important roles in the development of all bilateral animals examined so far. In order to understand the ancestral function of Brachyury we cloned NemBra1, a Brachyury homolog from the anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Anthozoa are considered the basal group among the Cnidaria. First NemBra1 expression could be detected at the blastula/gastrula transition and gene activity persists until adulthood of the animals. In situ hybridization shows that NemBra1 expression in gastrulae and early planula larvae is restricted to a circle around the blastopore. When the larvae begin to metamorphose into primary polyps, the expression zone extends into the developing mesenteries. In adult polyps Brachyury expression persists in the mesenteries, but is excluded from the septal filament and the differentiated retractor muscles, which also develop from the mesenteries. We conclude that the ancestral function of Brachyury was in specifying the blastopore and its endodermal derivatives.</str>

      <str>The local invasiveness and occasional rapid growth of chordomas, despite optimal treatment, highlight the need to develop ways to predict their biologic behavior. Alterations in adhesion proteins have been shown to participate in proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in epithelial tumors. We therefore analyzed the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, as well as their cytosolic binding proteins alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, in 51 paraffin archived and 17 cryopreserved chordoma specimens. In the majority of chordomas, E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression was inversely correlated, whereas beta-catenin and gamma-catenin expression was directly correlated. By multivariate analysis, N-cadherin up-regulation correlated with a diminished recurrence-free survival, and E-cadherin down-regulation strongly correlated with increased probabilities of death as determined by the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. There was a 3.28-fold increased probability of having a tumor recurrence and a 10.98-fold increased probability of dying when, respectively, N-cadherin was up-regulated and E-cadherin down-regulated. These results suggest that changes in the relative expression of the cadherin-catenin complex reflect chordoma aggressiveness; and that decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of N-cadherin may underlie the transition from a less to a more aggressive tumor phenotype.</str>

      <str>A rare case of sellar chordoma occurring in a 67-year-old woman who survived for more than 10 years is presented. Clinical signs and symptoms masqueraded as a non-functioning pituitary adenoma with visual disturbance and hypopituitarism. Initial computed tomography (CT) showed an intrasellar mixed dense mass with suprasellar extension, accompanied by non-homogeneous contrast enhancement. Partial removal of the mass was accomplished via right fronto-temporal craniotomy. Histological examination revealed a typical chordoma with no malignancy. After postoperative irradiation, the patient was discharged with clinical improvement. Serial CT and magnetic resonance imaging 8 years after treatment disclosed a regrowth of the intrasellar lesion, which extended to the sphenoid sinus and clivus, accompanied by non-homogeneous contrast enhancement. The patient underwent subtotal removal of the recurrent tumor through a sublabial transsphenoidal approach. Histological examination confirmed the previous diagnosis. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated positive cytoplasmic expression of vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen, keratin and S-100 protein, in contrast with a lack of appearance of carcinoembryonic antigen. After reoperation, she completely recovered and has survived for more than 10 years with good quality of life.</str>

      <str>The prognosis of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is influenced             by the presence of lymph node metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),             a process that involves events that convert adherent epithelial cells into individual             migratory cells that can invade the extracellular matrix, is critical for cancer             progression. Recently, the T-box transcription factor Brachyury was reported to             promote EMT in human carcinoma cell lines. We analyzed the relationship between             EMT (assessed by staining for E-cadherin and Vimentin) and the expression of Brachyury             in association with lymph node metastasis in oral SCC. Oral SCC biopsy specimens             (152 cases) were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of E-cadherin,             Vimentin and Brachyury. Expression of Brachyury was correlated with EMT (p=0.035)             and was significantly associated with lymph node and distant metastasis (p&lt;0.05).             Logistic regression analysis showed that Brachyury and EMT were predictive factors             for lymph node metastasis (odds ratio 4.390 and 5.936, respectively) and that             EMT was a predictive factor for distant metastases (odds ratio 11.786). Our findings             present clinical evidence for an important role of Brachyury in EMT in oral SCC,             and suggest that Brachyury and EMT patterns are useful prognostic markers.</str>

      <str>Echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates are deuterostomes and share a number of developmental features. The Brachyury gene is responsible for formation of the notochord, the most defining feature of chordates, and thus may be a key to understanding the origin and evolution of the chordates. Previous studies have shown that the ascidian Brachyury (As-T and Ci-Bra) is expressed in the notochord and that a sea urchin Brachyury (HpTa) is expressed in the secondary mesenchyme founder cells. A recent study by [Tagawa et al. (1998)], however, revealed that a hemichordate Brachyury (PfBra) is expressed in a novel pattern in an archenteron invagination region and a stomodaeum invagination region in the gastrula. The present study demonstrated that the expression pattern of Brachyury (ApBra) of starfish embryos resembles that of PfBra in hemichordate embryos but not of HpTa in sea urchin embryos. Namely, ApBra is expressed in an archenteron invagination region and a stomodaeum invagination region.</str>

      <str>Approximately 10-45% of primary tumors presented alterations of p53, MDM2, cyclin D1, and pRb proteins; most tumors lacked expression of p16(INK4a) and p27(Kip1). Alterations of p53, MDM2, cyclin D1, and pRb proteins were found to have cooperative effects on both higher proliferative ability (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]) and increased nuclear pleomorphism, a previously described prognostic indicator for patients with chordoma. Multivariate analyses revealed that, among these alterations, p53 overexpression was the only independent factor for higher MIB-1 LI. At the genetic level, mdm2 gene amplification was detected in 15.4% of the lesions but did not correlate with MDM2 overexpression or other clinicopathologic parameters. No p53 mutations were detected in the current series. Survival analysis revealed that p53 overexpression, but no other cell cycle alterations, was associated with a reduced overall survival.</str>

      <str>Understanding the events that led to the emergence of the bilaterians is a daunting task, impaired by the huge evolutionary gap separating us from the pre-Cambrian. During gastrulation, the expression of the transcription factor Brachyury is remarkably well conserved around the blastopore of bilaterians and cnidarians. Only the bilaterian Brachyury proteins, however, share a distinctive N-terminal sequence not found in outgroups such as cnidarians, sponges or placozoans. We now know that, in vertebrates, this N-terminal domain confers specific transcriptional activity, by recruiting Smad1, the first identified co-factor for Brachyury. Smad1 is an effector of the BMP pathway, and has been isolated in bilaterians and cnidarians. Here, I propose that the protein-protein interaction between Brachyury and Smad1 represents an evolutionary novelty of the Urbilateria. The gain of the N-terminal domain might have been selected to spatially modulate the activity of Brachyury, thereby facilitating the establishment of bilateral symmetry during gastrulation movements.</str>

      <str>Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside binding protein. Its expression is quantitatively and qualitatively altered during self-proliferation, malignant transformation, and tumor progression. Galectin-3 is a lectin-related molecule. Lectins are proteins that bind specific carbohydrate structures. Although their precise biologic function is unclear, the general idea is that these molecules operate in modulating cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. Galectins have been implicated in cell growth and differentiation and seem to play a role in malignant transformation and metastasis. Galectin-3 is expressed in primitive notochord. The purpose of the current investigation was to identify an immunohistochemical marker to help distinguish the pathologically overlapping entities of chordoma from myxoid low-grade chondrosarcoma. Twelve of 16 (75%) chordomas stained positive for Galectin-3 whereas only one of 12 low-grade myxoid chondrosarcomas stained positive. Galectin-3 chordoma staining is 75% sensitive and 92% specific.</str>

      <str>Dedifferentiated chordoma, i.e. chordoma with a sarcomatous component, is a rare bone tumor. This case report is of a dedifferentiated chordoma in the sacrococcygeal region in a 50-year-old male. The patient was initially diagnosed as having a leiomyosarcoma at the first medical consultation, but after the tumor recurred it was proven to be a dedifferentiated chordoma. The primary tumor, which measured 7 x 5 cm, was located in front of the sacrum so as to compress the rectum forward. The resected specimen showed histological features of chordoma, but the presence in some parts of the tumor of spindle-shaped epithelial cells led to a misdiagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Thirty-six months later, a local recurrent tumor measuring 24 x 17 cm was identified and promptly resected. The recurrent tumor showed features of pleomorphic cell sarcoma mimicking malignant fibrous histiocytoma. In the pleomorphic sarcomatous area, many mitotic figures were seen, and the MIB-1 labeling index was greater than 40%, which was higher than that of the conventional chordoma area. From histological and immunohistochemical examination, the resected tumor was proven to be a dedifferentiated chordoma. This case highlights the importance of careful study of suspected chordoma to allow early identification of sarcomatous components. When we encounter a chordoma with a spindled epithelial component, we need to distinguish this tumor from a dedifferentiated chordoma and other spindle cell sarcomas such as leiomyosarcoma.</str>

      <str>To investigate the role of histone H3K27 demethylase UTX in embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, we have generated UTX knockout (KO) and enzyme-dead knock-in male ES cells. Deletion of the X-chromosome-encoded UTX gene in male ES cells markedly decreases expression of the paralogous UTY gene encoded by Y chromosome, but has no effect on global H3K27me3 level, Hox gene expression, or ES cell self-renewal. However, UTX KO cells show severe defects in mesoderm differentiation and induction of Brachyury, a transcription factor essential for mesoderm development. Surprisingly, UTX regulates mesoderm differentiation and Brachyury expression independent of its enzymatic activity. UTY, which lacks detectable demethylase activity, compensates for the loss of UTX in regulating Brachyury expression. UTX and UTY bind directly to Brachyury promoter and are required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling-induced Brachyury expression in ES cells. Interestingly, male UTX KO embryos express normal levels of UTY and survive until birth. In contrast, female UTX KO mice, which lack the UTY gene, show embryonic lethality before embryonic day 11.5. Female UTX KO embryos show severe defects in both Brachyury expression and embryonic development of mesoderm-derived posterior notochord, cardiac, and hematopoietic tissues. These results indicate that UTX controls mesoderm differentiation and Brachyury expression independent of H3K27 demethylase activity, and suggest that UTX and UTY are functionally redundant in ES cell differentiation and early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for the formation of posterior mesoderm and for axial development in both mouse and zebrafish embryos. In these species, and in Xenopus, the gene is expressed transiently throughout the presumptive mesoderm, and transcripts then persiste in notochord and posterior tissues. In Xenopus embryos, expression of the Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, can be induced in presumptive ectoderm by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin; in the absence of functional FGF or activin signalling pathways, expression of the gene is severely reduced. Ectopic expression of Xbra in presumptive ectoderm causes mesoderm to be formed. As Brachyury and its homologues encode sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, it is likely that each functions by directly activating downstream mesoderm-specific genes.</str>
      <str>We show that expression in Xenopus embryos of RNA encoding a dominant-negative FGF receptor inhibits the mesoderm-inducing activity of Xbra. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Xbra activates transcription of the embryonic FGF gene, and that embryonic FGF can induce expression of Xbra. This suggests that the two genes are components of a regulatory loop. Consistent with this idea, dissociation of Xbra-expressing cells causes a dramatic and rapid reduction in levels of Xbra, but the reduction can be inhibited by addition of FGF.</str>
      <str>Formation of mesoderm tissue requires an intact FGF signalling pathway downstream of Brachyury. This requirement is due to a regulatory loop, in which Brachyury activates expression of a member of the FGF family, and FGF maintains expression of Brachyury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Orthologues of Brachyury, a subfamily of T-box transcription factors, specify distinct cell types in different metazoan phyla, suggesting that the function of these genes has changed through the course of evolution. To investigate this evolutionary process, we have compared the activities of Brachyury orthologues from all major phyla in a single cellular context, the pluripotent Xenopus laevis animal cap. In this assay, an ancestral function is revealed: most orthologues, including the Hydra protein, mimic the action of endogenous Xenopus Brachyury, in that they induce mesoderm but not endoderm. Orthologues from Drosophila and ascidians, however, display an additional derived property, represented in our assay by the induction of endoderm. Misexpression of chimeric versions of Brachyury reveals that the C-terminal half of the protein is important for the strength of the induced response but not for its specificity. In contrast, amino acids located within the T-domain and in a short N-terminal peptide are involved in restricting the activity of Brachyury proteins to induction of mesoderm and not endoderm. Possession of this N-terminal motif is correlated with early circumblastoporal expression of Brachyury orthologues. We propose that restriction of Brachyury activity by this motif plays a conserved role in the control of Bilaterian gastrulation.</str>

      <str>The role of Brachyury and other T-box genes in the differentiation of mesoderm and endoderm of vertebrates is well established. Recently, homologues of Brachyury have been isolated from an increasing number of diverse organisms ranging from Cnidaria to vertebrates and insects. Comparative expression and function analysis allows the origin of the mesoderm and the evolution of the developmental role of Brachyury gene family in metazoans to be traced. The data suggest that an ancestral function of Brachyury was to designate a blastoporal region that had distinct properties in induction and axis elongation. A subset of blastoporal cells expressing Brachyury and other genes that convey specific mesodermal functions may have segregated as a distinct cell population from this region in the course of mesoderm evolution.</str>

      <str>Chordoid meningioma (CM) is characterized by a striking histologic resemblance to chordoma and propensity for aggressive behavior or recurrence (WHO grade II designation). Orbital intraosseous CM is extremely uncommon and only one case report has been documented. A case is presented here in which squash smears of a left orbital tumor in a 53-year-old male revealed small clusters or cord-like structures of bland tumor cells embedded in a myxoid or mucinous background. Whorl-like structures were also identified. The tumor cells possessed uniformly round nuclei with a smooth nuclear outline, fine granular chromatin, and small nucleoli. Occasional intranuclear inclusions, coarse collageneous cytoplasmic filaments were observed. Many spindle-shaped cells with similar nuclear findings were also seen. A cytologic diagnosis of a chordoid meningioma was suggested and histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were conducted on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed diffuse and strong membranous and cytoplasmic staining for vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and faintly reactive with S-100 protein but negative for pan-neuroendocrine markers (i.e., NSE, chromogranin A, synaptophysin), cytokeratin AE1/AE3, smooth muscle actin, D2-40, brachyury or class III beta-tubulin. The proliferative index with MIB-1 was less than 1%. The diagnosis of orbital intraosseous CM was confirmed based on cytopathologic, histopathological, immunohistochemical results, location of the tumor, and the lack connection to the duramater. We demonstrated here for the first time the cytopathological features of intraosseous CM with emphasis on differential diagnostic considerations.</str>

      <str>Much discussion about benign notochordal cell tissue in vertebrae has centered on the nature of its relationship, if any, to chordoma. Often referred to as benign notochordal cell tumors (BNCTs), these lesions have unique morphological features, however, differentiating between notochordal cells in discs, BNCT, and chordoma can be difficult. They are described as radiologically distinct from chordoma, with lysis, contrast enhancement, and a soft tissue mass indicating chordoma.</str>
      <str>All chordomas diagnosed at our institution, the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli (Bologna, Italy), prior to 2008 were reviewed, yielding 174 cases. Five were limited to bone; one was a recurrent chordoma without original data available. The remaining four were re-evaluated in detail.</str>
      <str>There were three women and one man, aged 33-57 years (mean, 48 years). Two were BNCTs and two were mixed lesions containing BNCT and chordoma. On computed tomography, all were radiopaque with areas of lysis. One BNCT was heterogeneous on magnetic resonance imaging, enhancing after contrast. Microscopically, one BNCT had a well-defined cystic area with a sclerotic border. The other had a minute atypical area; it recurred as chordoma. The mixed lesions had areas of definitive BNCT, definitive chordoma, and atypical areas that did not meet the criteria for either. The atypical areas in all three cases 'blended' with areas of chordoma or BNCT.</str>
      <str>These cases illustrate the ongoing challenges in differentiating between BNCT and chordoma. All had unique imaging features; three had atypical microscopic areas blending with BNCT or chordoma, strengthening the argument for a relationship between the two entities and supporting the idea that some BNCTs may progress to chordoma. Our study dispels the notion that any single radiologic criterion used to distinguish between chordoma and BNCT is reliable, opening the discussion as to whether or how to monitor BNCTs.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor Brachyury (T) is essential for formation of the posterior mesoderm and the notochord in vertebrate embryos. Work in the frog and the zebrafish has identified some direct genomic targets of Brachyury, but little is known about Brachyury targets in the mouse.</str>
      <str>Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation and mouse promoter microarrays to identify targets of Brachyury in embryoid bodies formed from differentiating mouse ES cells. The targets we identify are enriched for sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and include components of signal transduction pathways that direct cell fate in the primitive streak and tailbud of the early embryo. Expression of some of these targets, such as Axin2, Fgf8 and Wnt3a, is down regulated in Brachyury mutant embryos and we demonstrate that they are also Brachyury targets in the human. Surprisingly, we do not observe enrichment of the canonical T-domain DNA binding sequence 5'-TCACACCT-3' in the vicinity of most Brachyury target genes. Rather, we have identified an (AC)(n) repeat sequence, which is conserved in the rat but not in human, zebrafish or Xenopus. We do not understand the significance of this sequence, but speculate that it enhances transcription factor binding in the regulatory regions of Brachyury target genes in rodents.</str>

      <str>Homologues of the murine Brachyury (T) gene have been cloned from several vertebrates, and are implicated in mesoderm formation and in differentiation of the notochord. In contrast, the roles of the ascidian Brachyury gene may be restricted to presumptive notochord. To understand the evolution of Brachyury genes and their developmental roles, we have searched for homologues in amphioxus, representing the third chordate subphylum and the probable closest relative of the vertebrates. We report the isolation of two amphioxus cDNA clones with clear homology to Brachyury genes, and demonstrate that these derive from separate loci resultant from a recent gene duplication. This finding represents an exception to the emerging consensus of an archetypal prevertebrate genome in amphioxus. The spatial and temporal distribution of Brachyury transcripts during amphioxus development is remarkably similar to vertebrate Brachyury, in presumptive mesoderm, posterior mesoderm and the notochord. Gene expression extends throughout the anteroposterior axis of the notochord, despite the most rostral regions being a more recent specialization; it also persists into larval stages, despite differentiation into contractile tissue. We propose that roles of Brachyury in notochord differentiation are more ancient than roles in mesoderm formation, and that the latter are shared by cephalochordates and all vertebrates.</str>

Transcriptional targets of p63 with functions in both of these biological processes likely exist.

We found that brachyury is not expressed in developing p63-/- mouse embryos, and that in osteosarcomas, ΔNp63 and brachyury are expressed at high levels. Knock down of ΔNp63 in tumor cells resulted in a concomitant diminution of brachyury, cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

      <str>The Brachyury gene has a critical role in the formation of posterior mesoderm and notochord in vertebrate development. A recent study showed that Brachyury is also responsible for the formation of the left-right (L-R) axis in mouse and zebrafish. However, the role of Brachyury in L-R axis specification is still elusive. Here, it is demonstrated that Brachyury is involved in L-R specification of the Xenopus laevis embryo and regulates expression of Zic3, which controls the L-R specification process. Overexpression of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) and dominant-negative type Xbra (Xbra-EnR) altered the orientation of heart and gut looping, concomitant with disturbed laterality of nodal-related 1 (Xnr1) and Pitx2 expression, both of which are normally expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm. Furthermore, activation of inducible type Xbra (Xbra-GR) induces Zic3 expression within 20 min. These results suggest that a role of Brachyury in L-R specification may be the direct regulation of Zic3 expression.</str>

      <str>Brachyury (T), a member of the T-box gene family, is essential for the formation of posterior mesoderm and notochord in vertebrate development. Expression of the Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, causes ectopic ventral and lateral mesoderm formation in animal cap explants and co-expression of Xbra with Pintallavis, a forkhead/HNF3beta-related transcription factor, induces notochord. Although eFGF and the Bix genes are thought to be direct targets of Xbra, no other target genes have been identified. Here, we describe the use of hormone-inducible versions of Xbra and Pintallavis to construct cDNA libraries enriched for targets of these transcription factors. Five putative targets were isolated: Xwnt11, the homeobox gene Bix1, the zinc-finger transcription factor Xegr-1, a putative homologue of the antiproliferative gene BTG1 called Xbtg1, and BIG3/1A11, a gene of unknown function. Expression of Xegr-1 and Xbtg1 is controlled by Pintallavis alone as well as by a combination of Xbra and Pintallavis. Overexpression of Xbtg1 perturbed gastrulation and caused defects in posterior tissues and in notochord and muscle formation, a phenotype reminiscent of that observed with a dominant-negative version of Pintallavis called Pintallavis-En(R). The Brachyury-inducible genes we have isolated shed light on the mechanism of Brachyury function during mesoderm formation. Specification of mesodermal cells is regulated by targets including Bix1-4 and eFGF, while gastrulation movements and perhaps cell division are regulated by Xwnt11 and Xbtg1.</str>

      <str>Currently there is no effective chemotherapy for chordoma. Recent studies report co-expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and its cognate ligand in chordoma, but it is unknown whether this receptor tyrosine kinase is activated in these tumours. Additionally, genetic studies have confirmed frequent deletions of chromosome 9p in chordomas, which encompasses the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) locus. Another gene in this region, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), is an essential enzyme of the purine salvage pathway and has therapeutic relevance because MTAP-deficient cells are particularly sensitive to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis. We investigated whether these pathways might be potential therapeutic targets for chordoma. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 30 chordomas were analysed by immunohistochemistry for expression of the phosphorylated isoforms of IGF1R or the insulin receptor (pIGF1R/pIR) and selected downstream signalling molecules, including BCL2-associated agonist of cell death protein (BAD). Expression of CDKN2A and MTAP proteins was also assessed. Skeletal chondrosarcomas, benign notochordal cell tumours, and fetal notochord were studied for comparison. Phosphorylated IGF1R/IR was detected in 41% of chordomas, together with activated downstream signalling molecules, and pIGF1R/pIR was absent in benign notochordal cell tumours and fetal notochord. Thirty-nine per cent of chordomas were negative for MTAP immunoreactivity. Patients with pIGF1R/pIR-positive tumours showed significantly decreased median disease-free survival in multivariate survival analysis (p = 0.036), whereas phosphorylation of BAD at serine-99 was found to be associated with a favourable prognosis (p = 0.002). Approximately 40% of chordomas demonstrate evidence of activation of the IGF1R/IR signalling pathway or loss of a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. Aberrant signalling cascades and disrupted metabolic pathways such as these may represent opportunities for novel targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator that is essential for notochord differentiation in a variety of chordates. In vertebrates, Brachyury is expressed throughout the presumptive mesoderm, but becomes restricted to the notochord at later stages of development. In ascidians, such as Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in the notochord and does not exhibit an early pan-mesodermal pattern. Subtractive hybridization screens were recently used to identify potential Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) target genes (Takahashi, H., Hotta, K., Erives, A., Di Gregorio, A., Zeller, R. W., Levine, M. and Satoh, N. (1999). Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). Of the genes that were identified in this screen, one corresponds to a new member of the tropomyosin superfamily, Ciona tropomyosin (Ci-trop). Here we show that Ci-trop is specifically expressed in the developing notochord beginning at gastrulation, and expression persists in the notochord during tailbud and tadpole stages. A 3 kb region of the Ci-trop 5'-flanking sequence was characterized via electroporation of lacZ fusion genes into fertilized Ciona eggs. A minimal, 114 bp enhancer was identified that is sufficient to direct the expression of a heterologous promoter in the notochord. DNA binding assays indicate that this enhancer contains two sets of low-affinity Brachyury half-sites, which are bound in vitro by a GST/Ci-Bra fusion protein. Deletion of the distal sites inactivates the notochord-specific staining pattern mediated by an otherwise normal Ci-trop/lacZ transgene. These results suggest that Ci-trop is a direct target gene of Ci-Bra and that Brachyury plays an immediate role in the cellular morphogenesis of the notochord.</str>

      <str>Our recent work demonstrated that common cardiovascular progenitor cells are characterized and induced by the expression of the transcription factor mesoderm posterior1 (MesP1) in vertebrate embryos and murine embryonic stem cells. As the proliferative potential of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is limited, it is crucial to understand how MesP1 expression is mediated in order to achieve reasonable and reliable yields for novel stem cell-based therapeutic options. As potential upstream regulators of MesP1, we therefore analysed Eomes and Brachyury(T), which had been controversially discussed as being crucial for cardiovasculogenic lineage formation.</str>
      <str>Wild-type and transgenic murine embryonic stem cell lines, mRNA analyses, embryoid body formation, and cell sorting revealed that the MesP1 positive population emerges from the Brachyury(T) positive fraction. In situ hybridizations using wild-type mouse embryos confirmed that Brachyury(T) colocalises with MesP1 in vivo. Likewise, shRNA-based loss of Brachyury(T) causes a dramatic decrease in MesP1 expression accompanied by reduced cardiac markers in differentiating embryonic stem cells, which is reflected in vivo via in situ hybridizations using Brachyury(T) knock-out embryos where MesP1 mRNA is greatly abolished. We finally defined a 3.4 kb proximal MesP1-promoter fragment which is directly bound and activated by Brachyury(T) via a T responsive element as shown via bandshift, chromatin immuneprecipitation, and reporter assays.</str>

      <str>Brachyury proteins, a conserved subgroup of the T domain transcription factors, specify gut and posterior mesoderm derivatives throughout the animal kingdom. The T domain confers DNA-binding properties to Brachyury proteins, but little is known how these proteins regulate their target genes. We characterized a direct target gene of the Drosophila Brachyury-homolog Brachyenteron. Brachyenteron activates the homeobox gene orthopedia in a dose-dependent manner via multiple binding sites with the consensus (A/G)(A/T)(A/T)NTN(A/G)CAC(C/T)T. The sites and their A/T-rich flanking regions are conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. Reporter assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate that Brachyenteron binding sites confer in part additive, in part synergistic effects on otp transcription levels. This suggests an interaction of Brachyenteron proteins on the DNA, which we could map to a conserved motif within the T domain. Mouse Brachyury also interacts with Brachyenteron through this motif. We further show that the Xenopus and mouse Brachyury homologs activate orthopedia expression when expressed in Drosophila embryonic cells. We propose that the mechanisms to achieve target gene expression through variable binding sites and through defined protein-protein interactions might be conserved for Brachyury relatives.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare neoplasm arising in the cerebrospinal axis from nothochordal remnants. The commonest location is in the sacrococcygeal area, then in the sphenooccipital region and less frequently in other parts of the vertebral column. Chordoma has been found in all age groups, but the greatest incidence was found between the fifth and the seventh decades: there is a male predominance. Signs and symptoms of chordoma are related to tumor location and are often present for a long period of time because of the slow growth of the neoplasia. Sacrococcygeal chordomas may produce lower back pain, bladder or anorectal dysfunction or mass. Three histologic subtypes are currently considered: conventional, chondroid and dedifferentiated chordoma. Comparing with conventional chordoma, chondroid chordoma shows a better prognosis while dedifferentiated chordoma has a worse prognosis. However the malignant potential of chordoma is most likely due to incomplete surgical excision because of the multifocality of the neoplastic growth. For that reason, local recurrence is common and accounts in large part for the mortality for this tumor. The best treatment consists of a wide surgical excision coupled with adjuvant radiation therapy. We report a case of sacrococcygeal chordoma arised in a 48 year-old-man; the clinical features of the tumor showed a close resemblance with a pilonidal cyst. When the diagnosis of conventional chordoma was done the patient were treated by surgery and by intraoperative radiotherapy followed by external radiotherapy. This peculiar therapy was adopted in the attempt to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Six months after this treatment the patient was well and no signs of local recurrence was found by the magnetic resonance imaging.</str>

      <str>Early detection of lung cancer is challenging due to a lack of adequate biomarkers. To discover novel tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) silenced by aberrant promoter methylation, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines using pharmacologic-unmasking and subsequent microarray-analysis. Among 617 genes upregulated, we selected 30 genes and investigated the methylation status of their promoters by bisulfite sequencing analysis. Aberrant methylation was detected in four genes (CRABP2, NOEY2, T, MAP2K3) in at least one lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, the T promoter was methylated in 60% of primary lung adenocarcinomas versus 13% of non-malignant lung tissues. Conversely, RT-PCR analysis revealed T expression was low in lung tumors, while high in normal tissues. In addition, no non-synonymous mutations related to gene silencing were found. While further analysis is warranted, our results suggest that T has the potential to be a novel candidate TSG in lung cancer.</str>

Because of these traits, we believe this case shows features superimposable to those seen in sarcomatoid carcinoma.</str>

      <str>Chordomas usually occur in the axial skeleton and they arise from the remnants of notochord. Their growth is slow and they often metastase. Most frequently chordomas are situated in sacral bone (50%), in spheno-occipital region of the skull base (35%) and in the cervical and lumbar spine (15%). We reported an unusual case of chordoma of the cervical spine with participation of the parapharyngeal space.

      <str>Chordomas are malignant tumors of the axial skeleton, characterized by their locally invasive and slow but aggressive growth. These neoplasms are presumed to be derived from notochordal remnants with a molecular alteration preceding their malignant transformation. As these tumors are most frequently observed on the skull base and sacrum, patients suffering from a chordoma present with debilitating neurological disease, and have an overall 5-year survival rate of 65%. Surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy is the first-choice treatment modality in these patients, since chordomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Even so, management of chordomas can be challenging, as chordoma patients often present with recurrent disease. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular events that contribute to the development of chordomas are promising; the most novel finding being the identification of brachyury in the disease process. Here we present an overview of the current paradigms and summarize relevant research findings. </str>

      <str>'Chordoma' represents orphan sarcoma subtypes in which systemic treatments have so far proved ineffective. Two original papers in the Journal of Pathology have recently elucidated important steps of its molecular oncogenesis. The demonstration of gains of copy number of both T (brachyury homologue) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) genes in chordoma, as well as of their role in promoting cell proliferation, offers a strong preclinical rationale for exploring the inhibition of their products as a credible therapeutic strategy. When dealing with rare cancers, clinical trials based on a frequency-based statistical methodology are hardly feasible. To override the limitations of rarity, the clinical community is suggesting the adoption of a Bayesian methodology. The success of innovative clinical trials strongly depends upon the availability of preclinical evidences of efficacy. The papers discussed herein represent good examples of what is actually needed to set up a solid prior probability.</str>

      <str>The mouse Brachyury (T) gene plays critical roles in the genesis of normal mesoderm during gastrulation and in the maintenance of a functioning notochord. Abrogation of Brachyury (T) expression within the chordamesoderm of homozygous null mutants nevertheless spares anterior axis formation. An intriguing possibility to explain the preservation of anterior axis formation in these mutants would be the existence of other genes compensating for the loss of Brachyury. This compensation and the recent demonstration that Brachyury is the prototype for an evolutionarily conserved family, prompted a search for other T-box genes participating in axis formation. The chick Brachyury orthologue and two related chick T-box genes that are expressed at the onset of gastrulation have been isolated. One of these novel genes (Ch-TbxT) becomes restricted to the axial mesoderm lineage and is a potential candidate for complementing or extending Brachyury function in the anterior axis (formation of the head process, prechordal plate). The other gene (Ch-Tbx6L), together with chick T, appears to mark primitive streak progenitors before gastrulation. As cells leave the primitive streak, Ch-Tbx6L becomes restricted to the early paraxial mesoderm lineage and could play a role in regulating somitogenesis.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare embryogenetic tumors, arising from remnants of the notochord, characterized by local invasiveness and variable tendency for recurrence. No molecular markers are currently used in a clinical setting to distinguish chordomas with an indolent or an aggressive pattern. Among the genetic lesions observed in this tumor, one of the most commonly detected is 1p loss. In a previous study we observed 1p36 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 85% of the analyzed chordomas. We studied a group of 16 homogeneously treated skull base chordomas (SBCs), reporting 1p36 LOH in 75% of them and determining the expression pattern of eight apoptotic genes mapped at 1p36. No tumors shared a common expression profile with nucleus pulposus, which is considered the only adult normal tissue deriving from notochord. In particular, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily genes TNFRSF8, TNFRSF9, and TNFRSF14 were differently expressed compared with control in a higher percentage of tumors (40%-53%) than were the remaining analyzed genes, suggesting that the deregulation of these three genes might have a role in chordoma tumorigenesis. The presence/absence of LOH and the expression/nonexpression of each apoptotic gene were studied in a survival analysis. Our results suggest that the lack of 1p36 LOH or the presence of TNFRSF8 expression might be associated with a better prognosis in patients with SBCs.</str>

      <str>The switch of tumor cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal-like phenotype [designated as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)] is known to induce tumor cell motility and invasiveness, therefore promoting metastasis of solid carcinomas. Although multiple studies have focused on elucidating the signaling events that initiate this phenotypic switch, there has been so far no characterization of the pattern of soluble mediators released by tumor cells undergoing EMT, and the potential impact that this phenotypic switch could have on the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Here we show that induction of EMT in human carcinoma cells via overexpression of the transcription factor Brachyury is associated with enhanced secretion of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors and, in particular, with the induction of the IL-8/IL-8R axis. Our results also indicate the essential role of interleukin 8 (IL-8) signaling for the acquisition and/or maintenance of the mesenchymal and invasive features of Brachyury-overexpressing tumor cells and show that IL-8 secreted by tumor cells undergoing EMT could potentiate tumor progression by inducing adjacent epithelial tumor cells into EMT. Altogether, our results emphasize the potential role of EMT in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment via secretion of multiple soluble mediators and suggest that IL-8 signaling blockade may provide a means of targeting mesenchymal-like, invasive tumor cells.</str>

An autopsy revealed a massive clival mass and widespread metastases in the dura mater, skull bone, bilateral lungs, liver, sternum, left humerus, and vertebrae. Pathological findings showed that the tumor cells were poorly differentiated, with a rare, but typical, physaliphorous appearance. The presence of epithelial differentiation proteins, mitochondria surrounded by rough endoplasmic reticulum, and desmosomes was demonstrated in the tumor cells both immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Thus, the tumor was diagnosed as a chordoma. The literature pertaining to intracranial chordoma in early childhood is reviewed.

Although the lesion exhibited the classic histological features of a chordoma, it differed significantly in its extraosseous location.

      <str>Although a bone tumor, significant differences in the extent of bone invasion exist in skull base chordoma, which directly affect the extent of surgical resection, and have an impact on its prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon is not clearly understood. Therefore, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics strategy to identify potential molecular signatures, and to find predictive markers of discrepancy in bone invasion of clivus chordoma. According to bone invasive classification criteria, 35 specimens of clivus chordoma were calssified to be either endophytic type (Type I) or exophytic type (Type II). An initial screening of six specimens of endophytic type and six of exophytic was performed, and 250 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Through the GO and IPA analysis, we found evidence that the expression of inflammatory activity-associated proteins up-regulated in endophytic type, whereas the expression of cell motility-associated proteins up-regulated in exophytic ones. Moreover, TGFβ1 and mTOR signal pathway seemed to be related with bone invasion. Thus, TGFβ1, PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and PTEN were validated in the following 23 samples by immune histochemistry and Western blot. The expression levels of TGFβ1 and PTEN were significantly lower in the endophytic type than in the exophytic ones. It was found that TGFβ1 may play an important role in its bone invasion. The mechanisms may be related with conducting an increased inflammatory cell response and a decline in cytoskeletal protein expression. PTEN is confirmed to be associated with the degree of bone invasion. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might be associated with the bone invasion, but still needs a larger sample size to be verified These results, for the first time, not only demonstrate the biological changes that occur in different growth patterns from the perspective of proteomics, but also provide novel markers that may help to reveal the mechanisms behind clivus chordomas. </str>

This tumor consisted of two parts: a chordoma without symptoms of aggressive cellular proliferation and a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. During the following 4 years several local recurrences of the malignant fibrous histiocytoma occurred in the gluteal musculature. The patient finally died of lung metastases. No chordoma tumor tissue was found in the lungs, in the gluteal musculature or in the sacrococcygeal bone area. Histology including electron microscopy revealed no proof of a transition of chordoma into malignant fibrous histiocytoma. It must be assumed that the secondary soft tissue tumor originated from residual chordoma cells which were implanted during the operation of the primary tumor. It remains unclear whether the malignant fibrous histiocytoma arose from mesenchymal stromal cells within the chordoma or directly from primitive neuroectodermal chorda cells which possess the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including mesenchymal cells.</str>

      <str>A new phenotype mapping to the t-complex, which is designated Brachyury the Second (T2), is characterized by a slightly shortened tail in heterozygotes and homozygous failure to form an organized notochord with subsequent abnormal development of posterior somites and neural tube. The phenotype of T2 superficially resembles that of Brachyury; however, there are several important differences. Brachyury homozygotes fail to make posterior somites, notochord, floor plate, and a placental connection, resulting in death by 10.5 days of development. In contrast, T2 homozygotes make posterior somites, scattered notochord cells, and floorplate and achieve an allantoic connection. However, despite making a maternal connection, T2 homozygotes cease development at E11.5 and die soon after. We have cloned and analyzed the transgene insertion site, which maps within 100 kb of the Brachyury gene, but does not seem to physically interrupt nor affect transcription from that locus. The existence of a second gene mapping near Brachyury and affecting the same developmental processes was alluded to over 50 years ago and has been debated ever since. An embryological description of T2 is presented, as is a discussion of the implications of a single, larger Brachyury locus versus two closely linked genes coordinately regulating axial development.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing primary malignant neoplasm of the axial skeleton, which arises from the remnants of the notochord. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) are dysregulated in chordoma tissues and crucially involved in chordoma pathogenesis. In the present study, the expression of 11 candidate miRs were analyzed in chordoma tissues and miR-10a and miR-125a were found to be significantly downregulated compared with controls. Notably, the expression of the primary transcripts, pri-miR-125a and pri-miR-10a was unaltered, suggesting that disturbed microRNA expression may be induced by altered pri-miRNA processing. Previous studies have indicated that disturbed adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) expression is able to alter mRNA and miRNA adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) levels associated with cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, the expression of ADAR1 and ADAR2 was analyzed in chordoma tissues. It was found that ADAR1 was significantly overexpressed, which was accompanied by enhanced pre-miR-10a and pri-miR-125a A-to-I editing. These findings suggest that ADAR2 overexpression causes enhanced pre-miR-10a and pri-miR-125a A-to-I editing, which alters mature miR-10a and miR-125a expression and may contribute to chordoma pathogenesis.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, slow growing malignant tumor arising from remnants of the fetal notochord. Surgery is the first choice for chordoma treatment, followed by radiotherapy, although postoperative complications remain significant. Recurrence of the disease occurs frequently due to the anatomy of the tumor location and violation of the tumor margins at the initial surgery. Currently, there are no effective drugs available for patients with chordoma. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is limited opportunity to test agents in clinical trials and no concerted effort to develop agents for chordoma in the pharmaceutical industry. To rapidly and efficiently identify small molecules that inhibit chordoma cell growth, we screened the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) containing approximately 2800 clinically approved and investigational drugs at 15 different concentrations in chordoma cell lines, U-CH1 and U-CH2. We identified a group of drugs including bortezomib, 17-AAG, digitoxin, staurosporine, digoxin, rubitecan, and trimetrexate that inhibited chordoma cell growth, with potencies from 10 to 370 nM in U-CH1 cells, but less potently in U-CH2 cells. Most of these drugs also induced caspase 3/7 activity with a similar rank order as the cytotoxic effect on U-CH1 cells. Cantharidin, digoxin, digitoxin, staurosporine, and bortezomib showed similar inhibitory effect on cell lines and 3 primary chordoma cell cultures. The combination treatment of bortezomib with topoisomerase I and II inhibitors increased the therapeutic potency in U-CH2 and patient-derived primary cultures. Our results provide information useful for repurposing currently approved drugs for chordoma and potential approach of combination therapy. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant tumors arising in bone of the spheno-occiput, sacrum, and vertebral column which can cause neurological deficit. Current management of chordoma involves safe resection followed by radiation therapy. However, surgical resection is often subtotal and chordoma often recurs despite optimal therapy. Despite years of effort, effective adjuvant therapy for denovo, recurrent and metastatic chordoma are absent and 5-year survival is at best 65%. While no chemotherapeutic agent has been demonstrated to be effective against chordoma in vivo, a greater understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of chordoma is opening up avenues of investigation towards the rational development of targeted therapies. Although enthusiasm for the use of already established or new investigational agents will increase with greater understanding of chordoma biology, laboratory studies of these agents are important prior to incorporation into clinical human trials.

      <str>Chordoma is an uncommon tumor initially believed to be benign due to the rarity of its metastasis. Cytological, morphological, and immunohistochemical features of chordoma, relating to its origin from notochordal remnants, allows for its accurate diagnosis. A 75-year-old man with a known history of tuberculosis (TB) presented with shortness of breath and a dry cough. A chest X-ray demonstrated a diffuse, infiltrative miliary pattern in both lungs. Bronchial washings submitted for culture and cytological examination did not identify any tuberculous bacilli. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed focal areas of myxoid regions with small, round, uniform mononuclear cells. There was a documented past history of chordoma arising from the L2 vertebrae. Because of the rarity of this lesion in the lung and the limited diagnostic material available with a clinical history of TB and lumbar chordoma, the pathological report rendered on the FNAC was "atypical cells suspicious for metastatic chordoma." A wedge biopsy of the lung confirmed the presence of metastatic pulmonary chordoma. Despite palliative treatment, he died within a year. Although the metastatic potential of chordomas has been recognized and documented, to the best of our knowledge, metastasis of chordoma to the lung diagnosed by FNAC with cytohistological correlation has not been previously reported in the English literature.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a relatively rare locally invasive and potentially malignant tumor of fetal notochord origin, affecting the axial skeleton. Cytopathological diagnosis of chordoma is favored by the presence of characteristic physaliphorous cells, bearing abundant foamy cytoplasm dispersed in a myxoid matrix. Anaplastic chordoma or dedifferentiated chordoma, an even rarer variant, can cause a diagnostic confusion with chondrosarcoma from the cytopathological point of view, with similar chondromyxoid matrix and atypical cells. Hence, chordoma bearing anaplastic features needs to be identified and should be distinguished from chondrosarcoma on aspiration cytopathology. We present a case of anaplastic sacral chordoma in a man 59 years of age, causing extensive destruction of sacrum and invading the paravertebral tissues as evidenced by radiology. Fine needle aspiration cytopathology revealed few large pleomorphic hyperchromatic cells, admixed with characteristic physaliphorous cells and myxoid matrix. The cytopathological diagnosis has been confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Since anaplastic chordoma bears an unfavorable prognosis, it should be suspected on preoperative aspiration cytopathology. Clinicoradiological correlation along with histopathological and immunohistochemical confirmation is necessary subsequently.</str>

      <str>High-dose, single-fraction radiotherapy, also known as radiosurgery, has theoretical advantages for the treatment of chordoma, which is considered resistant to conventional radiation therapy.

      <str>A 72-year-old man presented with lower back pain and was found to have an L3 vertebral mass. Open biopsy yielded chordoma. He was considered for en bloc resection, but definitive radiation therapy was preferred owing to medical comorbidities and concern for field contamination from the previous biopsy.</str>
      <str>The patient underwent single-fraction, high-dose, image-guided radiation therapy to the tumor. Two months later, he underwent kyphoplasty because of recurrent pain.

      <str>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multipotent cytokine that is mediated by its receptor, c-MET. HGF/c-MET contributes to tumor progression in many human malignancies; however, HGF/c-MET is inversely correlated with aggressive biologic behavior in other cancers. Conversely, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the significance of HGF/c-MET expression in skull base chordoma.</str>
      <str>Using immunohistochemical techniques, the authors investigated HGF/c-MET expression in 46 primary and 25 recurrent lesions, and compared it with the expression of proteinases and cell differentiation markers, proliferative ability, and other clinicopathologic parameters.</str>
      <str>c-MET was found to be expressed in 70.0% of primary and 88.0% of recurrent lesions. HGF expression was scarcely detected. Higher c-MET expression was found to be correlated with younger patient age. Lesions with a higher expression of low molecular weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2) demonstrated significantly higher c-MET scores in both primary and recurrent lesions compared with those with lower CAM5.2 expression. In recurrent lesions, higher c-MET expression was found to be associated with the scores of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA); however, only uPA was found to be correlated with higher c-MET expression in primary lesions. c-MET expression did not appear to be correlated with MIB-1 labeling index. Patients with higher c-MET expression were found to have longer survival.</str>

      <str>Insulin and insulin-like-growth-factor 1 (IGF1) are components of the uterine secretions. As potent growth factors they influence early embryo development. The underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report on the effects of insulin and IGF1 on early gastrulation in rabbit blastocysts. We have studied blastocysts grown in vivo in metabolically healthy rabbits, in rabbits with type 1 diabetes and in vitro in the presence or absence of insulin or IGF1. Embryonic disc morphology and expression of Brachyury, Wnt3a and Wnt4 were analysed by qPCR and IHC. Pre-gastrulated blastocysts (stage 0/1) cultured with insulin or IGF1 showed a significantly higher capacity to form the posterior mesoderm and primitive streak (stage 2 and 3) than blastocysts cultured without growth factors. In gastrulating blastocysts the levels of the mesoderm-specific transcription factor Brachyury and the Wnt signalling molecules Wnt3a and Wnt4 showed a stage-specific expression pattern with Brachyury transcripts increasing from stage 0/1 to 3. Wnt4 protein was found spread over the whole embryoblast. Insulin induced Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury expression in a temporal- and stage-specific pattern. Only blastocysts cultured with insulin reached the Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury expression levels of stage 2 in vivo blastocysts, indicating that insulin is required for Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury expression during gastrulation. Insulin-induced Wnt3a and Wnt4 expression preceded Brachyury. Wnt3a-induced expression could be depleted by MEK1 inhibition (PD98059). Involvement of insulin in embryonic Wnt3a expression was further shown in vivo with Wnt3a expression being notably down regulated in stage 2 blastocysts from rabbits with type 1 diabetes. Blastocysts grown in diabetic rabbits are retarded in development, a finding which supports our current results that insulin is highly likely required for early mesoderm formation in rabbit blastocysts by inducing a distinct spatiotemporal expression profile of Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury.</str>

      <str>The appearance of the notochord represented a milestone in Deuterostome evolution. The notochord is necessary for the development of the chordate body plan and for the formation of the vertebral column and numerous organs. It is known that the transcription factor Brachyury is required for notochord formation in all chordates, and that it controls transcription of a large number of target genes. However, studies of the structure of the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) through which this control is exerted are complicated in vertebrates by the genomic complexity and the pan-mesodermal expression territory of Brachyury. We used the ascidian Ciona, in which the single-copy Brachyury is notochord-specific and CRMs are easily identifiable, to carry out a systematic characterization of Brachyury-downstream notochord CRMs. We found that Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) controls most of its targets directly, through non-palindromic binding sites that function either synergistically or individually to activate early- and middle-onset genes, respectively, while late-onset target CRMs are controlled indirectly, via transcriptional intermediaries. These results illustrate how a transcriptional regulator can efficiently shape a shallow gene regulatory network into a multi-tiered transcriptional output, and provide insights into the mechanisms that establish temporal read-outs of gene expression in a fast-developing chordate embryo. </str>

      <str>In this case report, we describe a sacral chordoma, which had an atypical presentation as a mobile, encapsulated, benign soft tissue mass. The patient was asymptomatic, except for the slight enlargement of this lesion. Biopsy of this mass showed a lobulated tumor with bland neoplastic cells in a rich myxoid matrix with the classical immunohistochemical profile of chordoma. Opposite to this classical histological picture of chordoma, the imaging studies (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) could not find any sacral involvement or lytic destruction. Surgical excision of this chordoma confirmed all preoperative findings and diagnoses, showing an encapsulated mass in the sacral soft tissue that has not invaded into the sacrum. This chordoma originated from the sacrococcygeal joint and grew parallel to the sacrum and below the skin. At the same time, histological sections and immunostains reconfirmed diagnosis of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chordomas of the skull base are generally regarded as slow-growing tumors; however, approximately 20% of these lesions have been shown to recur as early as 1 year postsurgery. The classic pathological paradigms are poor predictors of outcome, and additional markers are needed to identify patients at risk for early tumor recurrence. In this study the authors describe such a marker.</str>
      <str>In a series of 26 patients with chordomas of the skull base, the authors investigated the relationship between the biological behavior of the tumor, which was determined according to the interval for its recurrence and volume doubling time, and several pathological and molecular features, which included the histological variant, proliferative activity, mutation of p53 protein, expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) messenger (m)RNA, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and microsatellite instability. The major finding in this study was that hTERT mRNA expression in chordoma cells identifies those tumors that exhibit unusually fast rates of growth. The expression of hTERT mRNA was frequently associated with mutation of p53 protein, indicating that telomerase dysfunction combines with abnormal p53 function to initiate the unrestrained clonal expansion of the tumor cells. In cases in which the tumor was partially removed, mutation of p53 protein and expression of hTERT mRNA predicted increased doubling time for residual tumor as well as the probability of tumor recurrence. Cell proliferation, as investigated using the Ki-67 method, was significantly related to the tumor doubling time; however, the authors found that the pattern of cell proliferation was not homogeneous throughout the chordoma tissue, and that the proliferative index might change by a factor as high as 8 among different regions of the same tumor. The LOH and microsatellite instability do not seem to affect the prognosis of skull base chordomas.</str>
      <str>Reactivation of telomerase in chordomas is a reliable predictor of outcome. The ability to predict the biological behavior of chordomas might have immediate implications in the management of this disease in patients who undergo surgery.</str>

      <str>Chordoma, an age-dependent rare cancer, arises from notochordal remnants. Fewer than 5% of chordomas occur in children. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by abnormal tissue growths in multiple organ systems. Reports of chordoma in children with TSC suggest that TSC1 and TSC2 mutations may contribute to chordoma aetiology.</str>

      <str>TSC-associated paediatric chordomas differed from chordomas in the general paediatric population: median age at diagnosis (6.2 months, TSC, vs 12.5 years, SEER); anatomical site (40% sacral, TSC, vs 9.4% sacral, SEER); and site-specific age at diagnosis (all four sacral chordomas diagnosed during the fetal or neonatal period, TSC, vs all six sacral chordomas diagnosed at &gt;15 years, SEER). Finally, three of four patients with TSC-associated sacral chordoma were alive and tumour-free at 2.2, 8 and 19 years after diagnosis versus a median survival of 36 months among paediatric patients with sacral chordoma in SEER.</str>

      <str>A case of spinal thoracic chordoma involving the T9 vertebra in a 70-year-old male patient, destroying the vertebral body and invading the vertebral canal with compression of the spinal cord, is presented. The patient was referred to our neurosurgical unit with a history of an irradiated metastatic adenocarcinoma to the thoracic vertebra, a diagnosis that was rendered 3 years earlier at another hospital on presentation. This misdiagnosis was likely due to the absolute rarity of thoracic vertebral chordomas (2%-3% of all chordomas), the higher frequency of metastatic deposits to the vertebrae from visceral cancers in the elderly, the limited amount of biopsy material available for histologic examination, and the epithelial phenotype of the tumor (keratin/EMA positive). The patient underwent second palliative surgery with subtotal piecemeal removal of the tumor bringing relief of the neurologic symptoms. The bulk of the tumor was represented by a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with adjacent areas of atypical chordoma. Small foci of conventional chordoma were also found. The previous histologic slides were also reviewed, which were consistent with the areas of atypical chordoma. Small targeted tissue fragments from areas of (atypical) chordoma and from sarcomatous areas were recovered for electron microscopy. The fine features of chordoma and focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation were found with the latter retrospectively supported by immunohistochemical detection of striated muscle markers. A final diagnosis of dedifferentiated chordoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation was finally established. Rhabdomyoblastic metaplasia is a novelty in dedifferentiated chordoma.

Primary treatment with surgical excision and radiotherapy for residual or recurrent tumor is recommended.

      <str>A 26-year-old woman was operated on for a bulky tumor in the sacral region; she died of massive local tumor recurrence and pulmonary metastases 3 months later. Most of the original tumor showed a highly cellular spindle-cell sarcoma compatible with a fibrosarcoma of a high grade of malignancy. In a few small areas of the tumor, a chordoma-like pattern surrounded by growth of spindle-cell sarcoma was found. The spindle-cell component exhibited vimentin positivity in all tumor cells, but many cells were also cytokeratin-positive. The chordoma-like areas showed cytokeratin in all tumor cells. The chordoma-like areas, but not the spindle-cell areas also were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and S-100 protein. This case indicates that the sarcomatous change associated with chordoma may contain keratins as a sign of epithelial differentiation, and may thus represent sarcomatous transformation of chordoma cells, rather than a coincidental soft-tissue sarcoma or collision tumor.</str>

      <str>Chondroid chordoma is a controversial and confusing entity that was originally described by Heffelfinger et al. (Cancer 1973; 32:410-420) as a biphasic malignant neoplasm possessing elements of both chordoma and cartilaginous tissue. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of chondroid chordoma has not been described. The aim of our investigation was to characterize the chondroid area of chondroid chordoma and to compare the FNA features with those of well-differentiated chondrosarcoma. Clival and cervical spine chondroid chordomas were studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Chondroid chordomas demonstrated an epithelial nature by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural studies. The FNA smears showed low cellularity, with loosely arranged or dispersed round cells in a myxoid background. Although the smears were similar to those of well-differentiated chondrosarcomas, they showed a positive reaction for epithelial markers. These findings reveal that chondroid chordoma is a variant of chordoma which possesses a hyaline matrix. Immunohistochemical demonstration of epithelial markers is useful to distinguish it from chondrosarcoma. Diagn. Cytopathol. 1999; 21:335-339.</str>

      <str>Chondroid chordoma is a rare variant of chordoma and is usually located in the sphenooccipital region. This tumor shows clinical and histologic features common to both conventional chordoma and low grade chondrosarcoma and has a better prognosis than either of those lesions. To our knowledge, there has been no English language report describing its cytologic features.</str>
      <str>The cytologic features of skull base chondroid chordoma observed in intraoperative crush and touch preparations from a 33-year-old female are reported. Touch cytology revealed round or stellate cells distributed in a mucoid background without a typical epithelial cordlike arrangement. The cells had variably vacuolated cytoplasm and round or oval nuclei and showed slight cellular pleomorphism. May-Giemsa staining was superior to Papanicolaou staining in demonstrating the mucoid matrix and vacuolated cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Additionally, crush preparations were effective in demonstrating well-differentiated chondroid elements. Immunocytochemistry with positivity for S-100 protein and cytokeratins was an essential adjunct in the cytologic diagnosis of chordoma and helped in distinguishing it from other chondrogenic tumors.</str>

      <str>Galectin-3 is an endogenous carbohydrate-binding protein which plays a role in cell differentiation, morphogenesis and cancer biology. We investigated the occurrence and distribution of galectin-3 in the embryonic and fetal human notochord, the developing human vertebral column, adult intervertebral discs and in six chordomas, which are tumors thought to originate from notochordal remnants. By means of Western blots, the expression of galectin-3 was confirmed in tissue probes from the vertebral column region beginning with the 8th gestational week. These results were supported by immunohistochemical data which revealed the presence of galectin-3 in the cytoplasm of cells of the notochord also from the 8th gestational week onwards. Notochordal immunostaining became stronger with increasing gestational age. A persisting notochordal remnant in an adult intervertebral disc and various cells of the nucleus pulposus also contained galectin-3. All chordomas showed moderate or strong immunoreactivity irrespective of their cellular composition. Subcellularly, galectin-3 was localized mostly in the cytoplasm, while a subset of tumor cells also showed nuclear distribution. Differences in staining patterns of chordoma cells could not, in general, be correlated to any histological features of these tumors.</str>

      <str>The aim of our study was to characterize mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells P19 in different stages of retinoic acid induced neurodifferentiation by two methods, immunocytochemistry and RT qPCR. The characterization of the cells is crucial before any transplantation into any model, e.g. in our case into the mouse brain with the aim to treat a neurodegenerative disease. Specific protein markers (MAP-2, OCT-4, FORSE-1) were detected by immunocytochemistry in the cell cultures. The mRNA expression levels of PAX-6, MASH-1, Brachyury, GATA-4 and AFP were determined by RT qPCR method. HPRT was used as a housekeeping gene. The degree of differentiation can be characterized by expression of analyzed genes. The presence of OCT-4 and FORSE-1 proteins in undifferentiated pluripotent cells and the presence of dendrite specific MAP-2 in neuroprogenitors was detected. The expression levels of PAX-6 and MASH-1 increased and expression of Brachyury decreased during the neurodifferentiation process. The expression levels of GATA-4 and AFP were the highest after induction of differentiation with retinoic acid. Detailed characterization of cells before transplantation experiments can contribute to better understanding of their effect.</str>

      <str>Appendicularia (Larvacea) is a subgroup of Urochordata (Tunicata) comprised of holoplanktonic organisms that retain their tailed architecture throughout their life history, while other tunicates, including ascidians and doliolids, resorb the tail after metamorphosis. In order to investigate the characteristics of the appendicularian unresorbed notochord, we isolated a partial genomic clone and a full-length cDNA sequence homologous to the mouse Brachyury (T) gene from the appendicularian Oikopleura longicauda. Brachyury is known to be predominantly expressed in the notochord cells and plays an important role in their differentiation in other chordates. While phylogenetic analysis robustly supports the orthology of the isolated Brachyury gene, the exon-intron organization found in the genomic clone was distinct from that well-conserved among other T-box genes. In addition to a detailed observation of notochord development in living specimens, whole-mount double in situ hybridization was carried out using a Brachyury probe along with a muscle actin probe. The Brachyury transcripts were found in the notochord of the tailbud embryos and persisted into later stages. The present study highlights characteristics of notochord development in the appendicularian. Furthermore, these results provide basic knowledge for comprehensive understanding of the cellular- and molecular-based mechanisms needed to build the characteristic cytoarchitecture of notochord that varies among tunicate species.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are radio- and chemo-resistant tumours and metastasise in as many as 40% of patients. The aim of this study was to identify potential molecular targets for the treatment of chordoma. In view of the reported association of chordoma and tuberous sclerosis complex syndrome, and the available therapeutic agents against molecules in the PI3K/AKT/TSC1/TSC2/mTOR pathway, a tissue microarray of 50 chordoma cases was analysed for expression of active molecules involved in this signalling pathway by immunohistochemistry and a selected number by western blot analysis. Chordomas were positive for p-AKT (92%), p-TSC2 (96%), p-mTOR (27%), total mTOR (75%), p-p70S6K (62%), p-RPS6 (22%), p-4E-BP1 (96%) and eIF-4E (98%). Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 expression was lost in 16% of cases. Mutations failed to be identified in PI3KCA and RHEB1 in the 23 cases for which genomic DNA was available. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis for mTOR and RPS6 loci showed that 11 of 33 and 21 of 44 tumours had loss of one copy of the respective genes, results which correlated with the loss of the relevant total proteins. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis for loci containing TSC1 and TSC2 revealed that all cases analysed harboured two copies of the respective genes. On the basis of p-mTOR and or p-p70S6K expression there is evidence indicating that 65% of the chordomas studied may be responsive to mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin or its analogues, and that patients may benefit from combined therapy including drugs that inhibit AKT.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are locally invasive tumors that have a tendency to relapse despite optimal treatment. Specific biological markers might be used to describe their behavior. There is currently no agreement regarding the best way to manage intracranial chordomas. We studied the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and Ki-M1P in 145 paraffin-embedded tumors. The purpose of our study was to determine: (a) the role of potent angiogenic factors VEGFR-2 and iNOS and their relationship to each other in skull base chordoma and (b) the role of monocytes/macrophages as a potential iNOS source in the angiogenic process. A series of 74 chordoma patients for a total of 145 lesions (including 71 recurrent lesions) and 10 specimens from embryonic notochord were investigated for the expression of iNOS, VEGFR-2, Ki-M1P, and CD-34 using immunohistochemistry. In the majority of the chordomas, correlations were found between iNOS and the immunoreactivity of Ki-M1P (r = 0.5303, P &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, the expressions of Ki-M1P was correlated with VEGFR-2 (r = 0.4181, P &lt; 0.0001). Our results indicate that chordomas may respond to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as VEGFR-2 or modulators of other downstream signaling molecules. The future of VEGFR-2 and iNOS inhibitors as therapeutic agents in the treatment of chordoma will be clearer over the next years as results of the current clinical trials become available and as the factors regulating angiogenesis and the interactions between these factors are elucidated. However, appropriate functional experiments remain to be conducted to prove such a hypothesis. </str>

      <str>The Nkx2-5 homeodomain protein plays a key role in cardiomyogenesis. Ectopic expression in frog and zebrafish embryos results in an enlarged myocardium; however, expression of Nkx2-5 in fibroblasts was not able to trigger the development of beating cardiac muscle. In order to examine the ability of Nkx2-5 to modulate endogenous cardiac specific gene expression in cells undergoing early stages of differentiation, P19 cell lines overexpressing Nkx2-5 were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO. Nkx2-5 expression induced cardiomyogenesis in these cultures aggregated without Me2SO. During differentiation into cardiac muscle, Nkx2-5 expression resulted in the activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), but not MEF2A, -B, or -D. In order to compare the abilities of Nkx2-5 and MEF2C to induce cellular differentiation, P19 cells overexpressing MEF2C were aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Similar to Nkx2-5, MEF2C expression initiated cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. These findings indicate the presence of a positive regulatory network between Nkx2-5 and MEF2C and show that both factors can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.</str>

      <str>The notochord is a structure present in all chordates and its development requires the transcription of Brachyury. While previous studies have shown that Brachyury is essential for notochord formation in vertebrate embryos, this gene is also expressed during the embryogenesis of nonchordate deuterostomes, hemichordates and echinoderms. Here we report that nonchordate deuterostome Brachyury genes can trigger the differentiation of extra notochord cells when these genes are ectopically expressed in ascidian embryos. The 2.6 kb upstream region of fork head gene (Ci-fkh) of Ciona intestinalis promotes the tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in endoderm, notochord and nerve cord. By taking advantage of this promoter, we misexpressed the Brachyury gene of ascidian (Ci-Bra), cephalochordate amphioxus (Am(Bb)Bra2), hemichordate acorn worm (PfBra), and echinoderm sea urchin (SpBra), in Ciona embryos. The misexpression of not only the chordate Brachyury, but also the nonchordate deuterostome Brachyury, resulted in the transformation of presumptive endodermal cells into notochord cells. This was confirmed by in situ hybridization experiments using four different notochord-specific probes from Ciona that have different temporal expression patterns. RT-PCR analyses indicated that Ci-Bra was not upregulated by the product of Am(Bb)Bra2, PfBra or SpBra. In situ hybridization showed no ectopic expression of Ci-Bra in the manipulated embryos. These results suggest that the introduction of nonchordate deuterostome Brachyury genes into ascidian embryos can trigger the differentiation of notochord cells in ascidian embryos. Evolutionary alteration in the genetic circuitry, especially downstream of this transcription factor, seems critical for the evolution of notochord and chordate body plan.</str>

ES cells specifically respond to Wnt signal as monitored by GFP expression. In GFP-positive ES cells we observe expression of Brachyury. Two TCF binding sites located in a 500 bp Brachyury promoter fragment bind the LEF-1/beta-catenin complex and respond specifically to beta-catenin-dependent transactivation. From these results we conclude that Brachyury is a target gene for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.</str>

Here we analyzed the expression of Brachyury (Pg-Bra) in the arrow worm Paraspadella gotoi and showed that Pg-Bra is expressed in the blastopore region and the stomodeum region in the embryo and then around the mouth opening region at the time of hatching. The expression of Pg-Bra in the embryo resembles that of Brachyury in embryos of hemichordates and echinoderms, whereas that in the mouth opening region in the hatchling appears to be novel.</str>

This particular high risk group cannot be identified properly as no marker exists to identify these patients. As the Wnt/Win pathway plays a crucial role in metastasis formation in colorectal carcinoma, we analysed whether the transcription factor brachyury critically involved in this pathway may predict metastasis formation in these patients. The expression of brachyury-homologous (T) was immunohistochemically analysed in 748 patients and the data were correlated with classical and newer prognostic markers in colorectal cancer. Early stages colorectal cancer patients (T1-2N0M0, Dukes A) showed a significantly decreased survival when brachyury was expressed in the tumour tissue while no correlation was observed in later tumour stages. Hence a subset of colorectal cancers exists in which the ability to metastasise is already present at early stages of tumour growth and this high risk group can now be detected by immunohistochemistry.</str>

      <str>The prevalent model for the generation of axial polarity in mouse embryos proposes that a radial to a linear transition in the expression of primitive streak markers precedes the formation of the primitive streak on one side of the epiblast. This model contrasts with the models of mesoderm formation in other vertebrates as it suggests that the primitive streak is initially established in a radial pattern rather than a localized region of the epiblast. Here, we examine the proposed correlation between the expression of Brachyury and Wnt3, two genes reported as expressed radially in the proximal epiblast, with the movements of proximal anterior epiblast cells at stages leading to the formation of the primitive streak. Our results reveal that neither Brachyury nor Wnt3 forms a ring of expression in the proximal epiblast as previously thought. In embryos dissected between 5.5 and 6.5 dpc, Brachyury is first expressed in the distal extra-embryonic ectoderm and subsequently on one side of the epiblast. Wnt3 expression is evident first in the posterior visceral endoderm of 5.5 dpc embryos and later in the posterior epiblast. Lineage analysis shows that the movements of the proximal epiblast do not restrict Brachyury expression to the posterior epiblast. Our data suggest a model whereby the localized expression of these genes in the posterior epiblast, and hence the formation of the primitive streak, is the result of local cell-cell interactions in the future posterior portion of the egg cylinder rather than regionalization of a radial pattern of expression in proximal epiblast cells.</str>

      <str>We have isolated the novel murine Sax-1 gene, a member of the NK-1 class of homeobox genes, and report its expression pattern in the developing central nervous system (CNS) in comparison to two other homeobox genes, Evx-1 and Pax-6. Sax-1 was found to be transiently expressed in the developing posterior CNS. First seen in the ectoderm lateral to the primitive streak, the signal later encompassed the neural plate. Posteriorly, the expression domain overlapped with the Evx-1 expression in the streak, while anteriorly it was delimited by the Pax-6 signal in the neural tube. This early phase starting at day 9.5 pc, Sax-1 was expressed in distinct areas of spinal cord, hindbrain and forebrain. Particularly strong signals were detected in rhombomere 1 and in the pretectum. In these areas, subsets of neurons may be marked and specified. In addition to the normal pattern of Sax-1 during development, the expression in different mouse mutants was analysed. In Brachyury curtailed homozygotes, the expression of Sax-1 was found to be reduced during neurulation and even lost at day 9.0 pc. Ventral shift and finally loss of the signal in the ventral spinal cord was observed in Danforth's short tail homozygotes.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a tumor of the axial skeleton that is distinctly uncommon in children and adolescents. Previous observations have suggested that chordomas in pediatric patients differ from adult chordomas in presentation, morphology, and behavior. This study examines the clinical and histologic features of chordomas in young patients (&lt; or =25 years old). All cases from the Mayo Clinic files were graphed according to age and a bimodal distribution was observed. The 35 cases representing the youngest population were selected for review. Histopathology ranged from low cellularity tumors with lobulated architecture and abundant myxoid matrix (conventional chordoma), to those with varying amounts of chondroid matrix (chondroid chordoma), to more cellular tumors (atypical chordoma), and finally to neoplasms with high-grade spindle-cell differentiation (dedifferentiated chordoma). Over an average follow-up period of 129 months (range 1 to 501 months), there were 13 deaths (37%) and 3 patients with metastasis. This survival rate was slightly better than the reported mortality rate for adults with chordoma, but there was a subset of young patients (those with atypical chordoma) that had a significantly worse survival rate, suggesting that histologic subtyping may be predictive of prognosis.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare tumor with slow growth developing from remnants of the notochord and thus appears in close relation to the axial skeleton. A Swedish national series collected over a period of 13 years, comprising 51 patients with a follow-up time of 8-20 years, was studied. Histologically all tumors had a typical appearance except two, which had characteristics of "chondroid chordoma". Fifty-seven per cent of the tumors were located in the sacrococcygeal region, 27 per cent in the spheno-occipital region and 16 per cent in the vertebrae. The peak age incidence was in the 6th and 7th decades. Male: female ratio was 1:1. The main symptoms were pain and neurologic disturbances. Skeletal destruction was noted radiographically in most instances. Intratumoral calcifications were rarely seen. The treatment was surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of these. There was only one long-term survivor without evidence of disease, a patient operated on for cervical chordoma 14 years earlier. Six other patients lived 8-18 years after diagnosis with chordoma. All other patients were dead; 39 died of chordoma, five of unrelated causes. Distant metastases were noted in 29 per cent. Chordoma constituted 17.5 per cent of all primary malignant bone tumors of the axial skeleton. The yearly incidence was 0.51 per million inhabitants in Sweden.</str>

      <str>Two cases of sacral chordoma in a 7-year, 9-month-old boy and a 3-year, 4-month-old boy are presented. In addition to the typical histology of conventional chordoma, both tumors showed the less differentiated sarcomatoid appearance of atypical chordoma in the major portion. Immunohistochemically, in both cases neoplastic cells in areas of conventional as well as atypical chordoma were positive for keratins (CAM 5.2, AE1 and AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, S-100 protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Both patients underwent resection of the tumor and chemotherapy. In comparison with conventional chordomas in adults, however, these two tumors showed more aggressive clinical course and were less amenable to therapeutic control. The older boy died of multiple metastasis 1 year after initial diagnosis. At the last follow-up, 15 months after initial diagnosis, the younger boy was alive, but with recurrent and metastatic disease of the left parasacral area and chest wall. Our studies of these two cases and the reported cases suggest that sacral chordoma in children has distinctive clinicopathologic features denoting a highly aggressive tumor and that it should be treated as such.</str>

      <str>More than 550 million years ago, chordates originated from a common ancestor shared with nonchordate deuterostomes by developing a novel type of larva, the "tadpole larva." The notochord is the supporting organ of the larval tail and the most prominent feature of chordates; indeed, phylum Chordata is named after this organ. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the notochord over the course of chordate evolution with a special emphasis on a member of T-box gene family, Brachyury. Comparison of the decoded genome of a unicellular choanoflagellate with the genomes of sponge and cnidarians suggests that T-box gene family arose at the time of the evolution of multicellular animals. Gastrulation is a morphogenetic movement that is essential for the formation of two- or three-germ-layered embryos. Brachyury is transiently expressed in the blastopore (bp) region, where it confers on cells the ability to undergo invagination. This process is involved in the formation of the archenteron in all metazoans. This is a "primary" function of Brachyury. During the evolution of chordates, Brachyury gained an additional expression domain at the dorsal midline region of the bp. In this new expression domain, Brachyury served its "secondary" function, recruiting another set of target genes to form a dorsal axial organ, notochord. The Wnt/β-catenin, BMP/Nodal, and FGF-signaling pathways are involved in the transcriptional activation of Brachyury. We discuss the molecular mechanisms of Brachyury secondary function in the context of the dorsal-ventral (D-V) inversion theory and the aboral-dorsalization hypothesis. Although the scope of this review requires some degree of oversimplification of Brachyury function, it is beneficial to facilitate studies on the notochord formation, a central evolutionary developmental biology problem in the history of metazoan evolution, pointed out first by Alexander Kowalevsky.</str>

      <str>The homeobox gene goosecoid, originally identified in Xenopus, is expressed in the organizer or its equivalent during gastrulation in the frog, chick, zebrafish and mouse. To investigate the role of goosecoid in mouse development, we have generated embryonic stem cells that stably overexpress the murine homolog of goosecoid. These cells show a repression of the gastrulation-associated gene Brachyury. Interestingly, repression of Brachyury is conserved between Xenopus and mouse despite the lack of conservation of the Brachyury promoter. Further characterization of the goosecoid-overexpressing ES cells revealed that they maintain the expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, and teratomas derived from goosecoid-overexpressing cells show the presence of cell types derived from all three germ layers. Some highly chimeric mice derived from goosecoid-overexpressing cells displayed skull defects. These observations suggest that goosecoid may play a role in specification of anterior mesendodermal fates and specifically in mouse craniofacial development.</str>

      <str>Our objectives were to determine the chondrogenic potential of a murine Brachyury-transformed mesenchymal progenitor cell line in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis-activated synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Brachyury-transformed mesenchymal progenitor cells were implanted alone or combined with RASFs isolated from diseased human joints in each of six immunodeficient SCID mice. De novo tissue formation was analysed by histology and immunohistochemistry after 60 days. Spheroid nodules resembling cartilage morphologically and by the expression of proteoglycans and collagen II developed in four of six implants in the absence and in five of six implants in the presence of RASFs. No evidence for hypertrophic differentiation could be observed. Mesenchymal progenitor cells transformed with Brachyury are able to produce a cartilage like tissue in vivo over an extended period of time that is resistant to the destructive effect of RASF. This observation may provide opportunities for a cell-based reconstructive treatment in joint disease.</str>

      <str>Urothelial carcinoma is morphologically heterogeneous and many variant forms have been described. We have encountered several invasive urothelial carcinomas with a unique chordoid morphology characterized by prominent cellular cording and associated myxoid stromal matrix, a pattern closely resembling extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. This morphologic appearance, to our knowledge, has not been formally described in urothelial carcinoma. A series of 166 consecutive invasive urothelial carcinomas were reviewed to identify cases with cellular cording and myxoid stroma. The patient age, sex, tumor stage, morphologic features, association with typical urothelial carcinoma, and clinical outcome were recorded. Immunostains for p63, cytokeratin (CK) 34BE12, CK20, calponin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, oncofetal protein glypican-3, and brachyury were performed on 7 cases. Mucin histochemistry was performed on 8 cases to evaluate the extracellular myxoid material. Eleven of the 166 (7%) consecutive invasive urothelial carcinomas had areas with a chordoid appearance. A total of 12 cases were analyzed including the addition of a consult case. The patients' ages ranged from 50 to 85 years (mean: 68 y); there were 8 males and 4 females. The specimens consisted of 5 cystectomies, 6 transurethral resections, and 1 anterior exenteration with right nephroureterectomy. Morphologically, each case had at least focal areas in which acellular myxoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells. When well developed, the neoplastic cells had scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and were arranged into cords closely mimicking extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, chordoma, mixed tumor/myoepithelioma of soft tissue, and yolk sac tumor. The percentage of tumor with a chordoid appearance ranged from 5% to 95% (mean: 39%; median: 25%). No conventional sarcomatous differentiation, no intracytoplasmic mucin, and no glandular formation were present in any case. All 12 cases had foci of typical urothelial carcinoma present at least focally and a gradual transition to the chordoid pattern was commonly seen. Immunophenotypically, all 7 cases evaluated showed strong immunoreactivity for p63 (nuclear) and CK34BE12 (cytoplasmic). Immunostains for CK20, calponin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, oncofetal protein glypican-3, and brachyury and were negative in the 7 cases studied (0 out of 7), whereas S-100 protein had focal staining (&lt;5%) in 1 case. The myxoid stromal component was diffusely colloidal iron and Alcian blue positive in all 8 cases examined; periodic acid Schiff was negative in all 8 cases, whereas mucicarmine was only focally positive in 2 of 8 cases. Most cases were high stage (pT4: 5, pT3: 4, pT2: 2, and pT1: 1), and 6 of 8 cases (75%) with nodal sampling had metastatic disease. In 1 case, the lymph node metastasis had areas with chordoid morphology. Nine of 12 patients had available follow-up: 2 were dead of disease (1 and 10 mo), 4 were alive with disease (5 to 8 mo) with distant metastasis in 3, and 3 had no evidence of disease at last follow-up (2 to 120 mo). In summary, we describe a morphologic pattern of urothelial carcinoma with a distinct chordoid appearance that may potentially mimic a spectrum of primary vesical and nonvesical neoplasms with myxoid or mucinous components. These carcinomas maintain an immunophenotype characteristic of urothelial carcinoma and usually present with high stage disease.</str>

      <str>Expression of the transcription factor genes brachyury, Tbx2/3 and sall is characterized in detail for the first time in an indirectly developing spiralian with a feeding trochophore. In Hydroides elegans, gut formation proceeds by invagination during embryogenesis and is followed by feeding-dependent posterior growth during larval stages. Posterior growth gives rise to the reproductive and segmented portion of the adult and derives primarily from multipotent dorsal blastomeres. Dorsal fate becomes morphologically evident at the 60-cell stage during spiral cleavage, although the timing of dorsal specification remains uncertain. Expression of brachyury anticipates the morphogenetic events associated with both gastrulation by invagination in the endoderm and ventral midline convergent extension in the ectoderm. The absence of brachyury expression in endoderm precursors previously reported in annelids that do not have feeding larvae suggests evolutionarily conserved roles associated with morphogenesis rather than endoderm specification. Synexpression of brachyury and FoxA in the blastopore of eumetazoans as well as in the secondarily formed anus of some protostomes and the mouth of deuterostomes suggests shared regulatory circuits during the formation of both oral and anal openings in protostomes and deuterostomes. Expression of sall during gastrulation, in the protonephridium, and in posterior growth zone precursors, also suggests evolutionarily conserved roles. The dorsal sides of the Hydroides and sea urchin embryos express Tbx2/3 in all three germ layer precursors, suggesting evolutionarily conserved dorsal regionalization functions. The results suggest specific gene usage during tubular gut formation, endoderm specification, dorsoventral specification and anteroposterior body elongation in the context of development by feeding larva.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor gene Brachyury is important for the differentiation of notochord in all chordates, including the ascidians Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis. We isolated Brachyury from molgulid ascidians, which have evolved tailless larvae multiple times independently, and found the genes appear functional by cDNA sequence analyses. We then compared the expression of Mocu-Bra in tailed Molgula oculata embryos to two tailless species, Molgula occulta (Mocc-Bra) and Molgula tectiformis (Mt-Bra). Here we show that both tailless species express Brachyury in the notochord lineage during embryogenesis. Initial expression of Mocu-Bra is normal in tailed M. oculata embryos; 10 precursor notochord cells divide twice to result in 40 notochord cells that converge and extend to make a notochord down the center of the tail. In contrast, in tailless Molgula occulta, Mocc-Bra expression disappears prematurely, and there is only one round of division, resulting in 20 cells in the final notochord lineage that never converge or extend. In M. occulta x M. oculata hybrid embryos, expression of Mocu-Bra is prolonged, and the embryos form a tail with 20 notochord cells that converge and extend normally. However, in Molgula tectiformis, a different tailless ascidian, Mt-Bra was expressed only in the 10 notochord precursor cells, which never divide, converge, or extend. In summary, neither Brachyury function nor the early establishment of the notochord lineage appears to be impaired in tailless embryos. In light of these results, we are continuing to investigate how and why notochord development is lost in tailless molgulid ascidian embryos.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a member of the T-box gene family, is required for posterior mesoderm and notochord differentiation in vertebrate development, and mis-expression of Xenopus Brachyury causes ectopic mesoderm formation. Brachyury is a transcription activator, and its ability to activate transcription is essential for its biological function, but Brachyury target genes have proved difficult to identify. Here we employ a hormone-inducible Brachyury construct and subtractive hybridization to search for such targets. Using this approach we have isolated Bix1, a homeobox gene expressed both in the marginal zone of Xenopus and in the vegetal hemisphere. Expression of Bix1 is induced in an immediate-early fashion by mesoderm-inducing factors such as activin as well as by the products of the T-box genes Xbra and VegT (also known as Antipodean, Brat and Xombi). Activation of Bix1 in response to Xbra is direct in the sense that it does not require protein synthesis, and both Xbra and VegT activate expression of a reporter gene driven by the Bix 5' regulatory region, which contains an Xbra/VegT binding site. Mis-expression of low levels of Bix1 causes formation of ventral mesoderm, while high levels induce endodermal differentiation. These results suggest that Bix1 acts downstream of both VegT and Xbra to induce formation of mesoderm and endoderm.</str>

In addition, this approach has the advantages of quick recovery, avoidance of catastrophic complications and sequelae. Especially, various angle view of the endoscope provides a panoramic view of the hypo-clivus, thus exposing and resecting hide lesion which can not be exposed by other approaches. This approach might facilitate complete resection of the chordoma with maximal preservation of normal tissues.</str>

      <str>A patient who received radiation therapy for a sacral lesion 10 years ago and eventually developed dedifferentiated chordoma at the primary site is reported. Initially, the patient received 54 Gy with Co-60 to the sacral tumor, and 6 years later an additional 50 Gy with 10 MV X-rays to the local recurrence. Four years later, an evident sacral tumor was noticed. When readmitted for re-confirmation of histology, a large rapidly growing lung metastasis was observed. The patient eventually died of progressive disease with incidental aspiration pneumonia. At autopsy, 10 years after the initial treatment, the recurrent sacral tumor proved to be dedifferentiated chordoma accompanied by typical chordoma. Although this case suggests the possible malignant transformation of chordoma rather than collision, the factors inducing this change remain unknown.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury family of T-domain containing transcription factor has been recently the subject of a number of Evo-Devo studies, with expression data obtained from a wide sampling of eumetazans, pointing to a possible conserved role in the formation of the blastopore and the extremities of the digestive tract. Here we present a comparative analysis of Brachyury sequences at the metazoan scale, using published data and two new sponge Brachyury sequences. Alignment features, gene phylogeny, and the evolution of variable positions within the T-domain are discussed in the light of available data about functional constraints on the residues. Interestingly, the high sequence divergence observed in Brachyury T-domains from sponges appears to be mostly the consequence of autapomorphic changes within the sponge lineages, rather than the retention of primitive character states.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumors primarily involving both ends of the axial skeleton that present as destructive bone lesions with a large soft tissue mass. Chordomas were previously believed to arise from notochordal remnants. However, recent studies suggest the possibility that chordomas arise from benign notochordal cell tumors. We present two cases of coccygeal incipient chordoma that strengthen the new hypothesis. The first case was an 83-year-old man who died of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The second case was a 79-year-old man who died of hepatocellular carcinoma. The coccygeal tumors were composed of intraosseous and extraosseous infiltrative lesions. The intraosseous lesions consisted of both benign notochordal cell tumor and incipient chordoma. The extraosseous lesions were consistent with incipient chordoma. In addition, two other small benign notochordal cell tumors were found at a different level in case 1. It is conceivable that pre-existing intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumors transform into incipient chordoma and then extend through the cortex into the surrounding soft tissue. The incidence of incipient chordoma appears much higher than expected because chordomas are rare tumors with an incidence of one case per 1 000 000 persons per year. We suspect that unknown factors transform incipient chordoma into classic chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chordomas arise from primitive notochordal remnants. Why these notochordal remnants undergo malignant transformation to chordoma remains unknown. The binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor promotes cell survival, while its binding to the p75 receptor triggers apoptosis. If there is simultaneous expression of both receptors, the effect of TrkA supersedes and the cells survive.</str>
      <str>We examined 10 surgically obtained sacral chordoma tissue samples to determine the expressions of NGF and TrkA and p75 receptors as well as markers of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. As controls, we used notochordal cells of L4-L5 discs obtained from ten 1-month old rats. We quantified the expressions of NGF and TrkA and p75 receptors as well as markers of cellular proliferation and apoptosis for both groups, respectively.</str>
      <str>Chordoma and notochordal cells both expressed NGF as well as TrkA and p75 receptors. While the mean percentage of p75 receptor expression was very similar between chordoma and notochordal cells (P = 0.394), the mean percentages of TrkA and NGF expressions were significantly higher in chordoma cells than in notochordal cells (both P = 0.002). The mean proliferation potential index of chordoma cells was significantly higher than in notochordal cells (P &lt; 0.01). Conversely, the mean apoptosis index of chordoma cells was significantly lower compared with that of notochordal cells (P = 0.03).</str>

Macroscopically, it was a mass (20 mm in diameter) protruding into the retroperitoneum and the cut surface was white to dark-reddish and showed a gelatinous appearance. Histologically, the tumor was composed of physaliphorous and stellate cells growing in nests or cords and divided into lobules by a thin fibrous stroma. The tumor cells locally invaded adjacent tissues, but no metastasis to other organs was noted. Centrally, the tumor often had islands of bone that entrapped physaliphorous cells and the bone tissue consisted of well-differentiated osteocytes.

      <str>Intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumor is a presumably benign, intravertebral lesion of notochord origin, which can be found incidentally on removal of the vertebra for unrelated lesions or during an autopsy. The notion of a larger benign notochordal cell tumor that is macroscopic, occasionally symptomatic, and seen radiologically was recently introduced, and described as giant vertebral notochordal rest, giant notochordal hamartoma of intraosseous origin, and benign chordoma . Because of the location, size, and similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics, larger benign notochordal cell tumors are easily misdiagnosed as the malignant notochord-type of tumor/chordoma, with critical implications.

      <str>Members of the LEF-1/TCF family of transcription factors have been implicated in mediating a nuclear response to Wnt signals by association with beta-catenin. Consistent with this view, mice carrying mutations in either the Wnt3a gene or in both transcription factor genes Lef1 and Tcf1 were previously found to show a similar defect in the formation of paraxial mesoderm in the gastrulating mouse embryo. In addition, mutations in the Brachyury gene, a direct transcriptional target of LEF-1, were shown to result in mesodermal defects. However, direct evidence for the role of LEF-1 and Brachyury in Wnt3a signaling has been limiting. In this study, we genetically examine the function of LEF-1 in the regulation of Brachyury expression and in signaling by Wnt3a. Analysis of the expression of Brachyury in Lef1(-/-)Tcf1(-/-) mice and studies of Brachyury:lacZ transgenes containing wild type or mutated LEF-1 binding sites indicate that Lef1 is dispensable for the initiation, but is required for the maintenance of Brachyury expression. We also show that the expression of an activated form of LEF-1, containing the beta-catenin activation domain fused to the amino terminus of LEF-1, can rescue a Wnt3a mutation. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that Lef1 mediates the Wnt3a signal and regulates the stable maintenance of Brachyury expression during gastrulation.</str>

In addition to the typical areas of chordoma, pleomorphic areas resembling malignant fibrous histiocytoma also were seen in the fourth recurrence. The chordoma-like areas of the fourth recurrence displayed typical epithelial features: clusters of epithelial-like cells, electron microscopically demonstrable vacuoles lined by microvilli and desmosomes, and cytokeratin positivity in immunostaining. The areas in the fourth recurrence that resembled malignant fibrous histiocytoma lacked epithelial features as judged by electron microscopy. They also were negative for cytokeratin but contained, instead, vimentin type of intermediate filaments.

      <str>iMRI scan were performed in each operation from 1 time to 5 times. Neuronavigation system were used in 20 operations and the data renewed in 12 cases by the information from iMRI. In 15 of 23 patients, iMRI had revealed residual lesions and resulted in 12 cases further treatment, eventually, 9 tumors were totally removed and 3 tumors were further removed. The ratio of total removal tumor was enhanced to 73.9% (17/23) from 34.8% (8/23). Among 15 cases of partial chordoma removal detected by scanning in operation, 9 were huge chordoma. The residual of huge chordoma detected by scanning in operation was 9/11, and other chordoma contributed to 6/12. There were no iMRI related safety issue or accident recorded in this study.</str>

      <str>Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is crucial for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, namely the epiblast, embryonic stem, and embryonal carcinoma cells, into mesendoderm. However, downstream events of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that control the formation of mesendoderm are still unclear. In the present study, we used mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as a model, and identified a homeodomain protein Nkx1-2 as a key regulator of mesendoderm formation. In the mouse embryo, Nkx1-2 was expressed in the primitive streak, in which the nascent mesendoderm emerges. In P19 cells, the expression of Nkx1-2 was activated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling independently of Brachyury, an evolutionary conserved early mesendoderm gene. In contrast, the expression of Nkx1-2 was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of Brachyury. Nkx1-2 acted as a transcriptional repressor to mediate the action of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to activate the Brachyury expression. We found Tcf3 as a potential target of gene repression by Nkx1-2, and the down-regulation of Tcf3 was partly required for effective activation of Brachyury by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These results suggest that Nkx1-2 is a critical component of the gene regulatory network that operates downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to regulate the formation of mesendoderm.</str>

      <str>In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Wnt-responsive development-related genes are silenced to maintain pluripotency and their expression is activated during differentiation. Acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases stimulates transcription, whereas deacetylation of histones by HDACs is correlated with transcriptional repression. Although Wnt-mediated gene transcription has been intimately linked to the acetylation or deacetylation of histones, how Wnt signaling regulates this type of histone modification is poorly understood. Here, we report that Smek, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex, plays an important role in histone deacetylation and silencing of the Wnt-responsive gene, brachyury, in ESCs. Smek mediates recruitment of PP4c and HDAC1 to the Tcf/Lef binding site of the brachyury promoter and inhibits brachyury expression in ESCs. Activation of Wnt signaling during differentiation causes disruption of the Smek/PP4c/HDAC1 complex, resulting in an increase in histones H3 and H4 acetylation at the brachyury gene locus. These results suggest that the Smek-containing PP4 complex represses transcription of Wnt-responsive development-related genes through histone deacetylation, and that this complex is essential for ESC pluripotency maintenance.</str>

The smears showed clumps and small cords of polygonal tumor cells containing bubbly cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei. Focally, there were also aggregates of long filamentous spindle cells and stellate bizarre cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism. Occasional tumor cells were seen in association with dense amorphous material. Histologic examination of the excised specimen showed features of the so-called "sarcomatoid" chordoma which consisted of prominent foci of mitotically inactive spindle and pleomorphic cells, in addition to the conventional chordoma areas. An osteosarcoma-like pattern of probably metaplastic nature was also seen within the tumor. Immunohistochemical study showed that most tumor cells expressed cytokeratins. Ultrastructural examination revealed the characteristic rough endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria complexes. While there are many spindle and pleomorphic cells seen in crush preparations, the distinction from other true high-grade malignancies is important. Recognition of these "pseudoanaplastic" cytologic features also helps to expand the morphologic spectrum of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is considered to be a malignant, fatal tumor. According to most authors it constitutes between 1-4% of all malignant bone tumors. In 50% of the cases it is located in the sacrum, in 35% in the cervical spine and skull, and in 15% in the thoracic spine and elsewhere. It is an aggressive, locally invasive, slowly-growing tumor. Although metastases are rare, when they occur they are of an anaplastic type, especially in the lungs, liver, regional lymph nodes, skin and muscles. Chordoma is a rare tumor, and its location and slow growth often result in delayed diagnosis. Complete excision of the chordoma was formerly considered impossible. There is often local recurrence, and often, by its very nature, excision results in neurological defects. Lately, there is more optimism regarding complete cure, due to more advanced surgical methods. We present a 66-year-old man in whom a tumor developed in the sacrococcygeal area and the right buttock. The tumor was diagnosed by CT, MRI and biopsy as a chordoma of the sacrum, without intra-abdominal infiltration. He was operated through a posterior approach, with complete resection of the tumor, including almost the whole sacrum and the coccyx. We consider this approach simpler than the abdominal-dorsal approach, which in cases of intra-abdominal infiltration is necessary. We regard this simple incision as a significant advance in the treatment of this condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>The high rates of embryonic mortalities which follow in vitro production of ruminant embryos have emphasized the need for increased knowledge of early development. It is likely that early failures in embryonic development and placenta formation involve abnormal differentiation of mesoderm. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of expression of two T-box genes known to control the gastrulation process, Brachyury and Eomesodermin, by whole-mount in situ hybridization. To allow a more precise comparison of both expression patterns between embryos, we describe a new staging of pre-implanted ovine embryos by gross morphology and histology from pre-gastrulation stages to the beginning of neurulation. In pre-streak embryos primitive mesoderm cells delaminated in between the primitive endoderm and the epiblast. At that stage, no expression of Brachyury or Eomesodermin could be detected in the embryos. Early expression of both T-genes was observed by the early-streak stages in epiblast cells located close to the presumptive posterior pole of the embryos. Later on, during gastrulation both genes followed a pattern of expression similar to the ones described in other mammals. These observations suggest that other genes, which remain to be identified, are responsible for extra-embryonic mesoderm differentiation in ruminant embryos.</str>

      <str>The expression of Brachyury (Bra) during development of Colostethus machalilla was analyzed with a polyclonal antibody. The observed molecular mass of Bra was of 48 kDa, as in Xenopus laevis. During cleavage, low levels of Bra were expressed. In contrast, in the blastula Bra became up-regulated, and Bra protein was present in a wide ring of surface cells. The surface expression of Bra disappeared in the gastrula, and a new ring of Bra-positive nuclei was detected in deep cells around the closing blastopore. The C. machalilla external and internal rings of Bra-positive nuclei apparently mark the prospective mesoderm in the blastula and gastrula, respectively. The two Bra expression rings were dissociated in time in the fairly slow developing embryos of this frog. Brachyury expression in the notochord became visible only after the blastopore closed, in contrast with X. laevis. In addition, Bra expression in the notochord indicated that dorsal convergence and extension occurred after blastopore closure. The C. machalilla Bra-positive notochord was originally exposed on the gastrocoel roof, in agreement with a superficial component of the prospective mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Chordoma, a primary malignant neoplasm of the cerebro-spinal axis, is difficult to diagnose and impossible to cure. The only effective treatment is early radical surgical removal, regardless of its size or location. A giant, 65gm tumor arising from the clivus, C1 and C2 vertebrae was successfully removed with low morbidity. The surgical technique is described and compared to other operations with their advantages and disadvantages. A plea is made for surgical removal as the initial treatment for these lesions to prevent fatal intracranial metastasis.</str>

Initially, only adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. The treatment consisted of endoscopic endonasal surgery followed by conventional radiotherapy. After 18 months, a local recurrence was diagnosed after a facial trauma, but the true histology was difficult to assess. The tumor was dual, associating adenocarcinoma and chondroid chordoma, with atypical localization in the ethmoid. Further evolution was particularly aggressive.

      <str>The appendicularian Oikopleura dioica is a chordate that has a remarkably simple adult body with small cell number. Its transparency, stereotyped cell lineages, short life cycle, and small genome make it a promising new experimental model of chordate developmental biology. However, the functions of its various genes are still poorly understood due to lack of a tool for suppression of gene expression. Here, we applied a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based-RNA interference (RNAi) method in O. dioica. For introducing dsRNA into eggs and embryos, we injected dsRNAs into the ovary. dsRNA, which is specific to EGFP or mCherry mRNA, decreased the exogenous mRNA-derived fluorescence in both eggs and embryos. dsRNA specific to the Brachyury gene of O. dioica, which is a homologous gene of a key notochord transcriptional factor in ascidians, triggered degradation of endogenous Brachyury mRNA and induced malformation or loss of the notochord in the tail. This effect was Brachyury sequence specific, as three dsRNAs covering different sequences produced the same phenotype. The result is in accordance with its expression site and also with the key regulatory function of Brachyury in notochord formation in other chordates. RNAi in O. dioica would be a useful tool for gaining insight into the oogenesis and early developmental processes in chordates.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of notochord origin that occurs along the craniospinal axis, and extranotochordal chordoma is extremely unusual. An aberrant origin of this neoplasm can pose diagnostic pitfalls. We report a case of primary cervical chordoma of extranotochordal origin clinically presenting as a thyroid neoplasm. The cytomorphologic features of chordoma and its cytologic differential diagnoses are discussed.</str>
      <str>An 82-year-old man presented with hoarseness of voice and difficulty in swallowing. He had a mass in the anterolateral aspect of the right side of the neck. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with contrast study revealed an ill-defined, contrast-enhancing tumor mass located in the right retrolaryngeal and parapharyngeal space at the level of C4, invading the perithyroidal soft tissue. Aspiration biopsy cytology of the tumor demonstrated epithelial-like cells with varied cytomorphologic features causing differential diagnostic problems with thyroid and soft tissue. However, the diagnosis of extranotochordal chordoma was established by the subsequent histologic examination of the excisional biopsy specimen.</str>
      <str>Since chordoma is capable of exhibiting a spectrum of cytomorphologic characteristics and can have cytologic features overlapping with other malignant neoplasms, a high index of suspicion is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis on fine needle aspiration biopsy. This case highlights the occurrence of a rare neoplasm at an aberrant site and the diagnostic challenges that can pose. However, awareness of the abnormal locations and characteristic cytomorphologic features of chordoma together with radiologic findings will usually keep the cytopathologist from making a wrong diagnosis.</str>

      <str>I isolated a Ciona intestinalis homolog of p53, Ci-p53/p73-a, in a microarray screen of rapidly degraded maternal mRNA by comparing the transcriptomes of unfertilized eggs and 32-cell stage embryos. Higher expression of the gene in eggs and lower expression in later embryonic stages were confirmed by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR); expression was ubiquitous in eggs and early embryos. Knockdown of Ci-p53/p73-a by injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) severely perturbed gastrulation cell movements and expression of notochord marker genes. A key regulator of notochord differentiation in Ciona embryos is Brachyury (Ci-Bra), which is directly activated by a zic-like gene (Ci-ZicL). The expression of Ci-ZicL and Ci-Bra in A-line notochord precursors was downregulated in Ci-p53/p73-a knockdown embryos. Maternal expression of Ci-p53/p73-b, a homolog of Ci-p53/p73-a, was also detected. In Ci-p53/p73-b knockdown embryos, gastrulation cell movements, expression of Ci-ZicL and Ci-Bra in A-line notochord precursors, and expression of notochord marker gene at later stages were perturbed. The upstream region of Ci-ZicL contains putative p53-binding sites. Cis-regulatory analysis of Ci-ZicL showed that these sites are involved in expression of Ci-ZicL in A-line notochord precursors at the 32-cell and early gastrula stages. These results suggest that p53 genes are maternal factors that play a crucial role in A-line notochord differentiation in C. intestinalis embryos by regulating Ci-ZicL expression.</str>

      <str>The classical sacrococcygeal chordoma tumor presents with a typical morphology of lobulated myxoid tumor tissue with cords, strands and nests of tumor cells. The population of cells consists of small non-vacuolated cells, intermediate cells with a wide range of vacuolization and large heavily vacuolated (physaliferous) cells. To date analysis was only performed on bulk tumor mass because of its rare incidence, lack of suited model systems and technical limitations thereby neglecting its heterogeneous composition. We intended to clarify whether the observed cell types are derived from genetically distinct clones or represent different phenotypes. Furthermore, we aimed at elucidating the differences between small non-vacuolated and large physaliferous cells on the genomic and transcriptomic level. Phenotype-specific analyses of small non-vacuolated and large physaliferous cells in two independent chordoma cell lines yielded four candidate genes involved in chordoma cell development. UCHL3, coding for an ubiquitin hydrolase, was found to be over-expressed in the large physaliferous cell phenotype of MUG-Chor1 (18.7-fold) and U-CH1 (3.7-fold) cells. The mannosyltransferase ALG11 (695-fold) and the phosphatase subunit PPP2CB (18.6-fold) were found to be up-regulated in large physaliferous MUG-Chor1 cells showing a similar trend in U-CH1 cells. TMEM144, an orphan 10-transmembrane family receptor, yielded contradictory data as cDNA microarray analysis showed up- but RT-qPCR data down-regulation in large physaliferous MUG-Chor1 cells. Isolation of few but morphologically identical cells allowed us to overcome the limitations of bulk analysis in chordoma research. We identified the different chordoma cell phenotypes to be part of a developmental process and discovered new genes linked to chordoma cell development representing potential targets for further research in chordoma tumor biology. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare neoplasms arising along the axial skeleton. Up to now, the most suitable therapeutic approach is based on a combination of surgical excision and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy in not applied due to its reported low efficacy. Recently, evidence on the efficacy of Imatinib mesylate in two patients has been reported. We analyzed 14 chordoma samples for the expression of the Imatinib mesylate targets by means of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry and found that PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta are in some cases expressed in neoplastic cells, while the stromal counterpart of the same tumor shows the above receptors. Findings on the PDGFA/PDGFB expression suggest a receptor-activated status. Our study provides new insights into the specific localization of Imatinib mesylate targets in skull base chordomas that could be taken into account for the setting up of a pharmacological treatment for this tumor.</str>

      <str>Three cases of "dedifferentiated" chordoma arising in the sacrococcygeal region are presented. In all three cases, the "dedifferentiated" component arose de novo in conjunction with conventional chordoma. Two of these patients, whose tumors had a prominent malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) component, died within 6 months of diagnosis. Both patients had lung metastases, one of which was histologically documented to be MFH. The third patient, whose initial tumor contained osteosarcoma, died 76 months after diagnosis and multiple recurrences. Most notable in this case was the absence of the "dedifferentiated" component (in this instance, osteosarcoma) in all of the local recurrences as well as the lung metastases. These were composed exclusively of conventional chordoma. None of the patients had a previous history of radiation therapy. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of conventional chordoma was similar to that of previous reports, where the epithelial-like cells stained for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. In addition, they stained for alpha-1-anti-chymotrypsin and vimentin. These latter two markers were also identified in the "dedifferentiated" component. As with "dedifferentiated" chondrosarcomas and liposarcomas, "dedifferentiation" in a chordoma usually portends an accelerated clinical course.</str>

      <str>Clinical, radiological, and pathologic features of an intracranial chondroid chordoma in a 9-year-old boy are described. This is the first reported case of a chordoma, the center of which was laterally situated in the cranial base, lying in or near jugular foramen and carotid canal, but without midline involvement. Although cranial chordomas in childhood are extremely rare, and all previously reported cases appeared to have arisen in the clivus, this location should not be considered ectopic. Forking at the rostral end of the notochord has been demonstrated in embryos, and would be the presumed embryological source for this tumor. This is also the first reported case of a chondroid chordoma in a child with immunohistochemical documentation distinguishing it from a chondrosarcoma. This chondroid chordoma contained two populations of cells: neoplastic cartilage and chordoid tissue in a myxoid stroma.

      <str>A 44-year-old woman presented with a thoracic chordoma with intrathoracic extension manifesting as complaints of lower extremity weakness, hypesthesia below the levels of T5-6, and sphincter incontinence. Almost total resection combined with anterior interbody fusion and stabilization was possible through a left transpleural transthoracic approach. She suffered recurrence after 2 years and was considered inoperable. Biopsy revealed a malignant chordoma with no sarcomatous differentiation. Chordoma is an uncommon malignant bone tumor originating from remnants of the embryonal notochord, occurring mostly along the axial skeleton, at the extremity of the vertebral spine, and is least common in the thoracic region. Differential diagnosis is problematic and biopsy is helpful particularly if considered inoperable. Thoracic chordomas of the malignant type manifest as cord or root compression. Classical malignant chordomas must be distinguished from chondroid, benign, or other types of chordomas, since the biological behavior and clinical features are distinct. However, the differential diagnosis cannot be based on histological examination, but long-term follow up is required. Most patients have extradural and intraspinal tissue extension at the time of diagnosis, which makes complete resection impossible. Aggressive surgery without violation of surgical borders is the best choice in the treatment of thoracic chordoma. Thoracic chordoma is a recurring neoplasm and is prone to dissemination and sarcomatous differentiation despite its slow-growing nature.</str>

The original conventional chordoma was treated postoperatively with external beam radiation therapy, and the patient was free of disease until he presented at the age of 71 with leg weakness. Computerized tomography revealed a lumbo-sacral soft tissue mass. This was excised and found to have three distinct histologic aspects. The largest component was that of a conventional chordoma. The second component consisted of islands of malignant cartilage intimately admixed with the cells of the conventional chordoma. The third component consisted of high-grade malignant, poorly differentiated spindle cells.

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for mesoderm formation in the mouse. In this paper we describe the cloning and expression of a Xenopus homolog of Brachyury, Xbra. As with Brachyury in the mouse, Xbra is expressed in presumptive mesodermal cells around the blastopore, and then in the notochord. We show that expression of Xbra occurs as a result of mesoderm induction in Xenopus, both in response to the natural signal and in response to the mesoderm-inducing factors activin A and basic FGF. Expression of Xbra in response to these factors is rapid, and will occur in dispersed cells and in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, indicating that this is an "immediate-early" response to mesoderm induction.</str>

To our knowledge, this tumor has not been previously described in the nasal septum as a primary lesion. We describe a 39-year-old woman who presented with a 1-year history of nasal obstruction. Results of her physical examination and imaging studies demonstrated a nasoseptal mass. We also discuss the histologic and radiographic characteristics of the chondroid chordoma and compare it with other tumors that arise in the nasoseptal area to highlight the different prognoses and approaches to management.</str>

      <str>The T-box genes constitute an evolutionarily conserved family of putative transcription factors which are expressed in discrete domains during embryogenesis, suggesting that they may play roles in inductive interactions. Members have been identified by virtue of their homology to the prototypical T-box gene, T or Brachyury, which is required for mesoderm formation and axial elongation during embryogenesis. We have previously reported the discovery of six new mouse T-box genes, Tbx1-Tbx6, and described the expression patterns of Tbx1-Tbx5 (Bollag et al., 1994; Agulnik et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 1996; Gibson-Brown et al., 1996). We have obtained cDNA clones encoding the full-length Tbx6 protein from screens of gastrulation-stage mouse cDNA libraries and determined the spatial and temporal distribution of Tbx6 transcripts during embryogenesis. The gene codes for a 1.9-kb transcript with an open reading frame coding for a 540-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular weight of 59 kDa. Tbx6 maps to chromosome 7 and does not appear to be linked to any known mutation. Unlike other members of the mouse T-box gene family which are expressed in a wide variety of tissues derived from all germ layers, Tbx6 expression is quite restricted. Tbx6 transcripts are first detected in the gastrulation stage embryo in the primitive streak and newly recruited paraxial mesoderm. Later in development, Tbx6 expression is restricted to presomitic, paraxial mesoderm and to the tail bud, which replaces the streak as the source of mesoderm. Expression in the tail bud persists until 12. 5 days postcoitus. Tbx6 expression thus overlaps that of Brachyury in the primitive streak and tail bud, although Brachyury is expressed earlier in the primitive streak. Brachyury is also expressed in a second domain, the node and notochord, that is not shared with Tbx6. The onset of Tbx6 expression is not affected in homozygous null Brachyury mutant embryos at 7.5 days postcoitus. However, Tbx6 expression is extinguished in mutant embryos as soon as the Brachyury phenotype becomes evident at 8.5 days postcoitus, indicating that the continued expression of Tbx6 is directly or indirectly dependent upon Brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>Homologues of the T-box gene Brachyury play important roles in mesoderm differentiation and other aspects of early development in all bilaterians. In the diploblast Hydra, the Brachyury homologue HyBra1 acts early in the formation of the hypostome, the location of the organiser in adult Hydra. We now report the isolation and characterisation of a second Brachyury gene, HyBra2. Sequence analysis suggests that HyBra1 and HyBra2 are paralogues, resulting from an ancient lineage-specific gene duplication. We show that both paralogues acquired novel functions, both at the level of their cis-regulation as well as through significant divergence of the coding sequence. Both genes are expressed in the hypostome, but HyBra1 is predominantly endodermal, whereas HyBra2 transcripts are found primarily in the ectoderm. During bud formation, both genes are activated before any sign of evagination, suggesting an early role in head formation. During regeneration, HyBra1 is an immediate-early response gene and is insensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, whereas the onset of expression of HyBra2 is delayed and requires protein synthesis. The functional consequence of HyBra1/2 protein divergence on cell fate decisions was tested in Xenopus. HyBra1 induces mesoderm, like vertebrate Brachyury proteins. By contrast, HyBra2 shows a strong cement-gland and neural-inducing activity. Domain-swapping experiments show that the C-terminal domain of HyBra2 is responsible for this specific phenotype. Our data support the concept of sub- and neofunctionalisation upon gene duplication and show that divergence of cis-regulation and coding sequence in paralogues can lead to dramatic changes in structure and function.</str>

      <str>We have sought to determine the production and activity of serine proteases in primary and metastatic spinal tumors and the association of these enzymes with the invasive and metastatic properties of spinal column tumors. Using immunohistochemical techniques, the cellular localization and expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was assessed, whereas its activity was determined by fibrin zymography, and the amounts of enzyme were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in primary spinal column tumors (chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and giant cell tumor) and metastatic tumors of the spine arising from various malignancies (breast, lung, thyroid, and renal cell carcinomas, and melanomas). Metastatic tumors displayed higher levels of uPA activity than did primary spinal tumors (P&lt;0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that uPA expression was highest in metastases from lung and breast carcinomas and melanomas, followed by metastatic tumors from thyroid and renal cell carcinomas. Similar results were obtained for uPA activity and enzyme level as determined by fibrin zymography and ELISA, respectively. We conclude that metastatic spinal tumors possess higher levels of uPA expression and activity than the primary spinal tumors, which tend to be less aggressive and only locally invasive malignancies. The results suggest that the plasminogen system may participate in the metastasis of tumors to the spinal column.</str>

      <str>The authors describe a precise surgical technique in which a large intraspinal and extraspinal, multivertebral, cervical chordoma was completely removed in one stage using the lateral approach. The patient in this case was a 29-year-old woman who presented with signs of radicular pain in the left C-3 area. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large intra- and extraspinal multivertebral tumor from C-2 to C-5, a finding that suggested a cervical chordoma. The tumor was completely removed in one stage using the lateral approach while controlling the vertebral artery (VA), and a partial corporectomy of C2-5 was also performed. Results from a postoperative histopathological examination confirmed that the tumor was a typical chordoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Cervical chordomas are typically excised using a posterior-anterior surgical approach with partial resection of the tumor. The lateral approach was appropriate in this patient for complete resection in one stage, because it enabled the surgeons to control the VA and access both extraspinal and intraspinal components of the chordoma.</str>

      <str>We report a case of a clival chordoma in a 21-year-old man that ultrastructurally demonstrated large numbers of microtubule aggregates within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Histologically, the tumor demonstrated classic chordoma architecture characterized by numerous physaliphorous cells and an abundant extracellular matrix. The tumor cells stained strongly for cytokeratin, S100 protein, and epithelial membrane antigen, indicative of the epithelial origin of this tumor. Ultrastructurally, the most conspicuous feature of this tumor consisted of parallel bundles of criss-crossing microtubules within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These microtubules had a diameter of approximately 27 nm and did not demonstrate an internal structure. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microtubule aggregates in a spheno-occipital chordoma. We note that microtubule aggregates have been described in a number of different entities, and though proposed as a specific feature of "chondroid chordoma," they are a nonspecific finding.</str>

Median time to progression was 9.9, 8.0, and 8.3 weeks for chordoma, STS, and GIST patients, respectively. Three- and 6-month progression-free survival rates were 47% and 33% for chordoma patients, 26% and 22% for STS patients, and 31% and 23% for GIST patients, respectively. Ten patients (10%) stopped study drug before disease progression secondary to toxicity. Common adverse events included anemia (42 patients, seven with grade 3/4 toxicity), leukopenia (33 patients, nine with grade 3/4 toxicity), fatigue (30 patients, three with grade 3/4 toxicity), nausea (34 patients, six with grade 3/4 toxicity), and diarrhea (28 patients, five with grade 3/4 toxicity).</str>

      <str>Using the Hawaiian acorn worm, Ptychodera flava, we began molecular studies on the development of hemichordates, a phylum previously unstudied at this level. Here we review results garnered from the examination of a few specific genes selected to help understand the evolution of vertebrate structures. These studies suggest new ideas about the evolution of developmental mechanisms in the deuterostomes. In a seminal observation, we noted an unexpected zone of expression of the Brachyurygene in the early anterior embryonic ectoderm where the mouth will form. Typically, the Brachyury gene is closely linked to development of the notochord and is expressed around the blastopore and in the posterior mesoderm in most animals. This first expression of Brachyury at the blastopore may represent a regulatory program associated with organizing the original animal head and gut opening, as suggested by the expression of Brachyury during hypostome formation in hydra. We believe that the anterior expression of Brachyury in deuterostomes represents the cooption of the program for organizing the original animal gut opening to form the deuterostome mouth. Recent data from the trochophore larva of a polychaete show that an anterior zone of expression of Brachyury is produced in this protostome by splitting of the Brachyury field during the formation of a gut with a mouth and anus by the lateral fusion of the sides of the blastopore. The ability to initiate independently a secondary regulatory program to organize the new mouth leading to an anterior field of Brachyury expression may be a signal event in the evolution of the deuterostomes. We also noted that the P. flava homolog of T-brain/Eomes, a gene closely related by sequence and expression around the blastopore to Brachyury and associated with development of the vertebrate brain, also exhibits early posterior expression around the blastopore and a field of de novo anterior ectoderm expression during later embryogenesis. The tissue in the zone of de novo anterior ectoderm expression of Pf-Tbrain produces the apical organ, a larval neural structure that has been touted as an evolutionary precursor of the chordate dorsal brain. The gene regulatory mechanisms responsible for initiating the anterior zone of de novo expression of T-brain may represent a cooption to specify early neuroectoderm of the regulatory program evolved first to drive anterior Brachyury expression for deuterostome mouth formation. It will be interesting to examine the possibilities that an ability to initiate the de novo anterior expression of the program that includes T-brain may be a key event in the evolution of the developmental mechanisms leading to the chordate dorsal nervous system.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a relatively rare tumor of the skull base and sacrum thought to originate from embryonic remnants of the notochord. Chordomas arising from the skull base/clivus are typically locally aggressive with lytic bone destruction. When chordomas occur in an extraosseous location, they may mimic other lesions of the nasopharynx. We present 5 cases of primarily extraosseous chordoma involving the nasopharynx in an effort to improve the preoperative diagnosis of this rare tumor. In addition, we review regional notochordal embryology to explain this variant tumor location.</str>
      <str>We reviewed the clinical and imaging data of 5 pathologically proved cases of extraosseous chordoma of the nasopharynx seen or reviewed at our institution during the last decade. All cases had both CT and MR imaging. The study had institutional review board approval.</str>
      <str>The primary clinical complaint in the 5 patients with extraosseous nasopharyngeal chordoma was nasal obstruction. The extraosseous chordomas were centered in the nasopharynx. Bony lytic changes along the anterior surface of the clivus were seen on 5 of 5 CT studies. A midline sinus tract was seen in 3 of 5 patients. MR imaging showed heterogeneous hyperintense T2 signal intensity (5/5).</str>

Complete removal of the soft-tissue tumor and the clival sinus tract is the treatment of choice in such cases.</str>

      <str>Cytogenetic information on chordomas is rudimentary and restricted to GTG-banding analysis of 26 cases worldwide. In this study, we present the chromosomal imbalances detected in a series of 16 chordomas (10 sacrococcyeal, five sphenooccipital, and one spinal) from 13 patients using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). On average, 3.2 losses and 4.2 gains were detected per tumor. The most common DNA copy number alterations were losses on chromosomal arms 3p (50%) and 1p (44%). Losses of 3p were detected in five of seven primary chordomas. Therefore, the loss of 3p might be an early event in chordoma genesis. The most common gains involved 7q (69%), 20 (50%), 5q (38%), and 12q (38%). Additionally, we raised the first human chordoma cell line, U-CH1, from a recurrence of a sacral chordoma. U-CH1 and its parent tumor had almost the same CGH profile. According to GTG-banding and multicolor FISH, U-CH1 has the following clonal chromosomal abnormalities: der(1)t(1;22), del(4), +del(5), +del(6), +7, del(9), del(10), +der(20)t(10;20), +21. Thus, the novel permanent human chordoma cell line U-CH1 has chordoma-typical cytogenetic aberrations. Our data suggest that tumor suppressor genes or mismatch repair genes (located at 1p31 and 3p14) and oncogenes (located in 7q36) might be involved in chordoma genesis.</str>

Few examples of this tumor are classified under the term parachordoma, while probably many more are designated as chordoid sarcomas. The tumor presents histological features similar to those of chordoma, as well as to extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (chordoid sarcomas), and should also be differentiated from chondroid syringoma or mixed tumor of the skin. The tumor reported herein appeared as a deep cited soft tissue mass, presenting the histology of chordoma in an extra-axial localization. On the other hand, the positive immunoreactions of the tumor cells with cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) ruled out the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma.

      <str>Chordomas are rare bone tumors arising from remnants of the notochord. Molecular studies to determine the pathways involved in their pathogenesis and develop better treatments are limited. Alterations in microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer. miRNAs are small RNA sequences that affect transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in most eukaryotic organisms. Studies show that miRNA dysregulation is important for tumor initiation and progression. We compared the expression profile of miRNAs in chordomas to that of healthy nucleus pulposus samples to gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of chordomas. Results of functional studies on one of the altered miRNAs, miR-31, are presented. The comparison between the miRNA profile of chordoma samples and the profile of normal nucleus pulposus samples suggests dysregulation of 53 miRNAs. Thirty miRNAs were upregulated in our tumor samples, while 23 were downregulated. Notably, hsa-miR-140-3p and hsa-miR-148a were upregulated in most chordomas relative to levels in nucleus pulposus cells. Two other miRNAs, hsa-miR-31 and hsa-miR-222, were downregulated in chordomas compared with the control group. Quantification with real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed up or downregulation of these miRNAs among all samples. Functional analyses showed that hsa-miR-31 has an apoptotic effect on chordoma cells and downregulates the expression of c-MET and radixin. miRNA profiling showed that hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-140-3p and hsa-miR-148a are differentially expressed in chordomas compared with healthy nucleus pulposus. Our profiling may be the first step toward delineating the differential regulation of cancer-related genes in chordomas, helping to reveal the mechanisms of initiation and progression. </str>

      <str>Two autopsy cases of sacrococcygeal chordoma which showed sarcomatous components in the primary and metastatic tumors are reported. Case 1 was a 48-year-old female who died 9 years after the development of the initial symptoms. Autopsy findings showed metastatic tumors consisted of malignant tumor cells similar to fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Case 2 was a 63-year-old male who died 11 years after the development of the initial symptom. At autopsy only sarcomatous tumors resembling malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) were observed in the metastatic lesions. Both cases were treated with irradiation. It is suggested that the appearance of sarcomatous tumor in current two cases of chordoma might be due to the phenomenon of tumor progression closely associated with irradiation therapy. These two cases can be categorized as "chordoma with a malignant spindle cell component" in a sense that highly malignant sarcomatous components existed in conjunction with chordoma in the primary tumors.</str>

      <str>Several T-box genes are considered to play important roles in developing limbs, tails and neural retinae. Five novel T-box genes in the Japanese newt were isolated and their expression was analyzed, together with another T-box gene of brachyury, during embryogenesis and in the developing and regenerating limbs and tail. Four are designated CpTbx2, CpTbx3, CpTbx6R and CpEomesodermin based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, and the other is named CpUbiqT from its ubiquitous expression. While all were expressed during embryogenesis, only four of them (CpTbx2, CpTbx3, CpUbiqT and brachyury) were detected in developing limbs and/or tails. Except for brachyury, they were continuously expressed in normal adult appendages and showed elevated expression levels in regenerating limbs, whereas only CpTbx2 showed significant up-regulation in regenerating tails. Compared with orthologous genes in other species, CpTbx2, CpTbx3 and CpEomesodermin showed several notable differences such as an abundance of maternal transcripts of CpEomesodermin, a unique insertion sequence within the T-box domain of CpTbx2, and a lack of visible expression of CpTbx2and CpTbx3 in the apical ectodermal region of developing limbs. In view of the uniqueness of the newt, these results are discussed with respect to the possibility of their involvement in regeneration.</str>

      <str>A chordoma was removed from the tail base of a 6.5-year-old ferret (Mustela putorius furo). A nodule was observed in the area of tumor development when the ferret was purchased at 3 months of age. Although the nodule did not enlarge for 2 years, slow, steady growth of the tumor was observed for 4 years before surgical removal. Eight months after removal of the chordoma, the ferret developed 2 cutaneous masses. One was adjacent to the vulva, close to where the chordoma had been removed from, whereas the other was in the nasofacial region. After 4 months of slow growth, both masses were removed and both were histologically and immunohistochemically consistent with chordoma. Over the next 8 weeks, additional masses developed in the facial, maxillary gingival, and scapular regions. Enlargement of the gingival mass caused dysphagia, and the ferret was euthanized. Although a necropsy was not performed, these additional masses had a clinical appearance and texture that was similar to the 2 previously removed cutaneous chordomas. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a ferret coccygeal chordoma that developed close to the base of the tail. Ferret chordomas have been reported previously to metastasize to the subcutis overlying the tumor. However, this is the first report of a ferret chordoma that metastasized to a location distant to the primary site of neoplasm development. Cell proliferation indices did not predict this metastatic behavior. It is hypothesized that the long clinical period before removal may have predisposed this neoplasm to metastasis. Observations from this case suggest that chordomas in ferrets may have metastatic potential and so should be removed promptly.</str>

      <str>The molecular mechanisms underlying chordoma pathogenesis are unknown. We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets. Given the relatively high costs of whole genome sequencing, we performed a focused genetic analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (Sequenom iPLEX genotyping). We tested 865 hotspot mutations in 111 oncogenes and selected tumor suppressor genes (OncoMap v. 3.0) of 45 human chordoma tumor samples. Of the analyzed samples, seven were identified with at least one mutation. Six of these were from fresh frozen samples, and one was from a paraffin embedded sample. These observations were validated using an independent platform using homogeneous mass extend MALDI-TOF (Sequenom hME Genotyping). These genetic alterations include: ALK (A877S), CTNNB1 (T41A), NRAS (Q61R), PIK3CA (E545K), PTEN (R130), CDKN2A (R58*), and SMARCB1 (R40*). This study reports on the largest comprehensive mutational analysis of chordomas performed to date. To focus on mutations that have the greatest chance of clinical relevance, we tested only oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that have been previously implicated in the tumorigenesis of more common malignancies. We identified rare genetic changes that may have functional significance to the underlying biology and potential therapeutics for chordomas. Mutations in CDKN2A and PTEN occurred in areas of chromosomal copy loss. When this data is paired with the studies showing 18 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at the locus for CDKN2A, 17 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at PTEN, and 3 of 4 chordoma samples displaying deletion at the SMARCB1 locus, we can infer that a loss of heterozygosity at these three loci may play a significant role in chordoma pathogenesis. </str>

      <str>The notochord is the distinctive characteristic of chordates; however, the knowledge of the complement of transcription factors governing the development of this structure is still incomplete. Here we present the expression patterns of seven transcription factor genes detected in the notochord of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis at various stages of embryonic development. Four of these transcription factors, Fos-a, NFAT5, AFF and Klf15, have not been directly associated with the notochord in previous studies, while the others, including Spalt-like-a, Lmx-like, and STAT5/6-b, display evolutionarily conserved expression in this structure as well as in other domains. We examined the hierarchical relationships between these genes and the transcription factor Brachyury, which is necessary for notochord development in all chordates. We found that Ciona Brachyury regulates the expression of most, although not all, of these genes. These results shed light on the genetic regulatory program underlying notochord formation in Ciona and possibly other chordates.</str>

      <str>Xenopus provides a well-studied model of vertebrate gastrulation, but a central feature, the movement of the mesoderm to the interior of the embryo, has received little attention. Here, we analyze mesoderm involution at the Xenopus dorsal blastopore lip. We show that a phase of rapid involution - peak involution - is intimately linked to an early stage of convergent extension, which involves differential cell migration in the prechordal mesoderm and a new movement of the chordamesoderm, radial convergence. The latter process depends on Xenopus Brachyury, the expression of which at the time of peak involution is controlled by signaling through the ephrin receptor, EphA4, its ligand ephrinB2 and its downstream effector p21-activated kinase. Our findings support a conserved role for Brachyury in blastopore morphogenesis.</str>

      <str>The vertebrate Brachyury (T) gene is transiently expressed in nascent and migrating mesoderm, in the differentiating notochord, and in the tail bud, reflecting its independent functions. In contrast, the expression of an ascidian Brachyury gene (As-T) is restricted to differentiating notochord. The present study revealed that the genome of Halocynthia roretzi contains another T-domain gene (As-T2) which encodes a divergent T-domain protein. The transient expression of As-T2 was detected in the endoderm- and muscle-lineage blastomeres of the early embryo and the transcript was retained by involuting and differentiating muscle cells until it became undetectable by the mid-tailbud stage. In addition, As-T2 was expressed transiently in cells that form the tip of the newly forming tail. Interestingly, the combined pattern of spatial expression of As-T and As-T2 appears to correspond to that of a single vertebrate Brachyury gene.</str>

The young cells contain almost no glycogen ; progressively it becomes more abundant and fills up almost the whole cytoplasm. At the end of the evolution glycogen disappears while the cell becomes vacuolated. This suggests that enzymatic lysis of this polysaccharide could be the cause of the vacuolation which finally produces the physaliferous cell. Comparison between the cells of the chordoma and those of the normal notochord shows some morphological similarities in the development of these cells.

These tumours are locally invasive but have also a metastastic potential.Chordomas are characterized by the presence of physaliferous cells in a myxofibrillary stromal background. In cytological aspirates, these characteristic cells are usually absent, revealing only clusters of cells with varying degrees of vacuolation. This makes definitive diagnosis of chordoma difficult as the tumor can mimic other myxoid neoplasms including renal cell carcinomas and well-differentiated chondrosarcomas.

      <str>Hemangioblastomas are central nervous system (CNS) tumors of unknown histogenesis, which can occur sporadically or in von Hippel-Lindau disease. Hemangioblastomas are composed of neoplastic "stromal" cells of unknown origin, accompanied by intensive reactive angiogenesis. Failure to specify the cytologic origin of the stromal cell has precluded the development of nonsurgical therapies and limits understanding of its basic biology. We report that the stromal cells express proteins (Scl, brachyury, Csf-1R, Gata-1, Flk-1, and Tie-2) that characterize embryonic progenitor cells with hemangioblastic differentiation potential and conclude that embryonic progenitors with hemangioblast potential represent a possible cytologic equivalent of the stromal cell. We also identified a new autocrine/paracrine stimulatory loop between the receptor Tie-2 and the hypoxia-inducible factor target Ang-1, which, combined with previous observations, suggests that a variety of autocrine loops may be initiated in hemangioblastomas, depending on the differentiation status of the tumor cells and the extent of HIF downstream activation. Finally, the consistent identification of Scl in the stromal cells may help explain the unique and characteristic topographical distribution of hemangioblastomas within the CNS.</str>

      <str>In ascidian embryos, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in blastomeres of the notochord lineage and play an essential role in the notochord cell differentiation. The genetic cascade leading to the transcriptional activation of Brachyury in A-line notochord cells of Ciona embryos begins with maternally provided beta-catenin, which is essential for endodermal cell specification. beta-catenin directly activates zygotic expression of a forkhead transcription factor gene, FoxD, at the 16-cell stage, which in turn somehow activates a zinc finger transcription factor gene, ZicL, at the 32-cell stage, and then Brachyury at the 64-cell stage. One of the key questions to be answered is whether ZicL functions as a direct activator of Brachyury transcription, and this was addressed in the present study. A fusion protein was constructed in which a zinc finger domain of Ciona ZicL was connected to the C-terminus of GST. Extensive series of PCR-assisted binding site selection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the most plausible recognition sequence of Ciona ZicL was CCCGCTGTG. We found the elements CACAGCTGG (complementary sequence: CCAGCTGTG) at -123 and CCAGCTGTG at -168 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site of Ci-Bra in a previously identified basal enhancer of this gene. In vitro binding assays indicated that the ZicL fusion protein binds to these elements efficiently. A fusion gene construct in which lacZ was fused with the upstream sequence of Ci-Bra showed the reporter gene expression exclusively in notochord cells when the construct was introduced into fertilized eggs. In contrast, fusion constructs with mutated ZicL-binding-elements failed to show the reporter expression. In addition, suppression of Ci-ZicL abolished the reporter gene expression, while ectopic and/or overexpression of Ci-ZicL resulted in ectopic reporter expression in non-notochord cells. These results provide evidence that ZicL directly activates Brachyury, leading to specification and subsequent differentiation of notochord cells.</str>

      <str>We explored the general feasibility of proton beam therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base. Clinical records and treatment-planning data of patients with the pathological diagnosis of chordoma or chondrosarcoma were examined. Proton beam therapy was administered for gross tumor mass as well as microscopic residual disease after surgery. The prescribed dose was determined to maximize the coverage of the target and to not exceed predefined constraints for the organs at risk. Eight cases of chordoma and eight cases of chondrosarcoma were enrolled. The median tumor volume was 40 cm(3) (range, 7 to 546 cm(3)). The prescribed dose ranged from 50 to 70 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]), with a median of 63 Gy RBE. The median follow-up duration was 42 months (range 9 to 80 months). The overall survival rate was 100%, and the local control rate at 3 years of chordoma and chondrosarcoma were 100% and 86%. None of the patients developed radiation-induced optic neuropathy, brain stem injury, or other severe toxicity. Proton beam therapy is generally feasible for both chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base, with excellent local control and survival rates.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumours arising from notochordal remnants. Classical chordomas are generally extradural and, despite benign histopathology, they typically destroy the clivus and surrounding bone structures. Intradural lesions are extremely rare and less than thirty cases of intracranial, exclusively intradural chordomas have been reported so far. The intracranial, intradural but extranotochordal location of chordoma is extremely unique. The authors present a case of chordoma in intracranial location that clinically mimics lateral sphenoid wing meningioma. A previously healthy 39-year-old man was admitted to our Department because of optic disc oedema without neurological deficits. Neuroimaging studies showed a large, contrast-enhanced tumour in the right frontotemporal region that was thought to be a pterional meningioma. The patient underwent successful removal of the tumour. Histopathological study revealed a typical pattern of chordoma, confirmed by immunohistochemical findings. Because of the tumour location the differentiation between chordoma and chordoid meningioma ought to be considered. Such cases, including the present one, may lead to the conclusion that embryonic notochordal remnants may be lost in different places, even away from the neuroaxis.</str>

      <str>Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base are rare tumors with overlapping presentations and anatomic imaging features but different prognoses. We hypothesized that these tumors might be distinguished by using diffusion-weighted MR imaging.</str>
      <str>We retrospectively reviewed 19 patients with pathologically confirmed chordoma or chondrosarcoma who underwent both conventional and diffusion-weighted MR imaging.

      <str>Chondrosarcoma was associated with the highest mean ADC value (2051 ± 261 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and was significantly different from classic chordoma (1474 ± 117 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and poorly differentiated chordoma (875 ± 100 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) (P &lt; .001). Poorly differentiated chordoma was characterized by low T2 signal intensity (P = .001), but other conventional MR imaging features of enhancement and/or lesion location did not reliably distinguish these tumor types.</str>

      <str>How does a fertilized egg decode its own genome to eventually develop into a mature animal? Each developing cell must activate a battery of genes in a timely manner and according to the function it will ultimately perform, but how? During development of the notochord--a structure akin to the vertebrate spine--in a simple marine invertebrate, an essential protein called Brachyury binds to specific sites in its target genes. A study just published in PLOS Biology reports that if the target gene contains multiple Brachyury-binding sites it will be activated early in development but if it contains only one site it will be activated later. Genes that contain no binding site can still be activated by Brachyury, but only indirectly by an earlier Brachyury-dependent gene product, so later than the directly activated genes. Thus, this study shows how several genes can interpret the presence of a single factor differently to become active at distinct times in development.</str>

      <str>The brachyury, or T, locus encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the early development of all animals. In the mouse, animals heterozygous for a null mutation at this locus are born with a characteristic short tail. Expressivity of the short tail phenotype is greatly affected by genetic background. As a genetic entry into the identification of genes that interact with the Brachyury locus, we have performed a QTL analysis for modifiers of this phenotype. Surprisingly, we discovered that the major modifiers uncovered all act in a sex-limited manner. We have identified two QTLs--Brm1 on Chr 9 and Brm2 on Chr 15--that act only in female offspring(N2) from female T/+ parents(F1) and are responsible together for most, or all, of the genetic variance in phenotypic expression observed between C57BL/10 and C3H/HeJ animals.</str>

      <str>The notochord is one of the characteristic features of the phylum Chordata. The vertebrate Brachyury gene is known to be essential for the terminal differentiation of chordamesoderm into notochord. In the ascidian, which belongs to the subphylum Urochordata, differentiation of notochord cells is induced at the late phase of the 32-cell stage through cellular interaction with adjacent endoderm cells as well as neighboring notochord cells. The ascidian Brachyury gene (As-T) is expressed exclusively in the notochord-lineage blastomeres, and the timing of gene expression at the 64-cell stage precisely coincides with that of the developmental fate restriction of the blastomeres. In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the inductive events and As-T expression. In the present study, we show that overexpression of As-T by microinjection of the synthesized As-T RNA results in the occurrence, without the induction, of notochord-specific features in the A-line presumptive notochord blastomeres. We also show that overexpression of As-T RNA leads to ectopic expression of notochord-specific features in non-notochord lineages, including those of spinal cord and endoderm. These results strongly suggest that the developmental role of the Brachyury is conserved throughout chordates in notochord formation.</str>

      <str>The formation of the primitive streak is the first visible sign of gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers are formed from a single epithelium during early development. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide a good system for understanding the molecular and cellular events associated with these processes. Previous work, both in embryos and in culture, has shown how converging signals from both nodal/TGFβR and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways specify cells to adopt a primitive-streak-like fate and direct them to undertake an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, many of these approaches have relied on genetic analyses without taking into account the temporal progression of events within single cells. In addition, it is still unclear to what extent events in the embryo are able to be reproduced in culture.</str>
      <str>Here, we combine flow cytometry and a quantitative live single-cell imaging approach to demonstrate how the controlled differentiation of mouse ESCs towards a primitive streak fate in culture results in cells displaying many of the characteristics observed during early mouse development including transient brachyury expression, EMT and increased motility. We also find that the EMT initiates the process, and this is both fuelled and terminated by the action of brachyury, whose expression is dependent on the EMT and β-catenin activity.</str>

      <str>Intervertebral disc (IVD) consists of a soft gelatinous material in its center, the nucleus pulposus (NP), bounded peripherally by fibrocartilage, annulus fibrosus (AF). Despite the number of patients with IVD degeneration, gene expression analysis has not been undertaken in NP and therefore little is known about the molecular markers expressed in NP. Here, we undertook a microarray screen in NP with the other nine tissues to identify the specific cell surface markers for NP. Five membrane associating molecules out of 10,490 genes were identified as highly expressing genes in NP compared with the other tissues. Among them, we identified CD24, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor protein as a cell surface marker for NP. CD24 expression was also detected in the herniated NP and chordoma, a malignant primary tumor derived from notochordal cells, while it was absent in chondrosarcoma. Therefore, CD24 is a molecular marker for NP as well as the diseases of IVD.</str>

Inadequate surgical margin without radiotherapy, involvement of contiguous vertebral levels, and cervical spine location were adverse factors for overall survival.

      <str>We have studied the expression of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family of receptors during the DMSO-induced differentiation of P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells into mesoderm and muscle. RXR-alpha protein is weakly detectable in untreated P19 cells and in a mutant line of P19 cells (D3) that are resistant to DMSO-induced differentiation but begins to increase by day 3 and continues to rise gradually thereafter, whereas RXR-gamma protein is readily detected in P19 cells and decreases over the course of differentiation. Protein expression is uncoupled from mRNA levels, because DMSO induces a rapid, aggregation-independent, transient increase in RXR-alpha mRNA that diminishes by day 3 of differentiation. Thus, the expression of RXR-alpha protein is prevented at early times during DMSO-induced differentiation. Stable P19 cell clones that constitutively express RXR-alpha protein [P19(RXR-alpha)] are resistant to DMSO-induced differentiation associated with increased levels of oligonucleosomal-length DNA fragmentation. Loss of RXR-alpha expression after multiple passages results in a reversion to a DMSO-responsive phenotype. Id1 transcripts are present in P19 cells and are transiently decreased on day 2 of DMSO differentiation but remain elevated in DMSO-treated P19(RXR-alpha) and in P19 cells treated simultaneously with retinoic acid and DMSO. The mRNA for the mesoderm inducer protein Brachyury T was also deregulated in P19(RXR-alpha) cells and D3 cells compared with that of wild-type P19 cells. Together, these results show that expression of the RXR-alpha mRNA and protein in P19 cells is tightly regulated during the mesodermal/muscle differentiation of P19 cells, and that ectopic expression of the RXR-alpha protein prevents differentiation associated with increased cell death, prolonged expression of Brachyury T, and constitutive expression of Id1.</str>

      <str>Homologues of the murine Brachyury gene have been shown to be involved in mesoderm formation in several vertebrate species. In frogs, the Xenopus Brachyury homologue, Xbra, is required for normal formation of posterior mesoderm. We report the characterisation of a second Brachyury homologue from Xenopus, Xbra3, which has levels of identity with mouse Brachyury similar to those of Xbra. Xbra3 encodes a nuclear protein expressed in mesoderm in a temporal and spatial manner distinct from that observed for Xbra. Xbra3 expression is induced by mesoderm-inducing factors and overexpression of Xbra3 can induce mesoderm formation in animal caps. In contrast to Xbra, Xbra3 is also able to cause the formation of neural tissue in animal caps. Xbra3 overexpression induces both geminin and Xngnr-1, suggesting that Xbra3 can play a role in the earliest stages of neural induction. Xbra3 induces posterior nervous tissue by an FGF-dependent pathway; a complete switch to anterior neural tissue can be effected by the inhibition of FGF signalling. Neither noggin, chordin, follistatin, nor Xnr3 is induced by Xbra3 to an extent different from their induction by Xbra nor is BMP4 expression differentially affected.</str>

      <str>T-box transcription factors are a large family of transcriptional regulators involved in many aspects of embryonic development. In a previous report, we described the isolation and genomic characterization of two T-box genes from the siliceous sponge Suberites domuncula: a Brachyury homologue, Sd-Bra, and a Tbx2 homologue, Sd-Tbx2. Elucidation of the genomic structure of Sd-Bra allowed us to demonstrate the existence of two different isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing. Moreover, we demonstrated that the shorter isoform exists in two different glycosylation states.</str>
      <str>In the present study, we demonstrate a differential subcellular localization of the three Sd-Bra isoforms, suggesting that its differential nuclear import could be an important mechanism for its functional regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Sd-Tbx2 exists only in one isoform, which is mainly localized in the nucleus. The pattern of expression of Sd-Bra and Sd-Tbx2 genes is analysed in sponge tissue, in gemmules and in cultured cells.</str>
      <str>These results suggest a conserved role for Sd-Bra in the control of morphogenetic movements through the regulation of cell-adhesion properties and the involvement of Sd-Tbx2 in the determination of cell identity in the early stages of differentiation, reminiscent of the function of Tbx2-3-4-5 in vertebrates during limb specification. Also, the fact that a Brachyury and a Tbx2 homologue exist in S. domuncula suggests that the first divergence from the ancestral Brachyury-like gene might be a Tbx2-like gene and not a Tbrain-like gene as had been previously suggested.</str>

      <str>The BMP2-dependent onset of osteo/chondrogenic differentiation in the acknowledged pluripotent murine mesenchymal stem cell line (C3H10T1/2) is accompanied by the immediate upregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) and a delayed response by FGFR2. Forced expression of FGFR3 in C3H10T1/2 is sufficient for chondrogenic differentiation, indicating an important role for FGF-signaling during the manifestation of the chondrogenic lineage in this cell line. Screening for transcription factors exhibiting a chondrogenic capacity in C3H10T1/2 identified that the T-box containing transcription factor Brachyury is upregulated by FGFR3-mediated signaling. Forced expression of Brachyury in C3H10T1/2 was sufficient for differentiation into the chondrogenic lineage in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into muscle. A dominant-negative variant of Brachyury, consisting of its DNA-binding domain (T-box), interferes with BMP2-mediated cartilage formation. These studies indicate that BMP-initiated FGF-signaling induces a novel type of transcription factor for the onset of chondrogenesis in a mesenchymal stem cell line. A potential role for this T-box factor in skeletogenesis is further delineated from its expression profile in various skeletal elements such as intervertebral disks and the limb bud at late stages (18.5 d.p.c.) of murine embryonic development.</str>

A 63-year-old female presented with weakness in the left upper extremity. The patient visited a local doctor and underwent brain computerized tomography (CT). CT revealed a brain tumor, and she was referred to our hospital. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a midline intradural retroclival tumor in addition to an intradural extramedullary mass lesion at the level of C1-C2. The patient developed a spastic gait disturbance that forced her to use a cane. She underwent laminectomy at C1-C2 along with total removal of the tumor and showed no remarkable symptoms after surgery. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma. One month after the cervical surgery, the intracranial tumor was subtotally removed in intracranial surgery via the right subtemporal approach. Histopathological data were identical to that of the cervical tumor. The patient consulted another hospital and underwent gamma-knife surgery. Her neurological examination is relatively unchanged 20 months after the cervical surgery. This case suggests that neuroradiological evaluation should also be performed for an intradural spinal chordoma when an intracranial chordoma is detected. Careful determination of the tumor responsible for the symptoms is necessary if an intradural spinal chordoma is simultaneously detected with an intracranial chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare mesenchymal tumors occurring exclusively in the midline from clivus to sacrum. Early tumor detection is extremely important as these tumors are resistant to chemotherapy and irradiation. Despite continuous research efforts surgical excision remains the main treatment option. Because of the often challenging anatomic location early detection is important to enable complete tumor resection and to reduce the high incidence of local recurrences. The aim of this study was to explore whether DNA methylation, a well known epigenetic marker, may play a role in chordoma development and if hypermethylation of specific CpG islands may serve as potential biomarkers correlated with SNP analyses in chordoma. The study was performed on tumor samples from ten chordoma patients. We found significant genomic instability by Affymetrix 6.0. It was interesting to see that all chordomas showed a loss of 3q26.32 (PIK 3CA) and 3q27.3 (BCL6) thus underlining the potential importance of the PI3K pathway in chordoma development. By using the AITCpG360 methylation assay we elucidated 20 genes which were hyper/hypomethylated compared to normal blood. The most promising candidates were nine hyper/hypomethylated genes C3, XIST, TACSTD2, FMR1, HIC1, RARB, DLEC1, KL, and RASSF1. In summary, we have shown that chordomas are characterized by a significant genomic instability and furthermore we demonstrated a characteristic DNA methylation pattern. These findings add new insights into chordoma development, diagnosis and potential new treatment options.</str>

Individual case series with decades of data collection provide some insight into the pathobiology of this tumor and its responses to treatment. This meta-analysis is an attempt to aggregate the sum experiences and present a comprehensive review of their findings. We performed a comprehensive review of studies published in English language literature and found a total of over 2,000 patients treated for cranial chordoma. Patient information was then extracted from each paper and aggregated into a comprehensive database. The tumor recurrences in these patients were then stratified according to age (&lt;21 vs. &gt;21 years), histological findings (chondroid vs. typical) and treatment (surgery and radiation vs. surgery only). Data was analyzed via Pearson chi-square and t-test. A total of 464 non-duplicated patients from 121 articles treated for cranial chordoma met the inclusion criteria. The recurrence rate among all patients was 68% (314 patients) with an average disease-free interval of 45 months (median, 23 months). The mean follow-up time was 39 months (median, 27 months). The patients in younger group, patients with chordoma with chondroid histologic type, and patients who received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy had significantly lower recurrence rate than their respective counterparts. The results of our systematic analysis provide useful data for practitioners in objectively summarizing the tumor recurrence in patients with cranial chordomas.

      <str>Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation is an excellent model to study chromatin changes at developmentally regulated loci. Differentiating mouse and human ESCs increase genome-wide acetylation (euchromatic) and tri-methylation (heterochromatic) of lysine 9 on histone H3. The Oct4 locus is euchromatic when expressed in undifferentiated ESCs and heterochromatic after differentiation. Brachyury T, a mesoderm-specific transcription factor, is not yet expressed in undifferentiated cells, where its locus has "bivalent" tri-methyl lysine 4 and lysine 27 modifications. During directed differentiation to pre-cardiac mesoderm, the activated brachyury locus has high levels of tri-methyl lysine 4 (euchromatin), switching to heterochromatin after gene silencing. Thus, ESC differentiation is accompanied by genome-wide commitment to euchromatin or heterochromatin. Undifferentiated hESCs bivalently modify the brachyury locus, activate it to euchromatin during mesoderm induction, and subsequently repress it to heterochromatin, demonstrating, to our knowledge, the first analysis of chromatin dynamics at a locus essential for mesoderm and endoderm differentiation.</str>

Previously, we performed linkage analysis using microsatellite (STR) markers on 3 unrelated chordoma kindreds (16 patients with chordoma) and reported significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 7q33 (Z(max) = 4.78) with a minimal disease gene region of 11 cM. In our present study, we performed linkage analysis in these 3 families using chromosome 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Parametric and nonparametric multipoint analyses showed significant linkage to 7q markers with p &lt; 0.001 and Z(max) = 2.77, respectively. The minimal disease gene region was not reduced by combined SNP and STR haplotype analysis compared to the previous STR haplotype analysis alone. We genotyped members of a fourth chordoma family with SNP and STR markers for chromosome 7q and for 1p36, the location of a previously reported chordoma locus. Affected members of this family did not share a common haplotype on 7q, and the family did not show evidence of linkage to 1p36. Thus, we corroborated a chordoma locus on chromosome 7q in the 3 original families and demonstrated evidence for genetic heterogeneity in the fourth family. Our study also provided insights into some limitations and analytical complexities associated with using a dense SNP marker set in linkage analysis of complex pedigrees.</str>

      <str>Skull base chondrosarcoma and chordoma are rare tumors that generally have a poor prognosis. In 1973, Heffelfinger et al described a chondroid variant of chordoma, called chondroid chordoma that was found to have a significantly better prognosis than classic chordoma. However, recent evidence suggests that many of the tumors diagnosed as chondroid chordoma may, in fact, be low-grade myxoid chondrosarcomas. This report presents the diagnosis and treatment of two cases of skull base tumor that were diagnosed preoperatively as schwannoma because they were thought initially to be centred on the jugular foramen. Initial histologic evaluation suggested chondroid chordoma, but immunohistologic techniques and a review of the literature led to a diagnosis of low-grade myxoid chondrosarcoma.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a relatively rare, locally aggressive tumor which is known to arise from embryonic remnants of the notochord and to occur exclusively along the spinal axis, with a predilection for the sacrum. Although chordoma typically presents as a single lesion, a few cases of metastasis have been reported and the prognosis of such patients may be poor. Chordomas are slowly growing tumors with insidious onset of symptoms, making early diagnosis difficult. Recent improvements in imaging have provided valuable information for early diagnosis. The optimal treatment for sacral chordoma is en bloc sacral resection with wide surgical margins. Improvement in surgical techniques has widened the opportunities to provide effective treatment. However, the effects of adjuvant treatment options are still both unclear and controversial. Substantial progress has been made in the study of molecular-targeted therapy. The authors review the current surgical and adjuvant treatment modalities, including molecular-targeted therapy, available for management of sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>Sacrococcygeal chordoma is a rare malignant neoplasm situated in a location adjacent to important structures. Distant metastases are usually rare and occur late. The treatment of choice usually consists of radical surgery, sometimes followed by radiotherapy. Extensive surgical resection is difficult and often causes bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, and the local recurrence rate remains high. In an attempt to diminish both risks, the authors introduced cryosurgery in situ as a new treatment modality for chordoma in the sacrococcygeal region. From 1974 to 1980, four patients (two male, two female) with sacrococcygeal chordoma were treated with cryosurgery without resection. Two patients had extensive tumors (greater than 10 cm) and could be treated only palliatively. Two other patients with smaller tumors (less than 10 cm) had radical cryosurgical treatment. Both patients are disease-free 10 and 7 years after cryosurgical treatment. One of the palliatively treated patients is alive with local recurrence 4 years after cryosurgery, the other died of tumor after 5 years. In a cryosurgical lesion, the tissue is completely devitalized; however, the architecture of the tissue in peripheral nerves, large vessels, and bone is preserved and remains as a perfect autograft. Frozen tissue is very susceptible to the hematogenous spread of infection. Therefore, infection prevention is of utmost importance. The authors believe that cryosurgery should have a place in the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma.</str>

      <str>The majority of chordomas show activation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Based on in vitro intertumoral variation in response to recombinant PDGF protein and PDGFR inhibition, and variable tumor response to imatinib, we hypothesized that chordomas resistant to PDGFR inhibition may possess downstream activation of the pathway.</str>
      <str>Molecular profiling was performed on 23 consecutive chordoma primary tissue specimens. Primary cultures established from 20 of the 23 specimens, and chordoma cell lines, UCH-1 and UCH-2, were used for in vitro experiments.</str>
      <str>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) locus was observed in 6 specimens (26%). PTEN disruption statistically correlated with increased Ki-67 proliferation index, an established marker of poor outcome for chordoma. Compared to wild type, PTEN deficient chordomas displayed increased proliferative rate, and responded less favorably to PDGFR inhibition. PTEN gene restoration abrogated this growth advantage. Chordomas are characterized by intratumoral hypoxia and local invasion, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are capable of attenuating both hypoxic signaling and cell migration. The combination of PDGFR and HDAC inhibition effectively disrupted growth and invasion of PTEN deficient chordoma cells.</str>
      <str>Loss of heterozygosity of the PTEN gene seen in a subset of chordomas is associated with aggressive in vitro behavior and strongly correlates with increased Ki-67 proliferative index.

      <str>The prognosis of pediatric chordomas is difficult to predict based on histology. The objective of this study was to assess the expression of a proliferation marker and adhesion molecules in pediatric chordomas and relate the expressions to outcome. In 8 pediatric chordomas, we calculated the MIB-1 labeling index (LI) by counting the number of MIB-1-positive tumor cells in 100 tumor cells. The grade of expression of E-cadherin and CD44 was calculated by estimating the percentage of tumor cells expressing these markers. MIB-1 LI correlated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.007) and low survival rate (P = 0.007). The expression of E-cadherin correlated with disease-free survival (P = 0.009), tumor recurrence (P &gt; 0.0007), and low survival rate (P &gt; 0.0007). CD44 expression did not correlate with recurrence (P = 0.056) or survival rate (P = 0.056). Our results suggest that MIB-1 LI and expression of E-cadherin are helpful to predict outcome in pediatric chordomas.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are relatively rare tumors that arise from the neuraxis. Most often, chordomas are single lesions that metastasize late. There have been very few cases of chordomas arising from multiple foci along the neuraxis. Here, we present a case of a multicentric chordoma.</str>
      <str>The patient presented with pain in her right neck and soreness in her right shoulder that she had experienced for about 2.5 years that she attributed to a muscle strain. She experienced worsening of her symptoms, which prompted her to seek medical care. The patient underwent an occiput-to-C6 posterolateral fusion with autograft and an occiput-to-C6 posterior segmental instrumentation, along with decompression of the spinal cord. One month after the initial surgery, the patient underwent a second surgery. The C2 and C3 vertebral bodies were completely resected, and a C1-C4 anterior fusion was then carried out. A C5 vertebrectomy and C4-C6 fusion were also performed at this time. The patient then received proton beam radiation to the entire affected area.</str>
      <str>Recent studies have suggested that chordomas arise from benign notochordal tumors. We suggest that our patient suffered from multicentric chordomas with possible benign notochordal tumors.

      <str>Treatment of upper cervical chordoma is generally considered to be difficult one, because of serious troubles in supporting cranio-spinal junction after the surgery and at the recurrence. Clinical course of a 22-year-old man with chordoma originated from C2 vertebral body was reported, and the operation for such a condition were discussed with emphasis on the mode of craniovertebral fixation. Simple subtotal removal of the vertebral chordoma was carried out by posterior approach at the first operation. The second one was necessary fourteen months later for recurrence of the tumor. At the second surgery, in addition to the tumor removal, posterior fusion between the occipital bone and the C4 lamina was performed with homologous iliac bone graft, the center of which was kept slightly lateral to the lesion. This procedure of fixation not only enabled a sufficient removal of the residual tumor without loosening the bone graft, but also shortened the bedridden time following the subsequent operations for the recurrence, and finally resulted in an excellent recovery in his clinical symptoms. It is considered to be important to select the most adequate approach of surgery, including fixation technique, according to the extension of the tumor. We would emphasize the usefulness of paramedian posterior fusion of the cranio-spinal junction for such a condition of wide tumor invasion in the high cervical region.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare bone tumor that originates from the remnants of the notochord. These tumors have axial distribution particularly at the upper and lower ends of the vertebral column. This paper reports a rare occurrence of a chordoma in the posterior elements of the L5 vertebra. A differential diagnosis of a benign tumor (giant cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst or osteoblastoma) was made initially. Other differential diagnoses included plasmacytoma and metastasis. The tumor was removed enbloc. Histopathological examination revealed the tumor mass to be chordoma. There were no clinical or radiological signs of recurrence at 21 months follow-up. Chordomas are tumors of the axial skeleton. However, they may occur in unusual sites in ectopic notochordal tissue. The case is being presented for its unusual site of occurrence.</str>

      <str>Differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells transiently express an endogenous activity capable of inducing Pax-3 expression in adjacent P19 stem cells (Pruitt, Development 116, 573-583, 1992). In the present study, expression of this activity in mesodermal cell lineages is demonstrated. First, expression of the mesodermal marker Brachyury correlates with expression of Pax-3-inducing activity. Second, the ability of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to block mesoderm differentiation at two different points is demonstrated and correlated with the inhibition of Pax-3-inducing activity. Finally, two mesodermal cell lines that express Pax-3-inducing activity were derived from P19 EC cells. Each of these lines expresses high levels of the mesodermal marker Brachyury and high levels of Oct-3/4 (which is down-regulated at early times during mesoderm differentiation) suggesting that these lines are early mesodermal derivatives. Unlike EC or embryonic stem cell lines, each of the two mesodermal derivatives autoinduces Hox gene expression on aggregation even in the presence of LIF. Following aggregation, anterior-specific genes are expressed more rapidly than more posterior genes. These observations directly demonstrate the ability of murine mesodermal derivatives to autoinduce Hox gene expression in the absence of signals from other cell lineages. Similar to the Pax-3-inducing activity, signals from mesodermal cell lines were sufficient to induce HOX expression in adjacent P19 stem cells in cell mixing assays. These observations are consistent with the previous suggestion (Blum, M., Gaunt, S. J., Cho, K. W. Y., Steinbeisser, H., Blumberg, B., Bittner, D. and De Robertis, E. M. (1992) Cell 69, 1097-1106) that signals responsible for anterior-posterior organizer activity are localized to the anterior primitive streak mesoderm of the mouse embryo.</str>

      <str>Prolyl 4-hydroxylase is the key enzyme of synthesis of collagens. Hydroxylation of a sufficient number of proline residues to hydroxyproline is necessary for the stability of triple helices in collagenous proteins, because non-hydroxylated non-triple-helical collagen polypeptide chains are degraded intracellularly. We studied 15 primary chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas, 17 benign bone tumours and one case of fibrous dysplasia and chordoma using immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against the alpha(I) and alpha(II) subunits of type I and II prolyl 4-hydroxylases, and with antibodies against collagen types I and II. Type I prolyl 4-hydroxylase was found to be the predominant isoenzyme in both types of bone sarcoma, whereas the type II enzyme was more readily expressed by benign tumours. A feature of collagen staining, that was common to both sarcoma types, was that collagen types I and II were mainly found within cancer cells and were rarely present extracellularly. Extracellular collagen staining was more obvious in benign tumours. The results show that expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase isoenzymes is altered in bone sarcomas as compared with normal bone tissue. Chondrous cells, which normally express mainly the type II isoenzyme, switch their expression pattern to that of type I. The findings provide evidence that type I is the major isoenzyme in malignant bone tumours, and probably in malignant neoplasms in general. The pattern of enzyme expression is considered to be associated with dedifferentiation of cancer cells.</str>

Pathologic analysis revealed a tumor composed of lobules of cells with variably vacuolated cytoplasm (physaliphorous cells) separated by fibrous septa, predominantly arranged in peculiar small or large alveolar structures. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin 8/18, S-100 protein and vimentin. The patient is well and without recurrence 20 months after surgery.</str>

      <str>The expression of c-met proto-oncogene product (c-MET) has been reported to be related to invasive growth or tumor stage in some tumors, but little is known concerning the significance of c-MET expression in bone tumors. With use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and polyclonal antibody for c-MET, we studied the expression of c-MET in 122 cases of malignant bone tumors (43 osteosarcomas, 24 chondrosarcomas, 21 malignant fibrous histiocytomas of bone, 16 Ewing's sarcoma versus primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 18 chordomas), 65 cases of benign tumors and tumor-like lesions (including 8 giant cell tumors of bone, 8 chondroblastomas, 12 enchondromas, 7 osteochondromas, 10 fibrous dysplasias), 7 cases of articular cartilaginous tissue, and 10 cases of fetal vertebral tissue consisting of foci of enchondral ossification and notochordal tissue. In malignant tumors, c-MET expression was most frequently detected in chordoma (94.4%), followed by chondrosarcoma (54.2%) and osteosarcoma (23.3%). Among the osteosarcoma specimens, c-MET expression was frequently detected in the chondroblastic subtype (66.7%), but the incidence was low in the cases with other subtypes of osteosarcoma. We found no significant correlation between the c-MET expression and the histologic grade of malignancy in either osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. c-MET expression was either rarely observed or completely negative in malignant fibrous histiocytomas of bone (4.8%) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (0%). In benign tumors and tumor-like lesions, c-MET expression was frequently detected in cartilaginous tumors, such as chondroblastoma (62.5%), enchondroma (66.7%), and osteochondroma (71.4%), but no expression was observed in giant cell tumors of bone or any other benign tumors or tumor-like lesions. In normal tissue, c-MET expression was frequently detected in the articular cartilage (100%) and notochord (70.0%) specimens examined. We conclude that c-MET expression as frequent as that observed in the notochordal tissue, chordomas, articular cartilage, and cartilaginous tumors is related to the development of both normal tissue and chondroid tumors.</str>

      <str>Most mammals possess a tail, humans and the Great Apes being notable exceptions. One approach to understanding the mechanisms and evolutionary forces influencing development of a tail is to identify the genetic factors that influence extreme tail length variation within a species. In mice, the Tailless locus has proven to be complex, with evidence of multiple different genes and mutations with pleiotropic effects on tail length, fertility, embryogenesis, male transmission ratio, and meiotic recombination. Five cat breeds have abnormal tail length phenotypes: the American Bobtail, the Manx, the Pixie-Bob, the Kurilian Bobtail, and the Japanese Bobtail. We sequenced the T gene in several independent lineages of Manx cats from both the US and the Isle of Man and identified three 1-bp deletions and one duplication/deletion, each predicted to cause a frameshift that leads to premature termination and truncation of the carboxy terminal end of the Brachyury protein. Ninety-five percent of Manx cats with short-tail phenotypes were heterozygous for T mutations, mutant alleles appeared to be largely lineage-specific, and a maximum LOD score of 6.21 with T was obtained at a recombination fraction (Θ) of 0.00. One mutant T allele was shared with American Bobtails and Pixie-Bobs; both breeds developed more recently in the US. The ability of mutant Brachyury protein to activate transcription of a downstream target was substantially lower than wild-type protein. Collectively, these results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Brachyury is one mechanism underlying variable tail length in domesticated cats. </str>

Their accurate diagnosis is usually a challenge and it is of utmost importance to identify chordomas because of the poorer prognosis. Even if the topography of the tumor is suggestive (median versus lateral), modern imaging is not specific enough and the diagnosis is based on histological features. We report nine cases of myxoid bone tumors of the skull including four chordomas, one chondroid chordoma and four chondrosarcomas. Smears are useful for rapid intraoperative diagnosis. Chondrosarcomas show cords of small round cells in a myxoid background while chordomas are made of multilayered sheets of larger, often vacuolated cells. Histology shows areas of cartilaginous matrix associated with myxoid areas in chondrosarcomas and in chondroid chordomas.

The origin of IH is unclear, but it has been shown to express markers of both endothelial and haematopoietic lineages, and a role for endothelial progenitor cells in the aetiology of IH has been suggested. Haemangioblasts are precursors of both endothelial and haematopoietic cells, and their characterisation has identified the expression of cell surface and intracellular proteins that collectively can be used for assigning a haemangioblast phenotype.</str>
      <str>The authors used immunohistochemical staining to characterise the expression of primitive haematopoietic-associated proteins in proliferating IHs.</str>
      <str>The authors show that the cells forming the capillary endothelium express markers associated with primitive haematopoietic cells. Additionally, many of these cells express the transcription factors brachyury and GATA-2, indicating a primitive mesodermal origin. They hypothesise that the immature capillaries in IH are derived from primitive mesodermal cells with haemangioblastic differentiation capabilities. The expression of primitive mesodermal, endothelial and haematopoietic markers by the cells forming the endothelium suggests that the immature capillaries that predominate in proliferating IH are a haemogenic endothelium phenotype, derived from haemangioblasts.</str>

      <str>Chordoma, a rare cancer, is usually treated with surgery and/or radiation. However, very limited characterizations of chordoma cells are available due to a minimal availability (only two lines validated by now) and the extremely long doubling time. In order to overcome this situation, we successfully derived a cell line with a shorter doubling time from the first validated chordoma line U-CH1 and obtained invaluable cell biological data.</str>
      <str>After isolating a subpopulation of U-CH1 cells with a short doubling time (U-CH1-N), cell growth, cell cycle distribution, DNA content, chromosome number, p53 status, and cell survival were examined after exposure to X-rays, heavy ions, camptothecin, mitomycin C, cisplatin and bleocin. These data were compared with those of HeLa (cervical cancer) and U87-MG (glioblastoma) cells.</str>
      <str>The cell doubling times for HeLa, U87-MG and U-CH1-N were approximately 18 h, 24 h and 3 days respectively. Heavy ion irradiation resulted in more efficient cell killing than x-rays in all three cell lines. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at 10% survival for U-CH1-N was about 2.45 for 70 keV/μm carbon and 3.86 for 200 keV/μm iron ions. Of the four chemicals, bleocin showed the most marked cytotoxic effect on U-CH1-N.</str>
      <str>Our data provide the first comprehensive cellular characterization using cells of chordoma origin and furnish the biological basis for successful clinical results of chordoma treatment by heavy ions.</str>

      <str>Two recurrences of a familial clivus chordoma, arisen from a patient who developed the primary tumor at age of 8 years, were investigated by cytogenetic and the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach. Of the patient's 3 daughters, 2 developed, respectively, a clivus chordoma and an astrocytoma in infancy, a familial aggregation highly suggestive of a genetic background. After a 31-year hiatus, 2 tumor recurrences, developed over 17 months, were removed surgically. Both were hypo- or nearly diploid, and had a pronounced karyotypic heterogeneity with clonal and non-clonal rearrangements affecting several chromosomes. The same rearrangement, a dic(1;9)(p36.1;p21), was shared in both tumor specimens and, in 90% of the cells, chromosome 1p appeared to be involved in unbalanced translocations with different chromosomes, leading to variable losses of 1p. Previous cytogenetic data concerning chordoma are limited to 10 sporadic tumors with an abnormal karyotype; although no tumor-specific rearrangements have been identified, chromosome 1p appears to be involved frequently.</str>

      <str>A detailed study of the expression pattern of embryonic fibroblast growth factor (eFGF) during early Xenopus development has been undertaken using whole-mount DIG in situ hybridization. We show that the zygotic expression of eFGF is activated in the mesoderm of the early gastrula and is first visualized as a ring around the blastopore, with significantly higher levels of expression on the dorsal side of the embryo. As gastrulation proceeds, eFGF transcripts become increasingly abundant in the dorsal blastopore lip. In the early neurula eFGF expression can be detected in the extreme posterior of the embryo around the closed blastopore and in the cells of the notochord. This latter result is significant and represents the first report of a Xenopus FGF that is expressed in the notochord. In addition, we show that during gastrula and neurula stages, expression of eFGF closely follows the expression of the Xenopus brachyury (Xbra) gene. During later development eFGF expression is localized to the tail-bud region and a stripe at the mid-brain/hind-brain junction. These data provide further evidence that FGFs play an important role in regulating the expression of brachyury in the developing mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Mutations in the mouse Brachyury (T) gene are characterized by a dominant reduction of tail length and recessive lethality. Two quantitative trait loci, Brachyury-modifier 1 and 2 (Brm1 and Brm2) are defined by alleles that enhance the short-tail Brachyury phenotype. Here we report on a genetic analysis of a visible dominant mutation Abnormal feet and tail (Aft) located in the vicinity of Brm1. Affected animals display kinky tails and syndactyly in the hindlimbs, both likely resulting from a defect in apoptosis. We observed an unusual genetic incompatibility between Aft and certain genetic backgrounds. We show that Aft and T are likely to interact genetically, since some double heterozygotes are tailless. In addition to the tail and hindlimb phenotypes, Aft-bearing mutants display characteristic late-onset skin lesions. We therefore tested for allelism between Aft and a closely linked recessive mutation rough coat (rc) and found that these two mutations are likely nonallelic. Our results provide a valuable resource for the study of mammalian skin development and contribute to the genetic analysis of Brachyury function.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for formation of posterior mesoderm and for axial development in both mouse and zebrafish embryos. In this paper, we first show that the Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, and the zebrafish homologue, no tail (ntl), both function as transcription activators. The activation domains of both proteins map to their carboxy terminal regions, and we note that the activation domain is absent in two zebrafish Brachyury mutations, suggesting that it is required for gene function. A dominant-interfering Xbra construct was generated by replacing the activation domain of Xbra with the repressor domain of the Drosophila engrailed protein. Microinjection of RNA encoding this fusion protein allowed us to generate Xenopus and zebrafish embryos which show striking similarities to genetic mutants in mouse and fish. These results indicate that the function of Brachyury during vertebrate gastrulation is to activate transcription of mesoderm-specific genes. Additional experiments show that Xbra transcription activation is required for regulation of Xbra itself in dorsal, but not ventral, mesoderm. The approach described in this paper, in which the DNA-binding domain of a transcription activator is fused to the engrailed repressor domain, should assist in the analysis of other Xenopus and zebrafish transcription factors.</str>

      <str>The notochord is a defining feature of the chordate body plan. Experiments in ascidian, frog and mouse embryos have shown that co-expression of Brachyury and FoxA class transcription factors is required for notochord development. However, studies on the cis-regulatory sequences mediating the synergistic effects of these transcription factors are complicated by the limited knowledge of notochord genes and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that are directly targeted by both. We have identified an easily testable model for such investigations in a 155-bp notochord-specific CRM from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. This CRM contains functional binding sites for both Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and FoxA (Ci-FoxA-a). By combining point mutation analysis and misexpression experiments, we demonstrate that binding of both transcription factors to this CRM is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription. To gain insights into the cis-regulatory criteria controlling its activity, we investigated the organization of the transcription factor binding sites within the 155-bp CRM. The 155-bp sequence contains two Ci-Bra binding sites with identical core sequences but opposite orientations, only one of which is required for enhancer activity. Changes in both orientation and spacing of these sites substantially affect the activity of the CRM, as clusters of identical sites found in the Ciona genome with different arrangements are unable to activate transcription in notochord cells. This work presents the first evidence of a synergistic interaction between Brachyury and FoxA in the activation of an individual notochord CRM, and highlights the importance of transcription factor binding site arrangement for its function.</str>

This case report describes a 6-year-old girl with a mass in her left forearm measuring 11 x 6 cm. Foci of moderate nuclear atypia and various areas of necrosis were found in the tumor. Lung metastases were detected 3 months after diagnosis. Immunophenotyping revealed a strong, diffuse expression of pancytokeratin, S-100 protein, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and focal expression of chromogranin A. This is the fifth documented report on cases of metastasized parachordomas. It is rare for these neoplasms to show such aggressive behavior; moreover, immunoreactivity to chromogranin A is unexpected in these tumors.

      <str>Miz1 is a member of the POZ domain/zinc finger transcription factor family. In vivo, Miz1 forms a complex with the Myc oncoprotein and recruits Myc to core promoter elements. Myc represses transcription through Miz1 binding sites. We now show that the Miz1 gene is ubiquitously expressed during mouse embryogenesis. In order to elucidate the physiological function of Miz1, we have deleted the mouse Miz1 gene by homologous recombination. Miz1(+/-) mice are indistinguishable from wild-type animals; in contrast, Miz1(-/-) embryos are not viable. They are severely retarded in early embryonic development and do not undergo normal gastrulation. Expression of Goosecoid and Brachyury is detectable in Miz1(-/-) embryos, suggesting that Miz1 is not required for signal transduction by Nodal. Expression of p21Cip1, a target gene of Miz1 is unaltered; in contrast, expression of p57Kip2, another target gene of Miz1 is absent in Miz1(-/-) embryos. Miz1(-/-) embryos succumb to massive apoptosis of ectodermal cells around day 7.5 of embryonic development.

      <str>Expression of the Brachyury (Ci-Bra) gene of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis is initiated at the 64-cell stage. Gene expression is restricted to notochord precursor cells, and Ci-Bra plays a key role in notochord differentiation. In a previous study, nearly 50 cDNA clones for potential Ci-Bra-downstream genes that are expressed in notochord cells were isolated. The present determination, by whole-mount in situ hybridization, of the temporal expression patterns of 19 notochord-specific and 20 notochord-predominant genes demonstrated that the timings of initiation of the expression of various genes was not identical. The expression of several genes was initiated as early as the gastrula stage. However, the expression of most of the notochord-specific genes commenced at the neural plate stage. Partial nucleotide sequence data of these clones suggest that genes expressed earlier encode potential transcriptional factors and/or nuclear proteins, while those expressed later encode proteins implicated in cell adhesion, signal transduction, regulation of the cytoskeleton, and components of the extracellular matrix. These gene activities may be associated with changes in cell shape and adhesion during the intercalation and extension of the notochord cells.</str>

      <str>Insight regarding mechanisms controlling gene expression in the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) will improve our understanding of the processes regulating spermatogenesis and aid in treating problems associated with male infertility. In the present study, we explored the global gene expression profiles of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-regulated transcription factors Ets (E-twenty-six) variant gene 5 (Etv5); B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 6, member B (Bcl6b); and POU domain, class-3 transcription factor 1 (Pou3f1). We reasoned that these three factors may function as a core set of transcription factors, regulating genes responsible for maintaining the SSC population. Using transient siRNA oligonucleotides to individually target Etv5, Bcl6b, and Pou3f1 within mouse SSC cultures, we examined changes to the global gene expression profiles associated with these transcription factors. Only modest overlaps in the target genes regulated by the three factors were noted, but ETV5 was found to be a critical downstream regulator of GDNF signaling that mediated the expression of several known SSC self-renewal related genes, including Bcl6b and LIM homeobox 1 (Lhx1). Notably, ETV5 was identified as a regulator of Brachyury (T) and CXC chemokine receptor, type 4 (Cxcr4), and we showed that ETV5 binding to the Brachyury (T) gene promoter region is associated with an active state of transcription. Moreover, in vivo transplantation of SSCs following silencing of Brachyury (T) significantly reduced the number of donor cell-derived colonies formed within recipient mouse testes. These results suggest Brachyury is of biological importance and functions as part of GDNF/ETV5 signaling to promote self-renewal of mouse SSCs cultured in vitro.</str>

      <str>The prognosis of chordomas is difficult to predict based solely on histological findings. The purpose of this study was to assess the immunohistochemical expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 antigen and the expression of p53 in skull base chordomas and to relate their expressions to the outcome. We examined the expression of p53 and the MIB-1 labeling index (LI), assessed by Ki-67 expression, in 19 tumors (initial, n = 11; recurrent, n = 8) from 11 patients. The correlation among the MIB-1 LI, p53 expression, and the clinical outcome was analyzed. The mean MIB-1 LI and p53 expression at the initial surgery were 5.6 +/- 4.6% and 9.0 +/- 9.4%, respectively. At the time of recurrence, the mean MIB-1 LI and p53 expression were 10.2 +/- 7.4% and 16.5 +/- 12.0%. The correlation between the MIB-1 LI and p53 expression at the initial and recurrent surgeries was highly significant (r = 0.948; P &lt; 0.0001). The change in p53 expression from the initial to the recurrent chordomas was significantly greater in patients who died of tumor-related causes than in the surviving patients. In the surviving patients, the values for MIB-1 LI and p53 expression in the recurrent tumors were significantly higher in the disease-ongoing group than in the disease-free group. Our results suggest that determination of the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and Ki-67 antigen is helpful to predict tumor recurrence and prognosis in skull base chordomas.</str>

      <str>Lumbosacral chordomas are rare skeletal sarcomas of the spine that originate from the remnant notochord. The understanding of this human cancer is limited to observations of its clinical behavior and its embryonic link. Thus, we performed chromosome and molecular analyses from five surgically harvested chordomas in an effort to document genetic and biochemical abnormalities which might aid in understanding the tumor biology of this understudied neoplasm. Cytogenetic analysis of the five chordomas revealed normal results in four patients and random abnormalities in only one tumor cell in the 100 cells studied from the fifth patient. A repeat telomeric probe (TTAGGG)50 was hybridized to genomic DNA isolated from chordoma cells (and HeLa cells) and digested with HinfI. The tumor DNA was paired with leukocyte DNA from age-matched controls and revealed telomere elongation in four of the four chordoma patients studied with molecular genetic techniques. Conversely, telomere length reduction has been reported during in vitro senescence of human fibroblasts, giant cell tumor of bone, colon cancer, intracranial tumors, childhood leukemia, Wilms tumor, and in HeLa cells. Telomerase activity (telomerase is required to maintain telomere integrity) was also determined by visualizing the extension of radioactive telomeric repeats on DNA sequencing gels. The telomeric fragments were assembled during incubation of the cytoplasmic extract containing telomerase. Telomerase activity was observed in HeLa (positive control and commercially available cell line), giant cell tumor of bone (positive control tumor cells from living patients), and in chordoma cells from one of the two chordoma patients (but to a lesser degree compared with HeLa). As expected, the chordoma patients' fibroblasts exhibited no telomerase activity.</str>

We performed a genomewide analysis for linkage in a family with 10 individuals affected by chordoma. The maximum two-point LOD score based on only the affected individuals was 2.21, at recombination fraction 0, at marker D7S2195 on chromosome 7q. Combined analysis of additional members of this family (11 affected individuals) and of two unrelated families (one with 2 affected individuals and the other with 3 affected individuals), with 20 markers on 7q, showed a maximum two-point LOD score of 4.05 at marker D7S500. Multipoint analysis based on only the affected individuals gave a maximum LOD score of 4.78, with an approximate 2-LOD support interval from marker D7S512 to marker D7S684. Haplotype analysis of the three families showed a minimal disease-gene region from D7S512 to D7S684, a distance of 11.1 cM and approximately 7.1 Mb.

Chordoma has been described in laboratory animals such as dogs, rats, minks, and ferrets. This report describes a case of a chordoma in the tail of a ferret. Grossly, a grayish-white, expansile, subcutaneous soft-tissue mass was observed in the tail. Histopathologically, the mass was a loosely placed, nodular, unencapsulated neoplasm within the dermis. In the mass, tumor lobules were intermingled with fibrous tissues. Fibrous tissues contained abundant extracellular basophilic material that was consistent with mucin. The tumor was composed of a close pack of adipocyte-like vacuolated cells (physaliferous cells). The cells were centrally or eccentrically located round nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm with large vacuoles. Immunohistologically, neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin and S-100 protein. Based on histopathologic findings and special staining characteristics, this case was diagnosed as chordoma.</str>

Surgical removal of the tumor is the primary modality of treatment. Surgical resection is carried out using a combined abdominal and trans-sacral approach. Complete tumoral resection is limited by preservation of sacral stability and urinary and fecal continence. Many patients are referred for radiation therapy after subtotal resection.

Differential diagnosis are chondroma or chondrosarcoma and epidermoid cyst. Histology with evidence of a chondroid matrix explain the CT and MR appearance. In this localisation, there is no case reported in the litterature. This is an outstanding case because its extra-osseous localization with a lack of contrast enhancement after injection and its unusual histologic pattern.</str>

      <str>The bone scan features of different types of sacral tumors in 16 patients were assessed. Four out of five patients with chordoma, the most common sacral tumor, demonstrated either reduced uptake or normal distribution of isotope at the site of this midline tumor. Plasmacytoma, which is not usually central, also caused reduced uptake on the bone scan. Ewing's sarcoma gave no consistent pattern. All other tumors caused increased uptake except for one unusual case of osteogenic sarcoma. Bone scintigraphy can be very useful in the assessment of sacral tumors. A midline sacral tumor that is cold on the bone scan is very likely to be a chordoma.</str>

The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway is important for cell signalling, and attractive for selective inhibition.

      <str>Chordoma is a rare low-grade malignant neoplasm derived from the remnants of the embryonic notochord. This locally invasive neoplasm is subject to recurrence after treatment. The median survival time is estimated to be 6.3 years. Various treatment approaches have been attempted, including radical excision, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Treatment outcome is significantly influenced by the size and site of the chordoma. Recently, Imatinib, a molecular-targeted agent, has been shown to have antitumor activity in chordoma. Proton radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy have also been used. Surgical treatment is still the primary choice for chordoma. It has become more aggressive in recent years, evolving from intralesional or partial excision to en bloc resection. However, upper cervical localizations make such en bloc resection in most cases not possible. We present and discuss the therapeutic challenges of a young female with large retropharyngeal chordoma who presented to our institution after conventional photon beam radiotherapy. This C2/3 tumor was classified IB according to the Enneking classification. It distributed to layers A-D and sectors 1-6 according to the Weinstein Boriani Biagini Classification. The left vertebral artery (VA) was encapsulated and displaced. One stage intralesional extracapsular tumor excision and reconstruction was achieved by combined bilateral high anterior cervical approaches and posterior approach. No recurrence or metastasis was observed 3 years after the operation. She returned to her previous occupation as office worker.</str>

      <str>To provide the first insights into the potential role of skull base chordoma, which causes brainstem compression in and around Barrington's nucleus and its effect on the micturition center. Chordoma is a rare malignant bone tumor that originates from the remnants of the embryonic notochord, which normally forms and dissolves during early fetal development. Although it is a slowly growing tumor, it displays local invasive growth.</str>
      <str>Urodynamic testing of 22 symptomatic patients was performed. All women and men with skull base chordoma treated in 2 hospitals in Germany between 1986 and 2007 were studied. Follow-up periods ranged from 6 months to 10 years. Lower urinary tract symptoms were documented in patients with acute brainstem compression because of local chordoma growth.</str>
      <str>Of 74 patients treated, 22 (7 women, 15 men) with a median age of 37 years were evaluated with voiding diaries and computer urodynamic investigation. Urodynamic testing of 22 symptomatic patients revealed detrusor overactivity in 55%, low compliance bladder in 14%, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 45%, and uninhibited sphincter relaxation in 27%. Despite the description of incomplete emptying and urgency, 4 patients had normal urodynamic findings (18%).

      <str>Chordomas are rare bone tumors, developed from the notochord and largely resistant to chemotherapy. A special feature of this tumor is the heterogeneity of its cells. By combining high pressure freezing (HPF) with electron tomography we were able to illustrate the connections within the cells, the cell-cell interface, and the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex that appears to play a special role among the characteristics of chordoma. These lipid raft-like regions are responsible for lipid syntheses and for calcium signaling. Compared to other tumor cells, chordoma cells show a close connection of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which may influence the sphingolipid metabolism and calcium release. We quantified levels of ceramide and glycosylceramide species by the methyl tert-butyl ether extraction method and we assessed the intracellular calcium concentration with the ratiometric fluorescent dye Fura-2AM. Measurements of the changes in the intracellular calcium concentration revealed an increase in calcium due to the application of acetylcholine. With regard to lipid synthesis, glucosylceramide levels in the chordoma cell line were significantly higher than those in normal healthy cells. The accumulation of glycosylceramide in drug resistant cancer cells has been confirmed in many types of cancer and may also account for drug resistance in chordoma. This study aimed to provide a deep morphological description of chordoma cells, it demonstrated that HPF analysis is useful in elucidating detailed structural information. Furthermore we demonstrate how an accumulation of glycosylceramide in chordoma provides links to drug resistance and opens up the field for new research options. </str>

      <str>Chordoma, a distinct malignant neoplasm arising from the remnants of the notochord, occurs mostly in patients in the fifth to seventh decade of life. Metastasis occurs in 20-30% of cases. The most common metastatic sites are lungs and, less commonly, other bones and visceral organs. The cytologic features of chordoma in both primary and metastatic foci have been described for specimens obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy. A few cases have been reported in the sputum and the cerebrospinal fluid.</str>
      <str>A 57-year-old man presented with metastatic chordoma diagnosed in a peritoneal effusion. Cytospin slides of the effusion showed numerous individual and clusters of polygonal, round epithelial cells with a background of myxoid chondroid substance, which stained metachromatic on Diff-Quik slides. Many diagnostic physaliphorous cells were present and characterized by abundant intracytoplasmic vacuoles of various sizes. The nuclei were monotonous, with minimal anisonucleosis. The nuclei had evenly dispersed chromatin with occasional small, eosinophilic nucleoli. The nuclear membranes were smooth, with focal indentation. The differential diagnosis included an adenocarcinoma and metastatic chordoma. Immunohistochemistry applied to the cell block showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for cytokeratin and S-100 protein.</str>

      <str>Follistatin is a secreted protein, which functions as an antagonist of different members of the TGF-beta superfamily, including activin and bone morphogenetic proteins. Expression of follistatin is tightly regulated during mouse development both spatially and temporally. In order to study the regulation of follistatin expression in the mouse embryo we have cloned and analyzed part of the 5' flanking region of the murine follistatin gene. Primer extension and RNase protection assays demonstrate that the murine follistatin promoter region has at least three distinct transcription initiation sites, which are each preceded by a TATA box. All of the transcription initiation sites are located within the first 500 bp upstream of the translational start site. Sequence analysis of this 500 bp region revealed several consensus binding sites for transcription factors including AP-1, Brachyury-T, CREB, Sp1, AP-2 and Tcf. To test whether the 5' region displays promoter activity, we transfected various 5' flanking region deletion constructs into F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and into P19 EC cells. In these two cell lines a region of only 262 bp upstream of the translation start site could drivereporter expression in a manner that reflects endogenous mRNA expression.</str>

      <str>As an anatomical interface between various tissues, the skull base harbors an exceptionally broad variety of neoplasms, some of which pose a major challenge for surgical pathology. The characterization of distinct immunohistochemical expression profiles and the identification of molecular genetic alterations associated with different tumor entities have significantly advanced this field. The new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the nervous system lists 15 histopathological variants of meningioma. Of clinical importance are those entities that carry an increased risk of recurrence and a poor prognosis, i.e., the atypical meningioma (WHO grade II), clear-cell meningioma (WHO grade II), chordoid meningioma (WHO grade II), rhabdoid meningioma (WHO grade III), papillary meningioma (WHO grade III), and anaplastic meningioma (WHO grade III). Diagnostic criteria for atypical and anaplastic meningioma variants have now been stringently defined. The differential diagnosis of meningiomas includes hemangiopericytoma, hemangioblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, sarcomas, and chordoid neoplasms. Recent data highlight the importance of distinguishing chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base since chondrosarcomas show a significantly better clinical outcome. Among the less common, aggressive tumor entities in this anatomical region, infiltrating pituitary adenoma/pituitary carcinoma, superficial malignant gliomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, various sarcomas, and malignant lymphoma must be considered. Profiles of molecular genetic alterations have been established for several of these neoplasms and may facilitate the differential diagnosis. This review summarizes recent developments in the histopathological characterization, classification, and molecular pathology of neoplasms arising at the skull base.</str>

      <str>Hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that specify positional identities along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis during the development of vertebrate embryos. The earliest Hox expression in vertebrates is during gastrulation, at a position distant from the organiser or its equivalent. However, the mechanism that initiates this early expression is still not clear. Guided by the expression pattern, we identified upstream regulators in Xenopus laevis. The mesodermal transcription factor brachyury (Xbra) controls the early Hox expression domain in the animal-vegetal direction and the secreted growth factor BMP-4 limits it in the organiser/non-organiser direction. The overlap of these two signals, indicated by a Cartesian coordinate system, defines the initial Hox expression domain. We postulate that this system is a general mechanism for the activation of all Hox genes expressed during gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Previous work has demonstrated that two key melanocyte-specific elements termed the MSEu and MSEi play critical roles in the expression of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1) promoter. Both the MSEu and MSEi, located at position -237 and at the initiator, respectively, bind a melanocyte-specific factor termed MSF but are also recognized by a previously uncharacterized repressor, since mutations affecting either of these elements result in strong up-regulation of TRP-1 promoter activity in melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate that repression mediated by the MSEu and MSEi also operates in melanocytes. We also report that both the MSEu and MSEi are recognized by the brachyury-related transcription factor Tbx2, a member of the recently described T-box family, and that Tbx2 is expressed in melanocyte and melanoblast cell lines but not in melanoblast precursor cells. Although Tbx2 and MSF each recognize the TRP-1 MSEu and MSEi motifs, it is binding by Tbx-2, not binding by MSF, that correlates with repression. Several lines of evidence tend to point to the brachyury-related transcription factor Tbx2 as being the repressor of TRP-1 expression: both the MSEu and MSEi bind Tbx2, and mutations in either element that result in derepression of the TRP-1 promoter diminish binding by Tbx2; the TRP-1 promoter, but not the tyrosinase, microphthalmia, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) promoter, is repressed by Tbx2 in cotransfection assays; a high-affinity consensus brachyury/Tbx2-binding site is able to constitutively repress expression of the heterologous IE110 promoter; and a low-affinity brachyury/Tbx2 binding site is able to mediate Tbx2-dependent repression of the G3PDH promoter. Although we cannot rule out the presence of an additional, as yet unidentified factor playing a role in the negative regulation of TRP-1 in vivo, the evidence presented here suggests that Tbx2 most likely is the previously unidentified repressor of TRP-1 expression and as such is likely to represent the first example of transcriptional repression by a T-box family member.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are thought to be tumors originating from notochord remnants characterized histologically by cohesive cells with epithelial features and by immunohistochemical expression of epithelial markers. To investigate the expression and distribution of cell adhesion molecules in chordomas, we immunohistochemically studied the expression of representative cell adhesion molecules, E-cadherin, P-cadherin, N-cadherin, beta-catenin, CD44, ICAM-1 (CD54), NCAM (CD56), and VCAM-1 (CD106) in 16 tumors from 16 patients (skull base, n=5; cervical, n=2; sacral, n=9) and 3 cases of fetal notochord. Of 16 tumors, 12 (75.0%) expressed membranous immunoreactivity for NCAM, 10 (62.5%) for VCAM-1, 9 (56.3%) for CD44, 8 (50.0%) for N-cadherin, 6 (37.5%) for beta-catenin, 4 (25%) for ICAM-1, and 1 (6.3%) for P-cadherin. Nuclear staining for E-cadherin was recognized in 11 (68.8%) tumors, and membranous staining for E-cadherin in 3 (18.8%); none of the tumors showed both nuclear and membranous staining. Intranuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was not found in any chordoma. One fetal notochord case showed immunoreactivity for N-cadherin, E-cadherin (some cells showed staining in both cytoplasm and nuclei), CD44 and beta-catenin. These results indicate that chordomas frequently express immunoreactivity for multiple adhesion molecules including VCAM, CD44 and N-cadherin, as well as for NCAM and E-cadherin, as previously reported. These molecules may participate in producing the cellular cohesion evident in tumor morphological structure. Although the precise underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the high frequency of nuclear expression of E-cadherin (11 of 16 cases) may be diagnostically useful.</str>

      <str>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a major constituent of glial cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression has been accepted as a marker of astroglial differentiation or origin. However, GFAP expression has been demonstrated in a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues outside the central nervous system, including pleomorphic adenomas, chordomas, bone, and cartilage. It has been postulated that coexpression of GFAP and vimentin in neoplastic myoepithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas reflects early chondroid differentiation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in chondromyxoid and chordoid tumors was studied in formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 20 pleomorphic adenomas and 10 chordomas by the immunoperoxidase method with the use of commercially available monoclonal (n = 2) and polyclonal (n = 1) antibodies. All pleomorphic adenomas and chordomas demonstrated expression of GFAP with the use of the polyclonal antibody (Biomeda Corp [Foster City, Calif]). Variable expression of GFAP was present in 90% (18/20) and 70% (14/20) of pleomorphic adenomas, and in 20% (2/10) and 0% of chordomas, with the use of the two monoclonal preparations (Dakopatts [Glostrup, Denmark] and BioGenex Laboratories [San Ramon, Calif]), respectively. Normal brain tissue and eight astrocytomas were used as "controls" to compare staining intensity and quality between the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFAP antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity with the polyclonal antibody was more intense than that with either monoclonal antibody despite similar (congruent) distributions of tumor cell types that were stained in control brain and astrocytoma tissues. The GFAP polyclonal antibody was more frequently immunoreactive than the monoclonal antibodies, particularly in cells that exhibited chondroid differentiation. These findings may have practical application in surgical pathology.</str>

      <str>Caudalization, which is proposed to be one of two functions of the amphibian organizer, initiates posterior pathways of neural development in the dorsalized ectoderm. In the absence of caudalization, dorsalized ectoderm only expresses the most anterior (archencephalic) differentiation. In the presence of caudalization, dorsalized ectorderm develops various levels of posterior neural tissues, depending on the extent of caudalization. A series of induction experiments have shown that caudalization is mediated by convergent extension: cell motility that is based on directed cell intercalation, and is essential for the morphogenesis of posterior axial tissues. During amphibian development, convergent extension is first expressed all-over the mesoderm and, after mesoderm involution, it becomes localized to the posterior mid-dorsal mesoderm, which produces notochord. This expression pattern of specific down regulation of convergent extension is also followed by the expression of the brachyury homolog. Furthermore, mouse brachyury has been implicated in the regulation of tissue elongation on the one hand, and in the control of posterior differentiation on the other. These observations suggest that protein encoded by the brachyury homolog controls the expression of convergent extension in the mesoderm. The idea is fully corroborated by a genetic study of mouse brachyury, which demonstrates that the gene product produces elongation of the posterior embryonic axis. However, there exists evidence for the induction of posterior dorsal mesodermal tissues, if brachyury homolog protein is expressed in the ectoderm. In both cases the brachyury homolog contributes to caudalization. A number of other genes appear to be involved in caudalization. The most important of these is pintavallis, which contains a fork-head DNA binding domain. It is first expressed in the marginal zone. After mesoderm involution, it is present not only in the presumptive notochord, but also in the floor plate. This is in contrast to the brachyury homolog, whose expression is restricted to mesoderm. The morphogenetic effects of exogenous RA on anteroposterior specification during amphibian embryogenesis are reviewed. The agent inhibits archencephalic differentiation and enhances differentiation of deuterencephalic and trunk levels. Thus the effect of exogenous RA on morphogenesis of CNS is very similar to that of caudalization, which is proposed to occur through the normal action of the organizer. According to a detailed analysis of the effect of lithium on morphogenesis induced by the Cynops organizer, lithium has a caudalizing effect closely comparable with that of RA. Furthermore, lithium induces convergent extension in the prechordal plate, which normally does not show cell motility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Skull base chordoma in infants is a very rare entity in spite of its congenital origin; only 11 clinical cases can be found in the literature so far. Here we report such a case and review the literature. The case is that of a 3.5-year old boy suffering from left abducent nerve palsy for 5 months. CT scan revealed an isodense mass lesion with bone destruction involving the clivus and left petrous apex, and was homogeneously enhanced on post-contrast study. MRI disclosed the clival tumor as a long T1 and long T2 mass. Angiogram showed no tumor stain. The tumor was preoperatively diagnosed as clival chordoma, and was partially removed via left transpetrosal-transtentorial approach. The tumor was found to extend into the subdural space through Dorrello's canal and compress the abducent nerve. Histological examination with H &amp; E, PAS, mucicarmine, and reticulin stainings led us to a diagnosis of "typical chordoma". Electron microscopy demonstrated the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum complexes (MERC), glycogen granules, and vacuoles in the tumor cells. Postoperative irradiation (total dose 55 Gy) was performed. At present, 30 months after the operation, no evidence of tumor regrowth nor hypothalamus-pituitary deficiency is recognizable and the patient is free from left abducent nerve palsy. It is concluded that skull base chordoma in infants should be postoperatively irradiated in an appropriate manner.</str>

This large tumor below the knee area infiltrated extensively the deep and superficial soft tissues but did not involve the bones. The tumor cells formed nodules resembling the architecture seen in chondroid tumors and chordoma. The tumor cells were often vacuolized, and there was extracellular myxoid matrix similar to that in chordoma or myxoid chondrosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry showed keratins 8 and 19, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin in most tumor cells, and there was also S-100 protein positivity in a number of tumor cells. Electron microscopy showed desmosomelike cell junctions and bundles of intermediate filaments resembling those seen in many epithelial neoplasms. Thus the tumor resembled chordoma in many respects.

      <str>The chick genes, cSox2 and cSox3, are members of a large family of genes that encode transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that these genes are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system during embryonic development. We show that cSox3 is expressed throughout the ectoderm that is competent to form nervous tissue before neural induction. The expression of cSox3 is lost from cells as they undergo gastrulation to form nonectodermal tissues; the transcription factor, Brachyury, appears in cells about to undergo gastrulation a short time before cSox3 transcripts are lost. Therefore, Brachyury expression may act functionally upstream of cSox3 downregulation. cSox3 expression is also lost from non-neuronal ectoderm shortly after the neural plate becomes morphologically apparent. cSox2 expression increases dramatically in the central nervous system as neural ectoderm is established. The appearance of cSox2 in neural ectoderm represents one of the earliest molecular responses to neural induction documented thus far.</str>

      <str>An immunocytochemical investigation has been carried out on five cases of chordoma (2 of the sacrum, 2 in the spheno-occipital bone and 1 in the parapharyngeal area) to study the expression of the 5 classes of intermediate filaments (IF): cytokeratin (CK), desmin (DES), GFAP, neurofilaments (NF) and vimentin (VIM). Our results show that constant coexpression of CK, NF and VIM does occur in chordomas, whereas DES and GFAP are not demonstrable in tumor cells. The three detected IF are invariably present in all cell types but not in intracellular vacuoles or in the extracellular mucoid substance. The pattern of immunoreactivity of chordomas appears very unique as very few other neoplasms demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of 3 distinct IF. Only choroid plexus tumors have been shown to manifest CK-NF-VIM immunoreactivity. The complex immunophenotype of chordomas may be related to their supposed origin from the notochord which normally undergoes conspicuous changes in location and morphology during embryonal development. Such changes might require the contemporary presence of multiple IF; IF expression, in fact, is known to be related to cell function and morphology. Notochordal cells and their neoplastic counterpart may consequently express an IF pattern which reflects unique architectural and morphological variations occurring during embryonal and tumor growth. Together with the speculative value of the detection of CK, NF and VIM in chordomas, the unusual immunocytochemical pattern of these tumors might provide useful diagnostic tool in differential diagnosis.</str>

      <str>Clival chordomas confront the surgeon with the task of resecting an aggressively invasive and destructive tumor in a critical surrounding. For many, mainly smaller, chordomas, the transnasal transclival approach is a feasible and safe surgical access. Larger tumors and especially those with extensive intradural, retrochiasmal, and/or deep cervical expansion are mostly approached by open craniotomy. Staged procedures are also commonly used in the case of expansive tumor growth. We present the first case of a single-session combined transnasal and transcranial approach to radically resect a large clival chordoma. </str>

A case of spinal chordoma in a child 4 years old, at the T12-L1 level, is reported. The tumor was surgically removed and a local radiotherapy was performed, but 9 months later spreading of lung metastases was observed. The unusual site along the vertebral column and the metastatic potential of this tumor are discussed. The very few cases reported in the literature were analyzed.</str>

      <str>Metastases in the breast are rare, with metastatic chordoma being one of the rarest. To our knowledge, only one such case has previously been published in the literature. We report a case of a 74-year-old woman who presented with a palpable lump in her right breast. The lump was mammographically suggestive of mucinous breast cancer because it was a solitary, small, circular, and moderately dense lesion yielding abundant mucoid aspirate. The tumor resembled mucinous carcinoma upon histologic and immunohistochemical examination: it had a mucinous stroma, and the tumor cells strongly expressed epithelial markers. However, the patient had previously undergone surgery for a recurrent sacral chordoma. In addition to the clinical history, the presence of typical physaliferous cells expressing neither estrogen receptors nor cytokeratin 7, but staining positively for S-100 protein, allowed the proper diagnosis. Although extremely rare, metastatic chordoma may represent a challenge in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions. Discriminating metastases of mucin-producing tumors in the breast from primary mucinous carcinomas is important with regard to the striking difference in prognosis of these lesions.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are uncommon skull base tumors, which are locally agressive and are usually not amenable to complete surgical resection. Proton beam irradiation, following surgery, is the preferred treatment modality. For diagnosis and determination of tumor site and extension, CT and MR imaging are the imaging modalities of choice. CT delineates bone destruction and the presence of calcifications and destroyed bone optimally. MR imaging is the modality of choice for better definition of the tumor margin from brain and other soft tissue structures (pharynx) and visualization of blood vessels. The signal intensities and enhancement pattern fail to differentiate chordoma from chondroid chordoma or chondrosarcoma. Chordomas arise from the clivus and therefore are located more centrally, whereas the majority of chondrosarcomas originate in the petroclival fissure and occur more laterally, although occasional overlap occurs in about one third of cases. Immunohistochemical methods allow differentiation of pure chordoma from chondroid chordoma and chondrosarcoma. Chordomas have a lower local control rate than chondrosarcomas.</str>

      <str>Seven cases of chordoma were studied immunohisto-chemically with antibodies directed to epithelium, nerve, mesenchyme, muscle and histiocyte. Six cases of chondrosarcoma and three cases of mucinous carcinoma of colon were studied as control. The results showed that the chordomas were positive for cyto-K 6/7, EMA 7/7, CEA 6/7, Vim 7/7, S-100 7/7, alpha-AT 7/7, Lyso 4/7, while negative for GFAP and Des in all 7 cases indicating that chordoma, just like notochord, had the potentiality of multidirectional differentiation. In contrast, none of the chondrosarcomas was positive for cyto-K, EMA or CEA, but positive for Vim and S-100 in 6 cases. Three cases of colon mucinous carcinoma were positive for epithelial antibodies, but none reacted with other antibodies. Thus, immunohistochemical studies are of help in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of chordoma.</str>

      <str>A case of clival chordoma without bone destruction is reported. A 28-year-old man was admitted to Kagoshima University Hospital on April 8, 1983 with the complaints of headache, displopia and gait disturbance. Neurological examination revealed the right eighth, ninth, tenth nerve palsy and gait disturbance. Plain skull firms showed no abnormality and left vertebral arteriography revealed a displacement of basilar artery to the left side. The CT scanning showed a low density area at the retroclival region, and enhancement was acquired slightly. Metrizamide cisternography, CT cisternography showed retroclival round tumor and no destruction of the bone. The tumor which invaded intradurally was removed totally. Histological examination confilmed the chordoma. In this report, it will be stressed that when clival chordoma invades intradually, subtemporal approach will be most favorable, and metrizamide CT cisternography is one of the useful diagnostic procedures of retroclival mass.</str>

      <str>The authors describe a rare case of giant ecchordosis physaliphora (EP) in a 16-year-old female patient who presented with diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with Gd contrast revealed a 3.0 × 1.7 × 1.8-cm nonenhancing, extraaxial epidural mass along the dorsal aspect of the clivus that was T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense with intermediate signal on diffusion sequences. Resection via a transnasal transsphenoidal approach to the ventral clival wall resulted in a stable tumor size with no evidence of interval growth after 30 months. Although this case features a strictly extradural EP, this tumor more commonly occurs in the subdural space and requires differentiation from intradural chordoma. Unlike EP, intradural chordoma may enhance with Gd contrast, is more likely to be associated with cranial nerve palsies and brainstem symptoms, and will occasionally have an elevated MIB-1 index. In this paper the authors highlight the different possible midline locations for both EP and chordoma, the difficulty in distinguishing between intradural giant EP and intradural chordoma, and the potential occurrence of these lesions in young people despite their typically slow rate of growth, while also underscoring the need for further investigation into the tumors' cytogenetic behavior. </str>

      <str>The objective of this was to summarize the efficacy and safety of iodine-125 seed implantation in the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma. CT-guided implantation of radioactive iodine-125 seed was applied in treating a patient with sacrococcygeal chordoma. The incidence of complications was recorded and the results were evaluated and analyzed, to compare the postoperative complications and recurrence rate of sacrococcygeal chordoma. The patient was followed up to 15 months after operation. The minimum peripheral dose was 180 Gy, and 8 months after the implantation, the tumor mass was reduced significantly. There was no serious complications detected during the follow-up period. Radioactive iodine-125 seed implantation can improve the target volume dose, with the high doses of radioactive iodine-125 seed, the tumor, which was refractory and insensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can be effectively controlled and complications are less than surgical treatment. However, the long-term efficacy of this treatment needs further follow-up.</str>

      <str>The authors report the case of a chordoma developed exclusively in the epidural space at the L1-L2 level in a 6 year old child. The tumor was easily removed in toto. No post-operative radiotherapy was given. The diagnosis of chordoma was based on the histological characteristics of the lesion and the results of immunohistological studies which were both typical of this lesion. This observation is exceptional because of the young age of the patient, the lumbar level of the tumor and, even more, the absence of any bone involvement. The 8 previously published cases of chordoma developed along the craniospinal axis but without bone involvement are reviewed and analysed: all were subdural; 7 were intracranial (6 prepontic, 1 suprasellar): only one was intraspinal. These lesions raise the problem of their diagnosis, of their treatment and of their embryogenesis. They could develop from ectopic notochordal remnants: the "ecchondrosis physaliphura".</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a distinct malignant neoplasm arising from the remnants of the notochord and occurring mostly in the fifth or sixth decade of life, and occupying most frequently the sacral area (Bibbo, Comprehensive Cytopathology 1997; p 534). Metastases of the neoplasm may occur in 10-40% of cases (Jenkins et al., Clin. Radiol. 1995;50:416-417). Because of its rarity, the diagnosis of chordoma may be difficult to render, especially on fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). However, a clear-cut distinction of chordoma from other neoplasms is of utmost importance, since the prognosis and treatment of the patient will depend on the final diagnosis. This distinction in the case of metastases can be made easily, where correlation of previous histology has been done and/or ancillary studies have been performed. Diagn.

      <str>Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors that originate in the primitive notochord. The most frequent location is the sacrococcygeal region. It is more frequent in males. Average age is 61 years old. The aim of this study is to report a case of externalization of a chordoma in the sacral region.</str>
      <str>We present the case of a 62-year-old female whose disease began 4 years before admission, reporting discomfort in the sacral region. In the intergluteal area, the presence of a mass that increased in size during the previous year was noticed and palpated. On proctological examination, a tumor of 6 cm in diameter is found located in the midsacral region 3 cm from the anal canal. On palpation, the tumor is hard and painless with a regular and mobile surface. X-ray of the coccyx was normal. Surgery was performed with total excision and primary closure. Histopathological report was chordoma.</str>
      <str>Theoretically, notochord in the vertebral bodies is not completely degenerative and the remaining tissue persists, producing chordomas. The most common symptom is local pain. Diagnosis is made by imaging: x-ray of lumbosacral spine, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment of choice is wide surgical resection.</str>
      <str>Diagnosis of chordoma is rare but should be kept in mind in patients with pain in lower back or coccyx and, even more so, if accompanied by a mass with years of evolution.</str>

      <str>We report the characterisation of a Brachyury ortholog (PvuBra) in the marine gastropod Patella vulgata. In this mollusc, the embryo displays an equal cleavage pattern until the 32-cell stage. There, an inductive event takes place that sets up the bilateral symmetry, by specifying one of the four initially equipotent vegetal macromeres as the posterior pole of all subsequent morphogenesis. This macromere, usually designated as 3D, will subsequently act as an organiser. We show that 3D expresses PvuBra as soon as its fate is determined. As reported for another mollusc (J. D. Lambert and L. M. Nagy (2001) Development 128, 45-56), we found that 3D determination and activity also involve the activation of the MAP kinase ERK, and we further show that PvuBra expression in 3D requires ERK activity. PvuBra expression then rapidly spreads to neighbouring cells that cleave in a bilateral fashion and whose progeny will constitute the posterior edge of the blastopore during gastrulation, suggesting a role for PvuBra in regulating cell movements and cleavage morphology in Patella. Until the completion of gastrulation, PvuBra expression is maintained at the posterior pole, and along the developing anterior-posterior axis. Comparing this expression pattern with what is known in other Bilateria, we advocate that Brachyury might have a conserved role in the regulation of anterior-posterior patterning among Bilateria, through the maintenance of a posterior growth zone, suggesting that a teloblastic mode of axis formation might be ancestral to the Bilateria.</str>

      <str>The mouse Brachyury gene (T) is required in notochord differentiation and posterior mesoderm formation during axial development. We have isolated the chick homologue of T(Ch-T) and determined its putative protein sequence and expression pattern during embryogenesis. Ch-T is expressed in the epiblast close to and within the primitive streak, in early migrating mesoderm and in the notochord. In later stages Ch-T expression is found in the tail bud and in the entire notochord. The notochord expression ceases in an anterior-posterior wave when the formation of the body anlage is completed. This pattern is consistent with those reported for the expression of the mouse T gene and the T homologues of Xenopus laevis and zebrafish, suggesting that the mechanisms of embryonic pattern formation are highly conserved in all vertebrates. The N-terminal half of Ch-T shows a very high degree of sequence identity with the corresponding region of mouse T which has DNA-binding activity, and with the N-terminal half of Xenopus (Xbra) and zebrafish (Ntl) T protein. Finally, we have analyzed the effects of activin A on Ch-T induction and axis formation. Localized activin A treatment of prestreak blastoderms results in ectopic Ch-T expression that correlates with formation of second primitive streaks or with repositioning of the site of single streak origin (Cooke et al., 1994). These results strengthen the previous evidence that Brachyury activation is an early response to axis-inducing signals in vivo.</str>

      <str>A detailed immunohistochemical characterization of different cytokeratin subclasses was performed on frozen tumour tissue from three classical chordomas. Simple epithelium cytokeratins Nos 8, 18, and 19 were detected in all tumour cells while cytokeratin No. 7 was not found. Cytokeratins characteristic of squamous differentiation, including keratinization, were generally lacking, with the exception of the varying expression of cytokeratin No. 4. Vimentin was found in all the tumours, while they lacked desmin immunoreactivity. The present study indicates the co-expression of vimentin and cytokeratins, predominantly of the simple epithelium type. In addition, chordoma cells have the ability to express cytokeratins characteristic of squamous differentiation. This finding corresponds well to the electron microscopic findings of tonofilament bundles ending in well-developed desmosomes.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cells maintained on human amniotic epithelial cells (hESCs(hAEC)) are better preserved in an undifferentiated state and express pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 at higher levels compared with growth on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (hESCs(MEF)). Here we report that this correlates with the absence of the tumor suppressor and metabolic balancer gene, LKB1 expression in hESCs(hAEC). RNA interference knockdown of LKB1 in hESCs(MEF) resulted in upregulation of pluripotency marker genes of Oct4 and Nanog, while downregulation of differentiation markers (Runx1, AFP, GATA, Brachyury, Sox17 and Nestin). As in somatic cells, LKB1 controls p21/WAF1 expression by promoter binding in hESCs(MEF). Our results suggested that the absence of LKB1-mediated signaling is an important determinant of feeder cell-mediated support of hESC renewal.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors that arise from the remnants of the notochord. Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordoma is a challenge. The authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordoma and 10 patients with chondrosarcoma.</str>
      <str>Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%, respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordoma) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam radiotherapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with worst RFS rates as compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy, followed by CSF leakages were the most frequent postoperative complication. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients.</str>
      <str>A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and the patient's age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma.

      <str>A retrospective analysis of chordoma in the spine was performed by survival analysis. Local relapse-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed from the date of surgery to the date of local recurrence and death. The LRFS and OS rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method to identify potential prognostic factors. Factors with P values ≤ .1 were subjected to multivariate analysis by Cox regression analysis. P values ≤ .05 were considered statistically significant.</str>
      <str>A total of 153 patients with spinal chordoma were included in the study. The mean follow-up period was 72.0 months (range, 1-279 months). Local recurrence was detected in 51 cases after initial surgery in our center, while death occurred in 42 cases. The statistical analysis suggested that tumor location of C3-L5, dedifferentiated chordoma, preoperative Frankel scores A-C, and total spondylectomy were independent prognostic factors for LRFS. In addition, total en bloc spondylectomy and Karnofsky' performance status (KPS) ≥ 80% were favorable factors for OS.</str>
      <str>Total spondylectomy, by either en bloc or piecemeal method, could significantly reduce LRFS for spinal chordoma. Location of C3-L5 is a favorable factor for LRFS, while dedifferentiated subtype and preoperative Frankel scores A-C are adverse prognostic factors.

      <str>The Brachyury, or T, gene is required for notochord development in animals occupying all three chordate subphyla and probably also had this role in the last common ancestor of the chordate lineages. In two chordate subphyla (vertebrates and cephalochordates), T is also expressed during gastrulation in involuting endodermal and mesodermal cells, and in vertebrates at least, this expression domain is required for proper development. In the basally diverging chordate subphylum Urochordata, animals in the class Ascidiacea do not employ T during gastrulation in endodermal or nonaxial mesodermal cells, and it has been suggested that nonnotochordal roles for T were acquired in the cephalochordate-vertebrate lineage after it split with Urochordata. To test this hypothesis, we cloned T from Oikopleura dioica, a member of the urochordate class Appendicularia (or Larvacea), which diverged basally in the subphylum. Investigation of the expression pattern in developing Oikopleura embryos showed early expression in presumptive notochord precursor cells, in the notochord, and in parts of the developing gut and cells of the endodermal strand. We conclude that the ancestral role of T likely included expression in the developing gut and became necessary in chordates for construction of the notochord.</str>

Point mutations that reduce the binding of a GST/Ci-Su(H) fusion protein in vitro diminish the expression of mutagenized Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in electroporated embryos. Overexpression of a Ci-Su(H) fusion protein containing the Drosophila Hairy repression domain interferes with notochord differentiation, producing mutant tadpoles with shortened tails. Expression of a constitutively activated Xotch receptor in the notochord, endoderm, and CNS also alters tail morphogenesis.

Diagnosis has been greatly improved by MRI and immunohistochemistry. Conversely, complementary immunohistochemistry, cytometry and cytogenetic techniques have failed to improve prognosis evaluation. Radical surgery with free surgical margins is the most accurate curative treatment. Progress in radiotherapy should offer new therapeutic perspectives in the future. The recognition of new entities such as giant notochordal rest or hamartoma, and notochordal cells benign tumor, can lead to confusion since there is no consensus regarding their nature and whether or not they correspond to chordoma precursors.

Seven of the eight patients currently have local control of their tumor; however, follow-up time is too short to judge the long-term local control rate of this treatment technique.</str>

Effective management of primary bone tumors hinges on the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of physicians with expertise in this area, both in the realms of diagnosis and treatment. In her presentation at the NCCN 18th Annual Conference, Dr. J. Sybil Biermann reviewed the changes to the 2013 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for bone cancer, featuring the introduction of new sections on giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) and chordoma.

The major cell type was a small, isolated, hyperchromatic cell with sharply defined nuclear membrane and granular cytoplasm. However, the characteristic cell of this neoplasm, the so-called physaliferous cell with typical bubbly cytoplasm, was also noted. Cytologic findings were compared to biopsy findings, with a good correlation of tumor morphology. Clinical follow-up revealed unusually aggressive tumor behavior, and the patient died a year later despite intensive chemotherapy. The differential diagnosis of the condition is also discussed.</str>

      <str>A homologue of the T-box gene, Brachyury, has been isolated from hydra. The gene, termed HyBra1, is expressed in the endoderm and is associated with the formation of the hypostome, the apical part of the head in four different developmental situations. In adults, which are continuously undergoing patterning, HyBra1 is continuously expressed in the hypostome. During budding, hydra's asexual form of reproduction, the gene is expressed in a small area that will eventually form the hypostome of the developing bud before any morphological sign of budding is apparent. The gene is also expressed very early during head regeneration and is confined to the region that will form the hypostome. During embryogenesis, HyBra1 is expressed shortly before hatching in the region that will form the apical end of the animal, the hypostome. The absence of expression at the apical end of decapitated animals of reg-16, a head formation-deficient mutant, provides additional evidence for a role of HyBra1 during head formation. Further, treatments that alter the head activation gradient have no effect on HyBra1 expression indicating the role of the gene is confined to head formation. Transplantation experiments indicate that the expression occurs before head determination has occurred, but expression does not irreversibly commit tissue to forming a head. A comparison of the function of the Brachyury homologues suggests an evolutionary conservation of a molecular mechanism that has been co-opted for a number of developmental processes throughout evolution.</str>

      <str>Due to the presence of a blastopore as in amphibians, the turtle has been suggested to exemplify a transition form from an amphibian- to an avian-type gastrulation pattern. In order to test this hypothesis and gain insight into the emergence of the unique characteristics of amniotes during gastrulation, we have performed the first molecular characterization of the gastrula in a reptile, the turtle Emys orbicularis. The study of Brachyury, Lim1, Otx2 and Otx5 expression patterns points to a highly conserved dynamic of expression with amniote model organisms and makes it possible to identify the site of mesoderm internalization, which is a long-standing issue in reptiles. Analysis of Brachyury expression also highlights the presence of two distinct phases, less easily recognizable in model organisms and respectively characterized by an early ring-shaped and a later bilateral symmetrical territory. Systematic comparisons with tetrapod model organisms lead to new insights into the relationships of the blastopore/blastoporal plate system shared by all reptiles, with the blastopore of amphibians and the primitive streak of birds and mammals. The biphasic Brachyury expression pattern is also consistent with recent models of emergence of bilateral symmetry, which raises the question of its evolutionary significance.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is the founder member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which is characterized by a DNA-binding domain of approximately 200 amino acids. Members of the T-box gene family play important roles in the development of both vertebrate and invertebrate embryos, including the control of gastrulation, development of the heart, and perhaps even the decision as to whether to form arm or leg. An understanding of how the T-box genes act requires analysis of how their expression is controlled, identification of their target genes, and an insight into how different family members exert different effects.</str>

      <str>Complete excision of sacrococcygeal chordoma is necessary at initial surgery due to its poor sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, due to the anatomic characteristics of this tumor, intralesional excision tends to be employed, resulting in local recurrences in many patients.</str>
      <str>The clinical features and results of surgical treatment of 13 patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma who were treated at the Chiba Cancer Center and Chiba University beginning in 1972 were analyzed.</str>
      <str>Intralesional excision was performed in eight patients, marginal excision in two patients, and wide excision in three patients. Local recurrence was observed in six patients, with a high proportion occurring in the gluteal muscles attached to the sacrum (the gluteus maximus muscle and piriform muscle). Seven patients died of their disease and six patients were alive with no evidence of disease. The 5-year survival rate was 81.8% and the 10-year survival rate was 29.1%.</str>
      <str>It is highly possible that residual chordoma infiltrating the gluteal muscles accounts mainly for the local recurrences. Therefore, a precise preoperative assessment of the tumor infiltration into the gluteal muscles by magnetic resonance imaging is important for the prevention of local recurrence. For complete tumor removal, a radical wide posterior surgical margin of the gluteal muscles should be employed. A less radical anterior surgical margin is sufficient because there is a firm presacral fascia anterior to the sacrum. The appropriate surgical margin for the complete removal of the chordoma differs according to the location of the tumor and tissues involved.</str>

      <str>We report the findings from an aspiration biopsy and resection of a chordoma-like tumorous mass in the wall of the thorax of a 36-yr-old man with immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and cytogenetic studies. The 4-cm oval tumor was an incidental finding on physical examination, and no other lesions were identified after comprehensive radiologic studies. The aspirate was composed of sheets and nests of cells with distinct borders in a myxoid and fibrillary extracellular matrix. The neoplastic cells were uniform and round or polygonal with abundant pale blue vacuolated cytoplasm and small round, central or eccentric nuclei. On electron microscopy, mitochondrial rough endoplasmic reticulum complexes were seen in neoplastic cells. These features were similar to those of a conventional chordoma. However, the cytogenetic pattern, 43, XY ,-1, -2, der (5)t(1p;5q), -6, add(8p) ,add(10q), was not typical. In addition, the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, S-100, AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, and CK 19; were focally positive for EMA and smooth muscle actin; and were negative for cytokeratin 1 and 10 (34 beta E12), CK 7, CK 8 (35H 11B), CK 17, and CK 20. The cytogenetic and immunohistochemical patterns were different from conventional chordoma and its peripheral counterpart, chordoma periphericum, suggesting the diagnosis of parachordoma.

      <str>Gastrulation in the marsupial frog Gastrotheca riobambae has been analyzed by the distribution of the Brachyury (T) protein. Comparison with other amphibians provides mechanistic insights, since G. riobambae develops slowly and has the most divergent mode of amphibian gastrulation, producing an embryonic disk. The T pattern indicates that the prospective mesoderm is superficial, as in many amphibians. The dorsal blastopore lip could not be identified by the expression of T, or by morphological criteria, thus it is unknown whether Gastrotheca embryos have a dorsal organizer before or after blastopore closure. The circumblastoporal and notochordal expression of T, which are temporally contiguous in Xenopus, are separated in Gastrotheca, implying that distinct regulatory mechanisms may control the expression of T in its two domains. The separation of the T pattern also indicates that involution at the blastopore is separate from notochord formation. In addition, extension of the archenteron and notochord occurs after blastopore closure, suggesting that dorsal convergence and extension have been delayed until after blastopore closure. Therefore, dorsal convergence and extension need not be the cause of blastopore closure in Gastrotheca. The separation of gastrulation events in embryos that have not been experimentally manipulated, such as those of Gastrotheca, helps in understanding the distinct nature of gastrulation processes.</str>

To this end, we have identified and characterized a novel murine and human gene encoding a putative transcription factor related to the Brachyury (T) gene that is expressed only in postmitotic cells. T-brain-1 (Tbr-1) mRNA is largely restricted to the cerebral cortex, where during embryogenesis it distinguishes domains that we propose may give rise to paleocortex, limbic cortex, and neocortex. Tbr-1 and Id-2 expression in the neocortex have discontinuities that define molecularly distinct neocortical areas. Tbr-1 expression is analyzed in the context of the prosomeric model. Topological maps are proposed for the organization of the dorsal telencephalon.</str>

      <str>The notochord is a defining character of the chordates, and the T-box transcription factor Brachyury has been shown to be required for notochord development in all chordates examined. In the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, at least 44 notochord genes have been identified as bona fide transcriptional targets of Brachyury. We examined the embryonic expression of a subset of murine orthologs of Ciona Brachyury target genes in the notochord to assess its conservation throughout chordate evolution. We focused on analyzing the Leprecan gene family, which in mouse is composed of three genes, as opposed to the single-copy Ciona gene. We found that all three mouse Leprecan genes are expressed in the notochord. Additionally, while Leprecan expression in C. intestinalis is confined to the notochord, expression of its mouse orthologs includes dorsal root ganglia, limb buds, branchial arches, and developing kidneys. These results have interesting implications for the evolution and development of chordates.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare type of malignant bone tumor and is known to arise from the remnants of the notochord. Resistance to chemotherapy makes the treatment of chordoma difficult; therefore, new approaches need to be developed to cure this disease. Differentiation therapy, using various differentiating agents, is attracting oncologists as a common therapeutic method to treat other tumors. Based on forcing cells to mature into other lineages, differentiation therapy might be an available method to treat chordomas in addition to conventional therapies.</str>
      <str>In this study a chordoma cell line, U-CH1, was exposed to several chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide, fludarabine, methotrexate, nilotinib, and imatinib mesylate under appropriate conditions. The first group of U-CH1 cells was exposed to drugs only and the second group of cells was exposed to the simultaneous treatment of 1 μM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapeutic agents in differentiation therapy. The efficacy of the differentiation method was assessed by measuring the viability of U-CH1 cells.</str>
      <str>Vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, and fludarabine, each at a concentration of 10 μM, decreased the number of chordoma cells when given alone down to 11%, 0%, 30%, 67%, and 3%, respectively. Etoposide and cisplatin, each at a concentration of 10 μM, reduced the percentage of viable chordoma cells in a more effective way when given with 1 μM ATRA simultaneously, reducing the number of viable cells to 14% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, imatinib and nilotinib, each at a concentration of 3 μM, as well as 10 μM methotrexate, showed no decrease in the number of cancer cells.</str>
      <str>The results suggest that chordoma cells may be treated using the differentiation method in a more effective way than when they are treated with chemotherapeutic agents alone. This new approach may be an alternative method to conventional therapies in the treatment of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Trichoplax adhaerens is the only species known from the phylum Placozoa with one of the simplest metazoan body plans. In the small disc-like organism an upper and a lower epithelium can be distinguished with a less compact third cell layer in between. When Trichoplax was first described in 1883, the relation of these three cell layers with ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm of higher animals was discussed. Still, little is known about embryonic development of Trichoplax, however, genes thought to be specific for mesoderm in bilaterian animals turned out to be already present in non-bilaterians. Searching for a Brachyury homologue, two members of the T-box gene family were isolated from Trichoplax, Brachyury and a Tbx2/3 homologue. The T-box genes encode a transcription factor family characterized by the DNA-binding T-box domain. T-box genes have been found in all metazoans so far investigated, but in contrast to other transcription factors such as the homeobox family, T-box genes are not present in plants or fungi. The distinct expression patterns of two T-box genes in Trichoplax point to non-redundant functions already present at the beginning of animal evolution. Since the expression patterns derived by in situ hybridization do not overlap with anatomical structures, it can be concluded that this simple animal has more than the four cell types described in the literature. This hidden complexity and the unresolved position in relation to Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora and Bilateria highlight the necessity of the inclusion of Trichoplax in studies of comparative evolutionary and developmental biology.</str>

      <str>We have previously isolated a cDNA clone coding for Xenopus AP-2rep (activator protein-2 repressor), a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, and reported its expression pattern in developing Xenopus embryos. In the present study, the physiological function of AP-2rep in the morphogenetic movements of the dorsal mesoderm and ectoderm was investigated. Embryos injected with either AP-2rep or VP16repC (a dominant-negative mutant) into the dorsal marginal zone at the 4-cell stage exhibited abnormal morphology in dorsal structures. Both AP-2rep and VP16repC also inhibited the elongation of animal cap explants treated with activin without affecting the expression of differentiation markers. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that expression of brachyury and Wnt11 was greatly suppressed by injection of VP16repC or AP-2rep morpholino, but expression was restored by the simultaneous injection of wild-type AP-2rep RNA. Furthermore, the morphogenetic abnormality induced by injection of VP16repC or AP-2rep morpholino was restored by simultaneous injection of brachyury or Wnt11 mRNA. These results show that AP-2rep is involved in the morphogenesis of the mesoderm at the gastrula stage, via the brachyury and/or Wnt pathways.</str>

      <str>In order to gain insights into the evolution of gastrulation mechanisms among vertebrates, we have characterized a Brachyury-related gene in a lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis, and in a chondrichthyan, Scyliorhinus canicula. These two genes, respectively termed LfT and ScT, share with their osteichthyan counterparts prominent expression sites in the developing notochord, the tailbud, but also a transient expression in the prechordal plate, which is likely to be ancestral among vertebrates. In addition, the lamprey LfT gene is transcribed in the endoderm of the pharyngeal arches and the epiphysis, two expression sites that have not been reported thus far in gnathostomes, and, as in the chick, in the differentiating nephrotomes. Since Brachyury expression in nascent mesoderm and endoderm is highly conserved among vertebrates as well as cephalochordates, we have used this marker to identify these cell populations during gastrulation in the dogfish. The results suggest that these cells are initially present over the whole margin of the blastoderm and are displaced during gastrulation to its posterior part, which may correspond to the site of mesoderm and endoderm internalization. These data provide the first molecular characterization of gastrulation in a chondrichthyan. They indicate that gastrulation in the dogfish and in some amniotes shares striking similarities despite the phylogenetic distance between these species. This supports the hypothesis that the extensively divergent morphologies of gastrulae among vertebrates largely result from adaptations to the presence of yolk.</str>

The neoplastic cells were embedded in an abundant extracellular substance staining metachromatically with Diff-Quik™. Both neoplasms had a typical clinical and instrumental presentation (primary sacrococcygeal tumor in a 58-year-old man and primary soft tissue mass of the hand palm and wrist in a 31-year-old man). The cytopathological findings in both the neoplasms were so similar as to be almost indistinguishable, and this similarity included the immunocytochemical findings.

      <str>Sacral chordomas constitute more than half of all chordomas and have a slower local growth than other bone malignant tumors. Although complete radical resection produces a longer local control and disease-free survival at the initial visit, chordomas are already often too large for complete resection to be possible. Particle radiotherapy consisting of proton and carbon-ion is a promising new modality which has an inherent anti-tumor effect against many types of malignancies. However, the application of particle radiotherapy for tumors adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract like sacral chordoma is restricted because the tolerance dose of the intestine is extremely low. A novel two-step treatment was developed with surgical spacer placement and subsequent proton radiotherapy to administer particle radiotherapy with curative intent. This report presents a case of a patient with a huge sacral chordoma treated by this method. This new strategy may potentially be an innovative and standard therapy for unresectable sacral chordoma in the near future.</str>

      <str>Malignant bone tumors require wide resection. Wide resection by total en bloc spondylectomy is difficult or not feasible for malignant vertebral tumors of the cervical spine due to the peculiar anatomic complexity of this region, including the vertebral arteries and the neural structures.

      <str>Intracranial chordoma is a locally aggressive and relatively rare tumor of the skull base that is thought to originate from embryonic remnants of the primitive notochord. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are usually required for evaluation of intracranial chordomas due to bone involvement and the proximity of these tumors to many critical soft-tissue structures. At CT, intracranial chordoma typically appears as a centrally located, well-circumscribed, expansile soft-tissue mass that arises from the clivus with associated extensive lytic bone destruction. However, MR imaging is the single best imaging modality for both pre- and posttreatment evaluation of intracranial chordoma. On T1-weighted MR images, intracranial chordomas demonstrate intermediate to low signal intensity and are easily recognized within the high-signal-intensity fat of the clivus. On T2-weighted MR images, they characteristically demonstrate very high signal intensity, a finding that likely reflects the high fluid content of vacuolated cellular components. Moderate to marked enhancement is common and often heterogeneous on contrast material-enhanced images. Combination treatment with radical surgical resection and proton beam radiation therapy achieves the best results.</str>

      <str>The clinical data of 79 patients with skull base chordoma, with a male/female ratio of 1.3:1, who received operations in Tiantan Hospital between May 1993 and June 2005 were selected. Thirteen factors, including gender, age, main symptoms, positive signs, bulk of the tumor, having received operation or radiotherapy before admission, grouping and staging of the tumor's location, and texture, adherence, pathological and resection grouping of the lesion, underwent Kaplan-Meier single factor analysis, Cox regression, and t-test.</str>

      <str>At the conclusion of this presentation, the participants should be able to recognize seeding as a form of treatment failure in transseptal resection of clival chordomas.</str>

      <str>Case report and literature review.</str>
      <str>The clinical history, radiologic imaging, and pathology of a single patient are reviewed.</str>
      <str>A 35-year-old female presented with a left intranasal mass that completely occluded the left nasal passage. The patient had a history of clival chordoma treated at an outside institution with multiple partial resections via a transseptal approach and postoperative Gamma Knife radiotherapy. A 2.5 cm mass in the left nasal cavity as well as a 4 cm sellar mass was identified on MRI. Biopsy of the left nasal mass confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma, which was presumed to be secondary to seeding from a previous resection attempt. The patient received no further treatment due to multiple comorbidities.</str>
      <str>Recurrence of clival chordoma due to seeding along the surgical pathway is an infrequent mechanism of treatment failure, with only rare cases documented in the literature. When deciding on the appropriate surgical approach, the surgeon must consider the risk of septal seeding during a transseptal approach. The emergence of transnasal endoscopic skull base approaches may reduce the likelihood of surgical pathway tumor seeding.</str>

      <str>We report a lesion of the mobile spine in a 77-yr-old white male who presented with lower back pain, radiating bilaterally to the legs, with numbness on walking and standing. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large mass within L3-L4 vertebral bodies; however, chordoma was not suspected or suggested. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the mass revealed mostly blood with isolated flat clusters of polygonal rounded epithelial-like cells in a myxoid background. Immunohistochemistry could not be performed on the FNAB specimen due to inadequate material for cell-block. A limited immunocytochemistry panel was performed on one cytology smear. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin. During primary and expert evaluation, these features were interpreted as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Prostate and thyroid were suggested as possible primary sites. An extensive clinical and radiological search did not reveal a primary lesion. Four years later, the patient underwent surgical decompression and stabilization of his lumbar spine to avoid a catastrophic collapse of spine with neurological deficit. Histomorphological features and immunohistochemical studies at this time confirmed the lesion as chordoma. This case highlights the significance of considering chordoma in the differential diagnosis of FNAB cytology of spinal column lesions suggestive of adenocarcinoma, especially when the clusters of low-grade epithelioid cells with vacuolated cytoplasm in a myxoid background do not show epithelial structures such as papillae, glands, or acini.</str>

The mean age was 3.4 years, and, in the cases for which sex was known, females (n = 10) outnumbered males (n = 5) two to one. All 20 tumors occurred on the tip of the tail. Nineteen of 20 tumors (95%) were composed of three tissue components, often arranged concentrically with lobules of physaliferous cells at the periphery, trabecular bone in the center, and cartilage in between. The bone often contained marrow and hematopoietic cells. One tumor lacked chondromatous or osseous tissue. Immunohistochemical results were consistent with previous studies of chordoma. All 20 tumors (100%) were positive for keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments; 15 (75%) were positive for S-100 protein; and 17 (85%) were positive for neuron specific enolase. This neoplasm shares morphologic and immunohistochemical features with "classic," as well as chondroid chordoma, of human beings, making it a potential animal model.</str>

      <str>We describe a sacral chordoma composed of solid nests of epithelioid cells. The tumor originated in the presacral area. Extensive clinical workup did not reveal any other lesion in the patient. In contrast to typical chordomas, this tumor contained only rare physaliferous cells, had no myxoid stroma, and was immunohistochemically unreactive with the antibody to S-100. The diagnosis of chordoma was supported by electron microscopy, which showed that the tumor cells contained numerous mitochondria surrounded by profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The abundance of mitochondria, the narrow intercellular spaces, combined with a lack of glycogen, and a lack of extracellular myxoid material accounted for the epithelioid appearance of the tumor. We report this case to point out that the cellular chordomas can appear epithelioid in the sacrum and they may resemble metastatic squamous or transitional cell carcinomas.</str>

      <str>A 49-year-old man, with a tumor shadow overlapping the heart on chest X-ray film was followed for 5 years. He was admitted because the tumor shadow enlarged. Chest CT scan showed a 6 x 7 cm in diameter extrapulmonary tumor at the Th8 and Th9 level, and a defect of the anterior margin of the thoracic vertebra is observed. Because thoracic CT-guided needle biopsy was not successful, total resection combined with thoracic vertebrae was performed. The tumor was under the parietal pleura and did not involve into the intrathoracic organs. Histological examination showed small round cells arranged in sheets and cord-like fashion in a mucinous stroma. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein, vimentin, AE1/3. CAM5.2, EMA and Alcian blue staining. Thus, we confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma. Chordoma is a rare malignant bone tumor that originates from notochordal remnants and accounts for about 1-4% of all malignant bone tumors. Intrathoracic mediastinal chordomas is extremely rare, representing only 3% of all chordomas.</str>

      <str>A 37-year-old man presented with right facial pain and a nonpalpable mass over the malar eminence. An incisional biopsy via the intraoral route was performed and interpreted as a vascular malformation with degenerative changes. His symptoms persisted, and a repeat biopsy was suggestive of an epithelioid nerve sheath tumor. Total resection of the tumor was planned to include the infraorbital and malar regions, the infratemporal fossa, and the pterygopalatine fossa. At surgery, the tumor was removed with tumor-free margins obtained along the course of the maxillary nerve just before its entrance into the cavernous sinus. The pathological findings and the immunohistochemistry demonstrated a typical chordoma with no chondroid or sarcomatous dedifferentiation. We think that with greater use of immunohistochemical markers and electron microscopy, patients with chordoma in this location may be diagnosed promptly and accurately.</str>

      <str>A clinicopathologic study of 25 cases of chordoma revealed that this tumor occurs principally in (68%), with a predominance for the sixth decade of life (seven patients--28%), and shows a predilection for the sacrococcygeal region (52%). The symptomatology was intimately related to the location of the tumor. Histologically, chordoma showed an extremely wide range in its cellular composition and pattern, not only from tumor to tumor, but also often in different portions of the same tumor. In addition to the large physaliferous cells in a lobular arrangement, large cells with apparently degenerating nuclei (ghost cells) were commonly seen; cells arranged in concentric spherical formations were observed in two cases, whereas small, round cells predominated in another case. A sarcomatous pattern was prominent in two cases. Large pink cells were frequently seen and in one case were arranged in epithelial-like columns. Whether these neoplastic components can be related to different degrees of tumor differentiation is difficult to establish. Histologic features of five cases in which metastasis occurred were compared to previously described metastasizing cases. These appear to be few reliable features helpful in suggesting the metastatic potential of this neoplasm.</str>

Both MO and HypNA-pPNAs against a tumor suppressor gene induced comparable upregulation of p53, illustrating similar effects on transcription profiles. HypNA-pPNAs are therefore a valuable alternative for reverse genetic studies, enabling the targeting of previously inaccessible genes in zebrafish or validating newly identified orthologs, and perhaps for reverse genetic studies in other organisms.</str>

      <str>Most bilaterian animals possess a through gut with a separate mouth and anus. It is commonly believed that during the transition from radial to bilateral symmetry, both openings evolved simultaneously by the lateral closure of a slit-like blastopore. Molecular phylogenies however, place the acoel flatworms, which have only one opening to their digestive system, as the sister group to all remaining Bilateria. To address how this single body opening is related to the mouth and anus of the protostomes and deuterostomes, we studied the expression of genes involved in bilaterian foregut and hindgut patterning during the development of the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura. Here we show that the genes brachyury and goosecoid are expressed in association with the acoel mouth, suggesting that this single opening is homologous to the mouth of other bilaterians. In addition, we find that the genes caudal, orthopedia and brachyury-which are expressed in various bilaterian hindguts-are expressed in a small region at the posterior end of the animal, separated from the anterior oral brachyury-expressing region by a dorsal domain of ectodermal bmp2/4 expression. These results contradict the hypothesis that the bilaterian mouth and anus evolved simultaneously from a common blastoporal opening, and suggest that a through gut might have evolved independently in different animal lineages.</str>

      <str>We studied the role of Wnt signaling in axis formation during metamorphosis and regeneration in the cnidarian Hydractinia. Activation of Wnt downstream events during metamorphosis resulted in a complete oralization of the animals and repression of aboral structures (i.e. stolons). The expression of Wnt3, Tcf and Brachyury was upregulated and became ubiquitous. Rescue experiments using Tcf RNAi resulted in normal metamorphosis and quantitatively normal Wnt3 and Brachyury expression. Isolated, decapitated polyps regenerated only heads but no stolons. Activation of Wnt downstream targets in regenerating animals resulted in oralization of the polyps. Knocking down Tcf or Wnt3 by RNAi inhibited head regeneration and resulted in complex phenotypes that included ectopic aboral structures. Multiple heads then grew when the RNAi effect had dissipated. Our results provide functional evidence that Wnt promotes head formation but represses the formation of stolons, whereas downregulation of Wnt promotes stolons and represses head formation.</str>

Developmental RT-PCR analysis showed that Ttu-Bra transcripts are present in embryos at stages 9-11, 16 and 17, but undetectable at the remaining embryonic stages. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that Ttu-Bra is expressed transiently in the third quartette of micromeres, which are located at the prospective stomodaeum (at stages 9-11). The second burst of Ttu-Bra expression occurs at the posterior end of stage 16 embryo that undergoes body elongation.

      <str>We have previously shown that the member of the HES family hairy2 induces the ectopic expression of dorsal markers when it is overexpressed in the ventral side of Xenopus embryos. Intriguingly, hairy2 represses the mesoderm transcription factor brachyury (bra) throughout its domain in the marginal zone. Here we show that in early gastrula, bra and hairy2 are expressed in complementary domains. Overexpression of bra repressed hairy2. Interference of bra function with a dominant-negative construct expanded the hairy2 domain and, like hairy2 overexpression, promoted ectopic expression of dorsal axial markers in the ventral side and induced secondary axes without head and notochord. Hairy2 depletion rescued the ectopic dorsal development induced by interference of bra function. We concluded that an intact bra function is necessary to exclude hairy2 expression from the non-organiser field, to impede the ectopic specification of dorsal axial fates and the appearance of incomplete secondary axes. This evidence supports a previously unrecognised role for bra in maintaining the dorsal fates inhibited in the ventral marginal zone, preventing the appearance of trunk duplications.</str>

The median tumor volume was 14.4 cm3 (range, 0.6-65.1 cm3). The median tumor margin dose was 15 Gy (range, 10-20 Gy); the median maximum radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 20-40 Gy). Median clinical and imaging follow-up periods were 4.8 and 4.5 years, respectively.</str>
      <str>Seven chordoma patients (28%) had tumor progression (in-field, n = 3; out-of-field, n = 4), whereas 18 had stable disease or tumor shrinkage.

      <str>A 21-year-old man with nasopharyngeal tumor was  first admitted to the Nagoya University Hospital on April 15, 1972. He had difficulty in speaking and swallowing, and developed double vision prior to admission. A soft and yellow tumor was found in the nasopharynx and revealed typical features of chordoma. The patient underwent Co60 irradiation after the operation. On January 25, 1973, the patient developed double vision of severe degree. Microscopic examination of the specimen which was obtained at the time of the second operation in February 9, 1973, disclosed a coexistence (collision) of chordoma and hemangioblastoma. The two different tumors were situated in juxtaposition on histological examination. Co60 irradiation was added during his second hospitalization. Three months after the second operation, he developed symptoms of meningitis and was hospitalized for the third time on June 3, 1973, at which time the tumor tissue extended through the right frontal and middle fossa. The third operation was done with frontal craniotomy and tumor was partially removed. The histological diagnosis was hemangioblastoma. Postoperatively the patient went downhill and died on September 19, 1973. The report of a collision tumor of intracranial chordoma and hemangioblastoma is not found in the previous literature. There have been many theories as to the origin of collision tumor. Some investigators have proposed that the existence of hyperplastic blood vessels within the glioblastoma is responsible for the collision tumor of sarcoma and glioblastoma. Since the advent of radiotherapy, several examples of sarcoma have been discovered at postmortem examination in patient irradiated for treatment of cerebral neoplasm, both gliogeneous and nongliogenous, suggesting a possible relationship between the tumor and the radiation therapy. In our case, the chordoma showed neither hyperplastic blood vessels nor malignant pattern on histological examination. It was suspected that post-operative radiation induced the hemangioblastoma.

      <str>The development of the hematopoietic system involves multiple cellular steps beginning with the formation of the mesoderm from the primitive streak, followed by emergence of precursor populations that become committed to either the endothelial or hematopoietic lineages. A number of growth factors such as activins and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are known to regulate the early specification of hematopoietic fated mesoderm, notably in amphibians. However, the potential roles of these factors in the development of mesoderm and subsequent hematopoiesis in the human have yet to be delineated. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which combinations of mesoderm-inducing factors regulate this stepwise process in human cells in vitro is central to effectively directing human embryonic stem cell (hESC) hematopoietic differentiation. Herein, using hESC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs), we show that Activin A, but not basic FGF/FGF2 (bFGF), promotes hematopoietic fated mesodermal specification from pluripotent human cells. The effect of Activin A treatment relies on the presence of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and both of the hematopoietic cytokines stem cell factor and fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ligand, and is the consequence of 2 separate mechanisms occurring at 2 different stages of human EB development from mesoderm to blood. While Activin A promotes the induction of mesoderm, as indicated by the upregulation of Brachyury expression, which represents the mesodermal precursor required for hematopoietic development, it also contributes to the expansion of cells already committed to a hematopoietic fate. As hematopoietic development requires the transition through a Brachyury+ intermediate, we demonstrate that hematopoiesis in hESCs is impaired by the downregulation of Brachyury, but is unaffected by its overexpression. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the functional significance of Brachyury in the developmental program of hematopoietic differentiation from hESCs and provide an in-depth understanding of the molecular cues that orchestrate stepwise development of hematopoiesis in a human system.</str>

      <str>Inducible hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell lines represent a model for studying genes involved in self-renewal and differentiation. Here, gene expression was studied in the inducible human CD34+ acute myelogenous leukemia cell line KG1 using oligonucleotide arrays and suppression subtractive cloning. Using this approach, we identified Dlg7, the homolog of the Drosophila Dlg1 tumor suppressor gene, as downregulated at the early stages of KG1 differentiation. Similarly, Dlg7 was expressed in normal purified umbilical cord blood CD34+CD38- progenitors but not in the more committed CD34+CD38+ population. Dlg7 expression was not detected in differentiated cells obtained from hematopoietic colonies, nor was expression detected in purified T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes. When analyzed in different types of stem cells, Dlg7 expression was detected in purified human bone marrow-derived CD133+ progenitor cells, human mesenchymal stem cells, and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Overexpression of Dlg7 in mouse ES cells increased their growth rate and reduced the number of EBs emerging upon differentiation. In addition, the EBs were significantly smaller, indicating an inhibition in differentiation. This inhibition was further supported by higher expression of Bmp4, Oct4, Rex1, and Nanog in EBs overexpressing Dlg7 and lower expression of Brachyury. Finally, the Dlg7 protein was detected in liver and colon carcinoma tumors but not in normal adjacent tissues, suggesting a role for the gene in carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that Dlg7 has a role in stem cell survival, in maintaining stem cell properties, and in carcinogenesis.

      <str>We have previously demonstrated that chordomas express activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRB) and that treatment with imatinib, which is capable of switching off the activation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including PDGFRB, benefits a number of patients. The aim of this study was to identify the possible presence of other activated RTKs and their downstream signaling effectors. Cryopreserved material from 22 naïve sporadic chordomas was investigated for the presence of activated RTKs and their cognate ligands and downstream signaling effectors by means of human phospho-RTK antibody arrays, Western blotting, and molecular analysis; immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to analyze the corresponding formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. We detected activated PDGFRB, FLT3, and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) of the PDGFR family and highly phosphorylated EGFR, HER2/neu, and (to a lesser extent) HER4 of the EGFR family. The detection of PDGFRB/PDGFB confirmed our previous data. The presence of activated EGFR was paralleled by the finding of high levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) and PDGFB co-expression and PDGFRB co-immunoprecipitation. Of the downstream effectors, the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways were both activated, thus leading to the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and 4E-BP1 among the regulators involved in translational control. Taken together, our results (i) provide a rationale for tailored treatments targeting upstream activated receptors, including the PDGFR and EGFR families; (ii) support the idea that a combination of upstream antagonists and mTOR inhibitors enhances the control of tumor growth; and (iii) indicate that the 4E-BP1/eIF4E pathway is a major regulator of protein synthesis in chordoma.</str>

      <str>Understanding the mechanism by which embryonic stem (ES) cells self-renew is crucial for the realization of their therapeutic potential. Earlier, overexpression of Id proteins was shown to be sufficient to maintain mouse ES cells in a self-renewing state even in the absence of serum. Here, we use ES cells derived from Id deficient mice to investigate the requirement for Id proteins in maintaining ES cell self-renewal. We find that Id1(-/-) ES cells have a defect in self-renewal and a propensity to differentiate. We observe that chronic or acute loss of Id1 leads to a down-regulation of Nanog, a critical regulator of self-renewal. In addition, in the absence of Id1, ES cells express elevated levels of Brachyury, a marker of mesendoderm differentiation. We find that loss of both Nanog and Id1 is required for the up-regulation of Brachyury, and ectopic Nanog expression in Id1(-/-) ES cells rescues the self-renewal defect, indicating that Nanog is the major downstream target of Id1. These results identify Id1 as a critical factor in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal and suggest a plausible mechanism for its control of lineage commitment.</str>

      <str>We describe the identification, biochemical characterisation, and mutation of a novel mouse gene: Sp5. Sp5 encodes a protein having a C-terminal C(2)H(2) zinc finger domain closely related to that of the transcription factor Sp1. In vitro, DNA binding studies show that it binds to the GC box, a DNA motif present in the promoter of a very large number of genes, including Brachyury, and recognised by members of the Sp1 family. However, outside of its DNA binding domain, Sp5 has little homology with any other member of the Sp1 family. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of Sp1, Sp5 exhibits a remarkably dynamic pattern of expression throughout early development. This is suggestive of a role in numerous tissue patterning events, including gastrulation and axial elongation; differentiation and patterning of the neural tube, pharyngeal region, and somites; and formation of skeletal muscle in the body and limbs. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in Sp5 show no overt phenotype. However, the enhancement of the T/+ phenotype in compound mutant mice (Sp5(lacZ)/Sp5(lacZ), T/+) indicates a genetic interaction between Sp5 and Brachyury. These observations are consistent with a role for Sp5 in the coordination of changes in transcription required to generate pattern in the developing embryo.</str>

      <str>We report the first cytogenetic investigation of cranial chordoma. Three cranial chordomas were examined, two of which could be further histopathologically classified as chondroid chordomas. In addition, we have included a case of chordoma of a cervical vertebra to compare the cytogenetic abnormalities. Diagnosis was made at histological and immunohistochemical levels. The three cases of cranial chordoma showed a normal karyotype, while one vertebra showed 46,XY,t(6;11)(q12;q23). Chordomas, particularly those containing cartilage, have to be distinguished from chondrosarcomas of the skull base. Such a distinction is normally based on expression of epithelial markers which usually are lacking in chondrosarcoma. Cytogenetic investigation may eventually prove to be useful in the distinction of the two lesions, if chromosome anomalies are consistently absent in chordoma, although some chondrosarcomas may also present a normal karyotype. Such a distinction has clinical implications because chondroid chordomas show better survival, whereas chondrosarcomas show a propensity to infiltrate the surrounding tissues.</str>

Endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed via two nostrils.

      <str>This work concerns the expression of two transcription factors during the development of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus: SpNot, the orthologue of the vertebrate Not gene, and SpBra, the orthologue of the vertebrate Brachyury gene. SpNot transcripts are detected by in situ hybridization in the vegetal plate at the mesenchyme-blastula stage. Later the gene is expressed in the secondary mesenchyme, but expression is no longer detectable after gastrulation. SpNot is upregulated during larval development, in the invaginating vestibule of the adult rudiment. Transcripts are also found in several larva-specific tissues, including the epaulets, blastocoelar cells, and pigment cells. SpBra also displays a discontinuous pattern of expression. Much like SpNot, this gene is expressed during embryogenesis in the embryonic vegetal plate and secondary mesenchyme founder cells, and expression is then extinguished. The gene is upregulated over a week later in the feeding larva, in the vestibule of the adult rudiment. In contrast to SpNot, SpBra is also expressed in the mesoderm of both left and right hydrocoels, and it is not expressed in any larva-specific tissues. We compare the spatial expression profile determined in this study with that of the orthologous Brachyury gene in an indirectly developing enteropneust hemichordate, a representative of the sister group to the echinoderms within the deuterostomes. These observations illuminate the genetic basis underlying the process of maximal indirect development in basal deuterostomes. Finally, Brachyury appears to be an excellent marker for the progeny of the set-aside cells of the sea urchin embryo.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing, locally aggressive, primary bone tumor that arises from the skull base region in approximately 25-35% of cases. The therapeutic approach to chordoma has traditionally been surgery, followed by radiation therapy. The advent of charged particle radiotherapy has let us consider protons as the postoperative treatment of choice, but no controlled studies have yet confirmed the superiority of protons over photons. During January 2008, two independent researchers conducted a systematic review of the current data on the treatment of base of the skull chordoma C with proton therapy (PT) and, for comparison, with other irradiation techniques (conventional radiation therapy, ion therapy, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, and radiosurgery). Two hundred and ten reports in total were retrieved (81 concerning PT). According to the inclusion criteria, 47 articles were considered in the analysis. There were no prospective trials (randomized or nonrandomized) but just seven uncontrolled single-arm studies for PT, providing clinical outcomes for 416 patients in total; these reports were mainly related to advanced inoperable or incompletely resected tumors. The therapeutic approach to chordoma of the base of the skull has traditionally relied on surgical control. Radiation therapy has demonstrated to be a valuable modality for local control in the postoperative setting, particularly with the advent of charged particle radiotherapy. The use of protons has shown better results in comparison to the use of conventional photon irradiation, resulting in the best long-term (10 years) outcome for this tumor with relatively few significant complications considering the high doses delivered with this therapeutic modality.</str>

      <str>To analyze the surgical treatment results and experience of sacral chordoma.</str>
      <str>The data of 51 cases of sacral chordoma surgically treated from July 1997 to July 2007 was retrospectively studied. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 75 years (mean 57 years), including 32 males and 19 females. Forty patients had the first surgery, while other 11 patients were referred to our hospital because of local recurrence from other hospital. Wide resection for all 17 S(3-5) tumors, and wide resection plus piece-meal excision for 34 tumors which involved S(3) above. Reconstruction was performed using pedicle screw and rod device to achieve the continuity between the lumbar spine and the pelvis. The oncologic and functional outcomes of 51 patients were reviewed.</str>
      <str>After a mean duration of follow-up of 3.5 years (range from 15 to 108 months), 5 of 51 patients died of disease. Seventeen of 40 (42.5%) patients who underwent first surgery recurred during follow-up, 18 of 28 patients (64.3%) got re-relapse after second or third surgeries. Postoperative wound complications were as high as 31.6%.</str>
      <str>Chordoma is a biologically aggressive low-grade malignant tumor. Wide resection is a prerequisite for curative treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma, intralesional curettage causes the risk of high local recurrence for which curative resection in a second or third procedure is more difficult to achieve. In order to preserve near normal bowel and bladder function for the tumor which involves S(3) above, wide en-bloc resection plus piece-meal excision in the cephalad is performed.</str>

      <str>Twenty-four patients with chordoma who received one or more courses of megavoltage radiation therapy following biopsy or incomplete resection were reviewed. The uncorrected survival rate at five years was 62%, and at 10 years was 28%, but most patients had clinically detectable residual chordoma present at the time of death or last follow-up. The duration of symptomatic improvement following irradiation ranged from a few months to 18 years, median 3.5 years. Detailed dose-time and symptomatic response data for 56 patients from this series and from the literature who were treated by conventional daily fractionated megavoltage irradiation show no convincing evidence that symptomatic relief is more likely after high doses than after total doses of only 4000 to 5500 cGy. Patients are rarely cured of chordoma by partial tumor resection and conventional radiation. Four patients received multiple fractions of 100 cGy each day either as retreatment for recurrence, or as initial treatment. Symptomatic responses, and decreases in the size of tumor masses, were seen following total doses ranging from 2000 cGy/20 fractions/5 days/4 X 3 hourly fractions each day to 4000 cGy/40 fractions/12 days/4 X 3 hourly fractions each day. The short duration of follow-up in these patients prevents comparison with conventional fractionation. However, this technique presents one possible new approach for the treatment of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Classical mutations at the mouse Brachyury (T) locus were discovered because they lead to shortened tails in heterozygous newborns. no tail (ntl) mutants in the zebrafish, as their name suggests, show a similar phenotype. In Drosophila, mutants in the brachyenteron (byn) gene disrupt hindgut formation. These genes all encode T-box proteins, a class of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and transcription factors. Mutations in the C. elegans mab-9 gene cause massive defects in the male tail because of failed fate decisions in two tail progenitor cells. In a recent paper, Woollard and Hodgkin have cloned the mab-9 gene and found that it too encodes a T-box protein, similar to Brachyury in vertebrates and brachyenteron in Drosophila. The authors suggest that their results support models for an evolutionarily ancient role for these genes in hindgut formation. We will discuss this proposal and try to decide whether the gene sequences, gene interactions and gene expression patterns allow any conclusions to be made about the rear end of the ancestral metazoan.</str>

Brachyury mutant mice, which lack T protein, die in utero with abnormal notochord, posterior somites, and allantois. We have identified human T genomic clones and derived the mRNA sequence and gene structure. There is 91% amino acid identity between human and mouse T proteins overall and complete identity across 77 amino acids of the T-box motif within the DNA-binding domain. Human T expression is very similar to that found for T in other vertebrate species and is confined to cells derived from the notochord. The human T gene maps to chromosome 6q27 and is only the second human member of the T-box gene family to be described.</str>

      <str>Desmin contributes to structural integrity and function of the myocardium but its function seems to be redundant in early cardiomyogenesis in the desmin null mouse model. To test the hypothesis that desmin also plays a supportive role in cardiomyogenic commitment and early differentiation of cardiomyocytes we investigated cardiomyogenesis in embryoid bodies expressing different desmin alleles. Constitutive expression of desmin and increased synthesis during mesoderm formation led to the up-regulation of brachyury and nkx2.5 genes, accelerated early cardiomyogenesis and resulted in the development of large, proliferating, highly interconnected, and synchronously beating cardiomyocyte clusters, whereas desmin null cardiomyocytes featured an opposite phenotype. In contrast, constitutive expression of amino-terminally truncated desmin(Delta1-48) interfered with the beginning of cardiomyogenesis, caused down-regulation of mesodermal and myocardial transcription factors, and hampered myofibrillogenesis and survival of cardiomyocytes. These results provide first evidence that a type III intermediate filament protein takes part in regulating the differentiation of mesoderm to cardiomyocytes at the very beginning of cardiomyogenesis.</str>

      <str>Functional analysis of multiple genes is key to understanding gene regulatory networks controlling embryonic development. We have developed an integrated vector system for inducible gene silencing by shRNAmir-mediated RNA interference in mouse embryos, as a fast method for dissecting mammalian gene function. For validation of the vector system, we generated mutant phenotypes for Brachyury, Foxa2 and Noto, transcription factors which play pivotal roles in embryonic development. Using a series of Brachyury shRNAmir vectors of various strengths we generated hypomorphic and loss of function phenotypes allowing the identification of Brachyury target genes involved in trunk development. We also demonstrate temporal control of gene silencing, thus bypassing early embryonic lethality. Importantly, off-target effects of shRNAmir expression were not detectable. Taken together, the system allows the dissection of gene function at unprecedented detail and speed, and provides tight control of the genetic background minimizing intrinsic variation.</str>

      <str>Intracranial chordomas and chondrosarcomas are histologically low-grade, locally invasive tumors that are reported to be similar in terms of anatomical location, clinical presentation, and radiological findings but different in terms of behavior and outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare clinical outcomes after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for the treatment of intracranial chordoma and chondrosarcoma.</str>
      <str>The authors conducted a retrospective review of the results of radiosurgical treatment of intracranial chordomas and chondrosarcomas. They enrolled patients who had undergone GKS for intracranial chordoma or chondrosarcoma at the Yonsei Gamma Knife Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, from October 2000 through June 2007. Analyses included only patients for whom the disease was pathologically diagnosed before GKS and for whom more than 5 years of follow-up data after GKS were available. Rates of progression-free survival and overall survival were analyzed and compared according to tumor pathology. Moreover, the association between tumor control and the margin radiation dose to the tumor was analyzed, and the rate of tumor volume change after GKS was quantified.</str>
      <str>A total of 10 patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 5 patients underwent a total of 8 sessions of GKS for chordoma, and the other 5 patients underwent a total of 7 sessions of GKS for chondrosarcoma. The 2- and 5-year progression-free survival rates for patients in the chordoma group were 70% and 35%, respectively, and rates for patients in the chondrosarcoma group were 100% and 80%, respectively (log-rank test, p = 0.04). The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates after GKS for patients in the chordoma group were 87.5% and 72.9%, respectively, and rates for patients in the chondrosarcoma group were 100% and 100%, respectively (log-rank test, p = 0.03). The mean rates of tumor volume change 2 years after radiosurgery were 79.64% and 39.91% for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, respectively (p = 0.05). No tumor progression was observed when margin doses greater than 16 Gy for chordoma and 14 Gy for chondrosarcoma were prescribed.</str>
      <str>Outcomes after GKS were more favorable for patients with chondrosarcoma than for those with chordoma. The data also indicated that at 2 years after GKS, the rate of volume change is significantly higher for chordomas than for chondrosarcomas. The authors conclude that radiosurgery with a margin dose of more than 16 Gy for chordomas and more than 14 Gy for chondrosarcomas seems to enhance local tumor control with relatively few complications. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose of GKS for patients with intracranial chordoma or chondrosarcoma.</str>

      <str>In Ciona intestinalis, leprecan was identified as a target of the notochord-specific transcription factor Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) (Takahashi, H., Hotta, K., Erives, A., Di Gregorio, A., Zeller, R.W., Levine, M., Satoh, N., 1999. Brachyury downstream notochord differentiation in the ascidian embryo. Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). By screening approximately 14 kb of the Ci-leprecan locus for cis-regulatory activity, we have identified a 581-bp minimal notochord-specific cis-regulatory module (CRM) whose activity depends upon T-box binding sites located at the 3'-end of its sequence. These sites are specifically bound in vitro by a GST-Ci-Bra fusion protein, and mutations that abolish binding in vitro result in loss or decrease of regulatory activity in vivo. Serial deletions of the 581-bp notochord CRM revealed that this sequence is also able to direct expression in muscle cells through the same T-box sites that are utilized by Ci-Bra in the notochord, which are also bound in vitro by the muscle-specific T-box activators Ci-Tbx6b and Ci-Tbx6c. Additionally, we created plasmids aimed to interfere with the function of Ci-leprecan and categorized the resulting phenotypes, which consist of variable dislocations of notochord cells along the anterior-posterior axis. Together, these observations provide mechanistic insights generally applicable to T-box transcription factors and their target sequences, as well as a first set of clues on the function of Leprecan in early chordate development.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare and a slow-growing tumor originating from the notochord and commonly localized in the skull base.

In the relapsed situations available treatment options are strictly limited; however, recently molecularly targeted agents have been proposed to be of potential beneficial value.</str>
      <str>A 63-year-old male presenting with seizures and an extradural mass in the left brain hemisphere. An attempt to resect the tumor was followed by severe bradycardia when manipulating with the dura and therefore discontinued. It was considered too hazardous even to take a biopsy specimen. The tumor was considered radiologically and macroscopically as a chordoma. As the tumor progressed after radiotherapy, chemotherapy with erlotinib in combination with cetuximab was initiated. This treatment was interrupted due to progressive disease and toxicity. However, combination treatment with erlotinib and bevacizumab normalized the uptake of [11C]methionine PET signal and resulted in a slight tumor shrinkage on MRI. The patient is still (March 2011) free of symptoms, without cranial nerve deficits or seizures.</str>
      <str>This report shows that erlotinib and bevacizumab in combination may completely quench the transport of the essential amino acid methionine to a treatment refractory intracranial tumor bearing radiological and clinical characteristics of a chordoma.

      <str>Chordoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the spine. It is extremely rare and has been studied primarily in single-institution case series. Using data from a large, population-based cancer registry, we designed the present study to examine the outcome for patients with chordoma and to determine relevant prognostic factors.</str>
      <str>A retrospective analysis of the California Cancer Registry database was performed to identify patients with a diagnosis of chordoma in the years 1989 to 2007. Comparisons examined differences in demographics, disease characteristics, treatment, and survival. Survival analyses were performed with use of the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models.</str>
      <str>Four hundred and nine patients with chordoma were identified; 257 (62.8%) were male and 152 (37.2%) were female. With regard to racial or ethnic distribution, 266 patients (65%) were white; ninety-three (22.7%), Hispanic; forty-three (10.5%), Asian or other; and seven (1.7%), black. The site of presentation was the head in 202 patients (49.4%), spine in 106 patients (25.9%), and pelvis and/or sacrum in 101 patients (24.7%). Hispanic race (p = 0.0002), younger age (less than forty years; p &lt; 0.0001), and female sex (p = 0.009) were associated with cranial presentation, whereas older age (forty years or older; p &lt; 0.0001) was associated with pelvic presentation. After adjustment for clinically relevant factors, a significantly decreased risk of death for chordoma-specific survival was seen for Hispanic race (hazard ratio = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.28 to 0.93; p = 0.03), high socioeconomic status (hazard ratio = 0.8, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; p = 0.01), and local excision and/or debulking (hazard ratio = 0.38, 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.81; p = 0.01). Large tumor size was independently associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.20; p = 0.048).</str>

      <str>Chordoma is the fourth most common malignant primary neoplasm of the skeleton and almost the only one showing a real epithelial phenotype. Besides classic chordoma, so-called chondroid chordoma was described as a specific entity showing cartilage-like tissue within chordomatoid structures. However, since its first description, strongly conflicting results have been reported about the existence of chondroid chordoma and several studies suggested chondroid chordomas being in fact low-grade conventional chondrosarcomas. In the present study, we used cytoprotein expression profiling and molecular in situ localization techniques of marker gene products indicative of developmental phenotypes of chondrocytes to elucidate origin and biology of chondroid chordoma. We were able to demonstrate the chondrogenic potential of chordomas irrespectively of the appearance of overt cartilage formation by identifying the multifocal expression of type II collagen, the main marker of chondrocytic differentiation. Additionally, the cartilage-typical large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was present throughout all chordomas and, thus, a very characteristic gene product and marker of these neoplasms. Biochemical matrix composition and cell differentiation pattern analysis showed a high resemblance of classic chordomas and in chordoid areas of chondroid chordomas to the fetal chorda dorsalis, whereas chondroid areas of chondroid chordomas showed features similar to adult nucleus pulposus. This demonstrates on the cell function level the chondrocytic differentiation potential of neoplastic chordoid cells as a characteristic facet of chordomas, mimicking fetal vertebral development, ie, the transition of the chorda dorsalis to the nucleus pulposus. Our study firmly establishes a focal real chondrocytic phenotype of neoplastic cells in chordomas. Chondroid chordoma is neither a low-grade chondrosarcoma nor a misnomer as discussed previously.</str>

Recently videolaparoscopy has been proposed when an anterior approach is indicated without increased morbidity or mortality. Chemotherapy is not indicated because low tumoral responsness. Radiotherapy is indicated as a palliative procedure when a surgical approach ca't be radical.

      <str>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate in vivo and in vitro into all cell lineages, and they have been proposed as cellular therapy for human diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling ESC commitment toward specific lineages need to be specified. We previously found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathway inhibits neurogenesis and is necessary to mesodermal formation during the critical first 5 days of mouse ESC commitment. This period corresponds to the expression of specific master genes that direct ESC into each of the three embryonic layers. By both chemical and genetic approaches, we found now that, during this phase, the p38MAPK pathway stabilizes the p53 protein level and that interfering directly with p53 mimics the effects of p38MAPK inhibition on ESC differentiation. Anti-p53 siRNA transient transfections stimulate Bcl2 and Pax6 gene expressions, leading to increased ESC neurogenesis compared with control transfections. Conversely, p53 downregulation leads to a strong inhibition of the mesodermal master genes Brachyury and Mesp1 affecting cardiomyogenesis and skeletal myogenesis of ESCs. Similar results were found with p53(-/-) ESCs compared with their wild-type counterparts. In addition, knockout p53 ESCs show impaired smooth muscle cell and adipocyte formation. Use of anti-Nanog siRNAs demonstrates that certain of these regulations result partially to p53-dependent repression of Nanog gene expression. In addition to its well-known role in DNA-damage response, apoptosis, cell cycle control and tumor suppression, p53 has also been involved in vivo in embryonic development; our results show now that p53 mediates, at least for a large part, the p38MAPK control of the early commitment of ESCs toward mesodermal and neural lineages.</str>

      <str>Despite conventional multimodality treatment (surgery and fractionated radiation therapy), recurrence and clinical progression of cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas are common. The malignant behavior of these tumors is a result of their critical location, locally aggressive nature, and high recurrence rate. To explore the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of these skull base neoplasms, we assessed its use in four patients with chordoma and two with chondrosarcoma. In five of the patients, radiosurgery was used as adjuvant therapy for residual or recurrent tumors after surgical debulking, and in one patient with a chordoma, it was the primary treatment. No patient received fractionated external beam radiotherapy. All tumors were less than 30 mm in diameter and were treated with 20 Gy to the tumor margin. Skull base computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were essential to define the anatomic relationships between tumor and adjacent basal structures. During follow-up (mean, 22 mo; range, 8-36 mo), we found no progression of the treated tumor volume in any patient. Neurological deficits before treatment improved in three patients; the other three patients remained in stable neurological condition. Serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated that two patients showed reduction in tumor size and four patients had no tumor growth. In one patient, a metastatic parietal lobe chondrosarcoma developed and was treated by microsurgery. Another patient showed tumor progression outside of the radiosurgical treatment volume. Our results attest to the value of stereotactic radiosurgery as an adjuvant or primary treatment for selected patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma and demonstrate its potential advantages over standard fractionated irradiation. Analysis of the long-term clinical and imaging effects after radiosurgery is warranted.</str>

      <str>Brachyury (T) is involved in mesoderm induction during early mouse development. T expression in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells, which differentiate into mesoderm derivatives in vitro, was studied. Endogenous T expression in P19 cells was transiently induced when the cells were allowed to form aggregates. This expression was enhanced by dimethyl sulfoxide. In situ hybridization showed that T expressing cells formed clusters on the aggregates. Transfection of plasmids encoding reporter genes under the control of the upstream region of T showed that the sequence up to -351 bp can resemble the differentiation-dependent expression of T in P19 cells. To define the promoter region regulating T expression, transgenic mice carrying LacZ under the control of the upstream region were prepared. The region up to -351 bp is sufficient to direct the expression in the primitive streak and tail-bud. The upstream region up to -2400 bp does not support expression in the notochord. The sequence between -987 and -585 bp enhances expression in the primitive streak and tail-bud. In the tail-bud where new cells for elongation of the anteroposterior axis were continuously supplied, the sequence up to -987 bp drove lacZ expression in gut endoderm and prospective neuroectoderm as well as in mesoderm derivatives.</str>

      <str>Thirty-five chordomas and more than 100 other tumors that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis, were immunohistochemically analyzed using a panel of antibodies including those to subsets of keratins (K), HBME-1, a monoclonal antibody recognizing an unknown antigen on mesothelial cells, and neuroendocrine markers. The patterns of immunoreactivities in chordoma were compared with those in renal cell carcinoma, colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma, pituitary adenoma, skeletal chondrosarcoma, and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (ESMC). Chordomas were consistently positive for keratin cocktail AE1/AE3, and for the individual keratins K8 and K19, and nearly always positive for K5, but they showed negative or only sporadic reactivity for K7 and K20. The keratin K8 and K19 reactivity was retained in those chordomas showing solid sheets of epithelioid, spindle cells, or cartilaginous metaplasia, and in one of two cases showing overtly sarcomatous transformation. In comparison, keratins were never present in skeletal chondrosarcoma, although K8 and to a lesser extent K19 were seen in occasional cases of ESMC with chordoid features. HBME-1 reacted strongly with chordoma and skeletal chondrosarcoma but was almost never positive in renal or colorectal carcinoma. These carcinomas lacked K5-reactivity, in contrast to chordoma. Chordomas were also consistently positive for neuron-specific enolase and occasionally focally for synaptophysin, but never for chromogranin. In contrast, pituitary adenomas regularly expressed the full spectrum of neuroendocrine markers and differed from chordoma by having a narrower repertoire of keratins, often showing negative or focal keratin 8- or AE1/AE3 reactivity and being almost always K19-negative. These findings indicate that chordoma can be immunohistochemically separated from tumors that can resemble it. Immunohistochemistry is especially useful in the diagnosis of small biopsy specimens that offer limited material for morphological observation.</str>

      <str>Holt-Oram syndrome is caused by mutations in TBX5, a member of the T-box gene family. In order to identify DNA sequences to which the TBX5 protein binds, we have performed an in vitro binding site selection assay. We have identified an 8 bp core sequence that is part of the Brachyury consensus-binding site. We show that TBX5 binds to the full palindromic Brachyury binding site and to the half-palindrome, whereas Brachyury does not bind to the TBX5 site. Amino acids 1-237 of TBX5 are required for DNA binding. Analysis of the effects of specific substitution mutations that arise in Holt-Oram patients indicates that G80R and R237Q eliminate binding to the target site. DNA database analysis reveals that target sites are present in the upstream regions of several cardiac-expressed genes including cardiac alpha actin, atrial natriuretic factor, cardiac myosin heavy chain alpha, cardiac myosin heavy chain beta, myosin light chain 1A, myosin light chain 1V and Nkx2.5. Cell transfection studies demonstrate that TBX5 activates the transcription of an atrial natriuretic factor reporter construct and this effect is significantly reduced by deletion of the TBX5 binding site.</str>

      <str>The T-box genes, including Brachyury, encode a novel family of transcription factors that play critical roles in various processes of development, in particular, mesoderm formation in chordate embryos. In the case of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, the Brachyury (As-T) is expressed exclusively in notochord cells, whereas another T-box gene (As-T2) is expressed in the muscle cells and in the tip of the tail of tailbud embryos. In a previous study, we suggested that the combined pattern of the spatial expressions of As-T and As-T2 appears to correspond to that of a single vertebrate Brachyury gene (Yasuo et al., Dev Biol 1996;180:773-779). The present molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that As-T2 is a divergent member of the T-box family with a similarity to the Tbx6 subfamily. Vertebrate members of this subfamily are expressed in the posterior paraxial mesoderm, and the mouse Tbx6 is essential for the specification of posterior somite. To investigate the function of As-T2, we examined an ectopic- and/or overexpression of this gene by injecting synthetic mRNA into fertilized eggs. The results showed that the injection of As-T2 mRNA induced an ectopic expression of muscle-specific myosin heavy-chain gene and actin gene, especially in presumptive epidermal cells. This ectopic muscle-specific expression was accompanied by the partial suppression of an epidermis-specific gene expression. The overexpression of As-T2, however, rarely affected the expression of As-T (Brachyury) and genes that are expressed in the tailbud.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for notochord differentiation in vertebrates. We have identified a Drosophila gene, the T-related gene (Trg), with high similarity to T within a stretch of approximately 200 amino acids, the DNA-binding domain of T. Trg is expressed throughout embryogenesis, first at the blastoderm stage in the hindgut primordium under the control of the terminal gap genes tll and hkb, and then until the end of embryogenesis in the differentiating hindgut. Drosophila embryos deficient for Trg do not form the hindgut, a phenotype that can be rescued by a Trg transgene. Thus, a common feature of T and Trg is their requirement in specifying the development of a single embryonic structure. Homologs of Trg are also expressed in the developing hindgut of Tribolium and Locusta embryos suggesting a highly conserved function of Trg in insects. This conservation and the high similarity of T and Trg raise the question of a common evolutionary origin of the hindgut of insects and the notochord of chordates.</str>

The transgenic lines were made using a technique in which the endonuclease I-SceI was coinjected into fertilized eggs with a transgene construct containing flanking recognition sites for I-SceI. Two founder animals, out of 12 F(0) adults tested, were found to transmit the transgene to their offspring (F(1)s) at frequencies of 42% and 23%. The transgene was further inherited by the F(2) in a Mendelian fashion and displayed nonmosaic expression, indicating integration into the genome. The Mendelian inheritance and the absence of mosaicism persisted through the F(3) and F(4) generations. Southern blot analyses showed that the transgene was organized in tandem arrays of no more than 10 copies.

      <str>The mouse T (Brachyury) gene is required for normal mesoderm development and the extension of the body axis. Recently, two mutant alleles of a zebrafish gene, no tail (ntl), have been isolated (Halpern, M. E., Ho., R. K., Walker, C. and Kimmel, C. B. (1993) Cell 75, 99-111). ntl mutant embryos resemble mouse T/T mutant embryos in that they lack a differentiated notochord and the caudal region of their bodies. We report here that this phenotype is caused by mutation of the zebrafish homologue of the T gene. While ntl embryos express mutant mRNA, they show no nuclear protein product. Later, expression of mRNA in mutants, but not in wild types, is greatly reduced along the dorsal midline where the notochord normally forms. This suggests that the protein is required for maintaining transcription of its own gene.</str>

Here, I report that a Xbra mutant truncated at the carboxyl terminus, B304, has lost the mesodermalizing activity and can block the activity of the wild-type Xbra. Injection of B304 mRNA led to formation of neural structures in animal cap explants. Examination of molecular markers in B304-injected explants shows expression of anterior neural markers in the absence of mesodermal markers, indicating that B304 can cause neuralization without the mediation of mesoderm. Implications of these findings on intracellular mechanisms underlying the initiation of neural differentiation in the ectodermal cells are discussed.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor BRACHYURY (T) is a key regulator of mesoderm formation during early development. Complete loss of T has been shown to lead to embryonic lethality around E10.0. Here we characterize an inducible miRNA-based in vivo knockdown mouse model of T, termed KD3-T, which exhibits a hypomorphic phenotype. KD3-T embryos display axial skeletal defects caused by apoptosis of paraxial mesoderm, which is accompanied by urorectal malformations resembling the murine uro-recto-caudal syndrome and human caudal regression syndrome phenotypes. We show that there is a reduction of T in the notochord of KD3-T embryos which results in impaired notochord differentiation and its subsequent loss, whereas levels of T in the tailbud are sufficient for axis extension and patterning. Furthermore, the notochord in KD3-T embryos adopts a neural character and loses its ability to act as a signaling center. Since KD3-T animals survive until birth, they are useful for examining later roles for T in the development of urorectal tissues.</str>

      <str>Brachyury (T) mutant embryos are deficient in mesoderm formation and do not complete axial development. The notochord is most strongly affected. The T gene is expressed transiently in primitive streak-derived nascent and migrating mesoderm cells and continuously in the notochord. Ectopic expression of T protein in the animal cap of Xenopus embryos results in ectopic mesoderm formation. The T protein is located in the nucleus. These and other data suggested that the T gene might be involved in the control of transcriptional regulation. In an attempt to demonstrate specific DNA binding of the T protein we have identified a consensus sequence among DNA fragments selected from a mixture of random oligomers. Under our experimental conditions T protein binds as a monomer to DNA. This property resides in the N-terminal domain of 229 amino acid residues which is strongly conserved between the mouse protein, and its Xenopus and zebrafish homologues. The latter proteins also recognize the consensus DNA binding site. We suggest that the T protein is involved in the control of genes required for mesoderm formation, and for the differentiation and function of chorda mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors that are usually located in the sacrococcygeal and sphenooccipital region. Their cytologic diagnosis is rather straightforward when sampled by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) from these characteristic locations, especially when physalipherous cells are present. However, chordomas may pose difficult diagnostic challenges when encountered in unusual locations, such as the parapharyngeal region. We report the cytologic findings of a recurrent chordoma sampled through transoral FNA from the parapharyngeal space of a 66-year-old woman. As the prior history of chordoma was not available during the rapid onsite evaluation, the presence of bland epithelioid nonvacuolated cells and spindle cells intimately admixed with a fibrillary, intensely metachromatic material led to an initial diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. Review of the patient's prior pathology specimen and of the Papanicolaou-stained smears and cellblock sections showing rare multivacuolated (physalipherous) cells led to the correct diagnosis, which was supported by immunoperoxidase stains (cytokeratin AE1/AE3+, S100+, GFAP-). A review of the literature found no previous instances in which chordomas mimicked pleomorphic adenoma on FNA. However, since the two tumors show significant cytomorphologic overlap, including the presence of abundant fibrillary matrix with embedded neoplastic cells and single bland spindle and epithelioid tumor cells with occasional intranuclear pseudoinclusions, we compared their cytologic features. A review of the FNA cytologic features of this case of chordoma and of 17 consecutive cases of pleomorphic adenoma found that the presence of a more abundant, focally vacuolated cytoplasm favors chordoma over pleomorphic adenoma.</str>

      <str>Our review demonstrated that dysphagia and cervicalgia were the most common presenting symptoms for cervical chordoma. The mean age of diagnosis in this cohort was 52.4 years and our mean follow-up is 54.7 months. All five patients required multistage procedures to achieve en bloc tumor excision. Independent analysis of the surgical margins by the pathologists revealed that marginal en bloc excisions were achieved in all five patients. Our 30-day perioperative complication was significant for one case of transient radiculopathy with paresis and one wound infection. Other long-term complications included three cases with pseudoarthrosis with instrumentation failures requiring surgical revisions. There were no neurological or cerebrovascular complications.

      <str>Three hundred forty-two patients who underwent surgical resection of a malignant primary osseous spinal neoplasm (114 chordoma, 156 chondrosarcoma, and 72 osteosarcoma) were identified. Overall median survival after surgical resection was histology specific (osteosarcoma: 22 months; chordoma: 100 months; and chondrosarcoma: 160 months). Increasing age (years) and increasing tumor invasion (confined to periosteum; invasion through periosteum into adjacent tissues; and distal site metastasis) were the only variables independently associated with decreased survival (p&lt;.05) for all tumor types. For spinal chordoma, sacrum/pelvic location (p&lt;.05) and earlier year of surgery (p&lt;.005) were also independently associated with decreased survival. Using variables of patient age, extent of local tumor invasion, and metastasis status in a five-point grading scale, increasing score (1-5) closely correlated (p&lt;.001) with decreased survival for chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma.</str>
      <str>In our analysis of a US population-based cancer registry (SEER), a grading scale consisting of age, metastasis status, and extent of local tumor invasion was associated with overall survival after surgical resection of chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma of the spine. Although this analysis could not take into account specific chemotherapy regimens and variations in surgical technique, this grading scale may offer valuable prognostic data based on variables available to the surgeon and patient before surgery and may help guide level of aggressiveness in subsequent treatment strategies.</str>

      <str>The small heat-shock protein HSP25 is expressed in the heart early during development, and although multiple roles for HSP25 have been proposed, its specific role during development and differentiation is not known. P19 is an embryonal carcinoma cell line which can be induced to differentiate in vitro into either cardiomyocytes or neurons. We have used P19 to examine the role of HSP25 in differentiation. We found that HSP25 expression is strongly increased in P19 cardiomyocytes. Antisense HSP25 expression reduced the extent of cardiomyocyte differentiation and resulted in reduced expression of cardiac actin and the intermediate filament desmin and reduced level of cardiac mRNAs. Thus, HSP25 is necessary for differentiation of P19 into cardiomyocytes. In contrast, P19 neurons did not express HSP25 and antisense HSP25 expression had no effect on neuronal differentiation. The phosphorylation of HSP25 by the p38/SAPK2 pathway is known to be important for certain of its functions. Inhibition of this pathway by the specific inhibitor SB203580 prevented cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19 cells. In contrast, PD90589, which inhibits the ERK1/2 pathway, had no effect. Surprisingly, cardiogenesis was only sensitive to SB203580 during the first 2 days of differentiation, before HSP25 expression increases. In contrast to the effect of antisense HSP25, SB203580 reduced the level of expression of the mesodermal marker Brachyury-T during differentiation. Therefore, we propose that the p38 pathway acts on an essential target during early cardiogenesis. Once this initial step is complete, HSP25 is necessary for the functional differentiation of P19 cardiomyocytes, but its phosphorylation by p38/SAPK2 is not required.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is an uncommon malignant tumor with unusual characteristics developing in the remnants of the notochord and usually manifesting itself in patients in their forties and fifties. It is usually located in the body's symmetrical axis or attached to it. The pathological structure is rather characteristic to benign tumors. Although not painful, it is a mercilessly aggressive local tumor, in some cases resulting metastatic progression and might alter its histological picture in long-lived patients. It is found most prevalently (about 60 percent) in the sacrococcygeal region and at the clivus and manifesting itself spinally (over the sacrum) most likely in the lumbar region. Between 1992 and 2002, the authors have treated surgically 37 patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma. They applied wide resection following which only seven patients required re-operation. They show detailed data regarding this patient group and discuss the technical aspects of the wide tumor-resection.</str>

In the first case, a 52 year-old male patient, a large parasellar mass invading the cavernous sinus, infiltrating the infratemporal fossa and extending as low as C2 was founded. The tumor was isointense on T1, enhanced strongly with gadolinium injection, and was hyperintense on T2. In the second case, a 19-year-old male patient, a large high density temporal right mass was disclosed by CT scan. Both patients were taken to surgery. In the first case, only a partial removal was possible to be accomplished due to a severe intra operative bleeding. In the second case, the tumor was totally removed. Both showed characteristic pathologic findings of a meningioma resembling a chordoma.

      <str>A 64-year-old woman presented with right heart failure caused by a cardiac tumor centered in the free wall of the right ventricle, accompanied by pericardial effusion. A match between the biopsy specimen and tissue removed 4 years earlier resulted in the diagnosis of a cardiac metastasis from a chordoma. Immunohistochemical staining was also useful in establishing the diagnosis. To alleviate the right ventricular outflow obstruction, a palliative operation was planned, resecting the tumor and performing a right ventriculoplasty, which was cancelled due to the extent of infiltration of the tumor, and instead a right atrium to pulmonary artery shunt was attempted using a vascular prosthesis, only to fail due to an inability to maintain blood flow through the prosthesis. Presently there are no definitive treatment options available, and some palliative chemotherapy is being performed. Single cardiac metastases from a chordoma are extremely rare.</str>

The tumors showed histopathological features typical of chondroid chordoma and contained both classical chordomatous and hyaline cartilaginous components. Tumor cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin, vimentin, and S-100 protein, but negative for microtubule-associated protein 2 and class III beta-tubulin (tub-B3). Tumor cells of case 2 were immunoreactive for tau-protein and class II beta-tubulin (tub-B2), whereas those of case 1 were negative. Ultrastructurally, tumor cells in both cases showed the presence of abundant glycogen granules, well-developed intracellular organelles, and desmosome-like junctions. In case 2, several microtubules were closely packed and ran parallel or in random directions within the dilated cisterns of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER). "Microtubules within rough ER" has been described in several neoplasms, including classical and chondroid chordomas. Although previous reports documented the tub-B3 immunoreactivity in chordomas, our results suggested that, in our case 2, the predominant isoform of beta-tubulin in microtubules within rough ER was not tub-B3 but tub-B2.</str>

      <str>Prognosis of chordoma arising in the sacrococcygeal area is difficult to assess because of the small number cases and lack of statistics in Japan. From the bone tumor registry we selected records on sacrococcygeal chordoma cases and sent a questionnaire to many hospitals regarding staging, surgical approach, surgical procedure, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, complications and prognosis of this tumor. The results of the questionnaire (32 cases) showed that combined surgery and radiotherapy were the best methods. This survival rate was 85% in five years and 43% in ten years. In the surgical procedure the extralesional excision resulted in a high recurrence rate (73%) three years after operation, and in the case of intralesional excision an even higher rate (91%). We assume this is a problem of the excisional method. In the staging system, the intracompartment tumors have a better prognosis. Early stage discovery and surgical treatment is of vital importance.</str>

      <str>Spinal chordomas are more often located on the midline and are associated with marked destruction of the vertebral bodies. We report a rare case of large cervical (C2-C3) right lateral paravertebral chordoma extending into the spinal canal through a very enlarged intervertebral foramen. The tumor was initially diagnosed as a mucous adenocarcinoma on a percutaneous needle biopsy. However, the neuroradiological features, including the well-defined tumor margins, the regular and sclerosing lytic bone changes with regular enlargement of the intervertebral C2-C3 foramen, were in favor of a more slowly growing lesion, such as schwannoma or neurofibroma. At surgery a well-demarcated capsulated tumor involving the nerve root was partially resected. Histology was in favor of a low-grade chordoma (Ki-67/MIB-1&lt;1%). Postoperative proton beam therapy was also performed. The differential neuroradiological diagnosis is discussed. </str>

      <str>A 21-year old woman underwent surgery in December 1996 for the removal of a presumed tuberculum sellae meningioma. However, some radio-clinical findings were proved somewhat intriguing:the patient's age, the presence of inflammatory and febrile syndromes together with the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis associated with perilesional edema intensity (an unusual feature in such cases) made us challenge the initial neuroradiological diagnosis evoked in connection with the tumoral location and dural attachment pattern. A right sub-fronto-temporal approach allowed complete tumor resection (confirmed with a postoperative MRI) and clinical recovery of the patient. But while pathological examination suggested a chordoma, the study of immunohistochemical stains revealed a meningioma. The final diagnosis was chordoid meningioma. Our review of the literature has shown that chordoid meningiomas display several areas of physaliferous cells which give the tumor a chordoma-like aspect. However, the results of immunohistochemical studies along with the location of the tumor were not consistent with the diagnosis of chordoma. Eight cases of chordoid meningiomas are reviewed in the literature. They are described as inducing systemic symptoms, particularly anemia. They could also be linked to Castleman's syndrome according to Kepes et al. After careful evaluation, we retained the hypothesis of a cause and effect relationship between the local and generalised inflammatory syndrome and chordoid meningioma.</str>

      <str>Mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells can differentiate into various cell types depending on culture conditions. Here we show that the expression of the mesodermal genes Brachyury (Bra) and Goosecoid (Gsc) are under regulatory control in P19 cells. When P19 cells were cultured in a tissue culture dish in the presence of serum, Bra and Gsc were unexpectedly expressed. Expression of Bra and Gsc was greatly reduced with culture time, and expression levels at 144 h of culture were below 25% those at 48 h of culture. Members of the Tgf-beta family such as Activin and Nodal have been known to up-regulate expression of mesodermal genes. Treatment with SB431542, an Alk4/5/7 inhibitor, decreased Bra and Gsc in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it induced the expression of the neuroectodermal genes Mash-1 and Pax-6. Quantitative RT-PCR and dsRNAi transfection indicated Nodal as a possible ligand responsible for the regulation of Bra and Gsc. In addition, exogenous Nodal increased expression of Bra and Gsc in a dose-dependent manner. Serum concentration in culture medium positively related to expression of Nodal, Bra, Gsc, and Cripto, which encodes a membrane-tethered protein required for Nodal signaling. Addition of the culture supernatant of P19 cells at 144 h of culture to medium decreased expression of these genes. The present study reveals that stimulation and inhibition of the Nodal pathway increases mesodermal genes and neuroectodermal genes, respectively, indicating the importance of control of Nodal and Cripto expression for mesodermal formation and neurogenesis.</str>

      <str>Although aggressive surgical resection has been recommended for the treatment of chordomas, wide exposure of the tumors in the upper cervical region is a challenge.</str>
      <str>A 19-year-old man presented with a large ossified retropharyngeal chordoma (6 cm in diameter) originating from the right side of the anterior arch of C1, and extending from the clivus to the C2/3 intervertebral disc level in the sagittal plane. A posterior occipitocervical (O-C3) fusion with an iliac bone graft was first performed. Ten days after the fusion, the tumor was resected using a mandible and tongue midsplitting approach combined with a Le Fort I (transmaxillary) osteotomy, which allowed us to expose the entire tumor. The tumor was hard and immovable because of ossification. The main part of the tumor was resected from the anterior arch of C1, and then the C1 anterior arch was resected en bloc. The retropharyngeal wall was reconstructed using a vascularized radial forearm flap. Radiation therapy (60 Gy) was performed after surgery.</str>
      <str>No local recurrence or metastasis was observed 3 years after the operation. The patient had no complaints and has returned to his previous job as a manual laborer.</str>

      <str>The management of clival chordoma remains problematic. We present the case of a 48-year-old woman with clival chordoma who underwent multiple surgeries and radiation therapy, including gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GK-SRS), during a 10-year clinical course. The tumor was initially removed by gross total resection via the trans-sphenoidal approach, followed by external linac radiation therapy. The tumor recurred at the clivus 5 years after the initial operation. After repeated trans-sphenoidal removal of recurrent tumors, she twice underwent GK-SRS for a tumor remnant adjacent to the brainstem. Although this part of the tumor was controlled by GK-SRS, there was further tumor extension toward the sphenoid and maxillary sinuses. Ultimately, lower cranial nerve dysfunction developed due to tumor extension into the lower part of the clivus and the patient died of respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed the tumor to extend from the lower clivus to the bilateral middle fossae. The lower part of the tumor extended to the nasal cavity and to the posterior wall of the pharynx, resulting in compression of the upper pharyngeal region. The tumor around the jugular foramen compressed the lower cranial nerves bilaterally. Tumor cells did not, however, invade the intradural space microscopically. Although chordoma is not biologically malignant, this tumor can show massive extension with destruction of bony structures and extracranial invasion of connective tissues. Therefore, the optimal treatment strategy is to remove the tumor mass as extensively as possible, including normal bony structures and connective tissues surrounding the tumor, using skull base surgical techniques.</str>

      <str>While nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), a transcription factor implicated in osmotic stress response, is suggested to be involved in other processes such as migration and proliferation, its role in cardiomyogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of NFAT5 in cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells, and observed that it was abundantly expressed in undifferentiated P19CL6 cells, and its protein expression was significantly downregulated by enhanced proteasomal degradation during DMSO-induced cardiomyogenesis. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of NFAT5 markedly attenuated cardiomyogenesis, which was associated with the inhibition of mesodermal differentiation. TOPflash reporter assay revealed that the transcriptional activity of canonical Wnt signaling was activated prior to mesodermal differentiation, and this activation was markedly attenuated by NFAT5 inhibition. Pharmacological activation of canonical Wnt signaling by [2'Z, 3'E]-6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO) restored Brachyury expression in NFAT5DN-expressing cells. Inhibition of NFAT5 markedly attenuated Wnt3 and Wnt3a induction. Expression of Dkk1 and Cerberus1, which are secreted Wnt antagonists, was also inhibited by NFAT5 inhibition. Thus, endogenous NFAT5 regulates the coordinated expression of Wnt ligands and antagonists, which are essential for cardiomyogenesis through the canonical Wnt pathway. These results demonstrated a novel role of NFAT5 in cardiac differentiation of stem cells.</str>

Additionally, the outcome in patients with chordoma-induced metastastic neoplasms remains unclear. The authors performed a retrospective review of the neurosurgery database at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to determine the incidence of metastatic disease in a contemporary series of spinal and sacrococcygeal chordoma as well as to determine the outcomes.</str>
      <str>Thirty-seven patients underwent surgery for spinal and sacrococcygeal chordoma between June 1, 1993, and March 31, 2004. All records were reviewed, and appropriate statistical analyses were used to compare patient data for preoperative characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. The authors identified seven patients (19%) in whom metastatic disease developed; in three the disease had metastasized to the lungs only, in two to the lungs and liver, and in two to distant locations in the spine. There were no significant differences in age, sex, tumor location, or history of radiation treatments between patients with and those without metastases. In cases with local recurrent tumors, metastastic disease was more likely to develop than in those without recurrence (28 compared with 0%, respectively; p = 0.07). In two (12%) of 17 patients who underwent en bloc resection, metastatic disease developed, whereas it developed in five (25%) of 20 patients treated by curettage (p = 0.42). The median time from first surgery to the appearance of metastatic disease, as calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 143.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.8-219.9). The median survival duration of patients with metastatic disease after the first surgery was 106 months (95% CI 55.7-155.7), and this did not differ significantly from that in patients in whom no metastases developed (p = 0.93).</str>

      <str>Feeder cells are essential for the establishment and culture of pluripotent rat embryonic stem cells (ESC) in vitro. Therefore, we tested several fibroblast and epithelial cell lines derived from the female genital tract as feeder cells to further improve ESC culture conditions. The immortalized tumor derived rat fibroblast TRF-O3 cells isolated from a Dnd1-deficient teratoma were identified as optimal feeder cells supporting stemness and proliferation of rat ESC. The TRF-O3 cells were characterized as myofibroblasts by expression of fibroblast specific genes alpha-2 type I collagen, collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha (II), vimentin, S100A4, and smooth muscle α-actin. Culture of inner cell masses (ICM) derived from WKY/Ztm rat blastocysts in 2i-LIF medium on TRF-O3 feeder cells lacking LIF, SCF and FGF2 expression resulted in pluripotent and germ-line competent rat ESC lines. Therein, genotyping confirmed up to 26% male ESC lines. On the other hand the TRF-O3 specific BMP4 expression was correlated with transcriptional activity of the mesodermal marker T-brachyury and the ectoderm specific nestin in the ESC line ES21 demonstrating mesodermal or ectodermal cell lineage differentiation processes within the ESC population. Substitution of 2i-LIF by serum-containing YPAC medium supplemented with TGF-β and rho kinase inhibitors or by 4i medium in combination with TRF-O3 feeder cells led to enhanced differentiation of ES21 cells and freshly isolated ICMs. These results suggest that the ESC culture conditions using TRF-O3 feeder cells and 2i-LIF medium supported the establishment of male ESC lines from WKY/Ztm rats, which represent a favored, permissive genetic background for rat ESC culture. </str>

The abnormal accumulation of tau proteins in neurofibrillary tangles is a well-known phenomenon and has been studied extensively. However, the role of tau protein in chondroid tissue and its neoplasia is unknown. In the present study, 2 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMCs), 6 chordomas, 6 chondrosarcomas, 3 myxoid chondrosarcomas of bone, 2 osteochondromas, 6 chondroblastomas, and 2 nonneoplastic adult articular cartilages were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies against tau proteins and tubulin. The results showed that the coexpression of tau proteins and tubulin was present only in EMCs (2/2) and chordomas (4/6). Although tubulin was detected in chondroblastomas (5/6), osteochondromas (2/2), chondrosarcomas (5/6), and myxoid-chondrosarcomas of bone (3/3), tau expression was absent in these tumors. The perichondrial chondroblasts but not chondrocytes from nonneoplastic articular cartilage also localize tau and tubulin with a much weaker staining intensity. The results mainly demonstrate that there is frequent expression of tau proteins in some microtubule-rich neoplasms, such as EMC and chordoma. The different immunostaining pattern of tau proteins between chordoma and myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone may be useful in the differential diagnosis, especially when both neoplasms occur in the base of skull.</str>

Consistent with an embryologically derived hemangioblast, the neoplastic cells demonstrated coexpression of the mesodermal markers brachyury, Flk-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor-2), and stem cell leukemia (Scl). The neoplastic cells also expressed hematopoietic stem cell antigens and receptors including CD133, CD34, c-kit, Scl, erythropoietin, and erythropoietin receptor.

      <str>The study included 40 patients, 27 men and 13 women (2:1), with chordoma of the mobile spine. Their clinical and histopathologic features are described.</str>
      <str>Nineteen tumors (48%) were located in the cervical spine, 7 (17%) in the thoracic spine, and 14 (35%) in the lumbar area. Most patients underwent subtotal removal of the tumor and postoperative irradiation. Variations in histologic appearance, including an occasional chondroid background, did not affect biologic behavior. Twenty-three patients (58%) were alive 5 years after surgery. Eventually, 25 patients (63%) died of tumor. Metastasis developed in two patients (5%). In contrast to some other studies metastasis was a rare occurrence.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade malignant tumor involving the axial spine. Cytogenetic data on these tumors have been limited to 25 cases. The findings of clonal chromosome aberrations in five new cases are presented. One of these and two previously reported cases have been studied with multicolor combined binary ratio labeling fluorescence in situ hybridization (COBRA-FISH). The karyotypes were near-diploid, mostly with several numerical and structural aberrations. There were multiple imbalances, with loss of segments from 1p, 3p, 3q, 9p, and chromosome 10 seen in two to four of the seven cases. No clustering of breakpoints was seen and no recurrent recombination between chromosomes was detected. The findings are consistent with previous data and indicate that chordoma tumor development is associated with multiple, nonrandom losses including chromosome segments that are frequently involved in many other solid tumors.</str>

At the patient's request, he underwent a simple endonasal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. A second debulking procedure was planned to debulk the remnant tumor.

      <str>Immunohistochemical properties were studied in 16 lesions from 11 patients with chordoma involving the skin. There were nine men and two women ranging from 21 to 62 years old (mean, 42.6). The initial tumor was sacrococcygeal in 10 cases and nasopharyngeal in 1 case. Three lesions represented a direct extension from the primary tumor to the skin, and 13 lesions were examples of local recurrences in the skin. Immunohistochemically, all lesions showed positivity for keratin, whereas 14 lesions were positive for vimentin and 12 for protein S-100. Epithelial membrane antigen was positive in four instances and carcinoembryonic antigen was negative in all studies. No significant difference was observed between the immunoprofile of cases of direct extension and those of local recurrences. Overall, the remarkable triple positivity for keratin, vimentin, and protein S-100 was observed in 11 lesions from eight different cases (73%). This study confirmed the utility of immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of chordoma from tumors with similar histologic characteristics encountered in the skin.</str>

      <str>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared to computed tomography (CT) in four cases of sacrococcygeal chordoma. Both techniques yielded important anatomic information and represented important advances over early radiologic imaging methods. MRI provides superior contrast with surrounding soft tissues because of the prolonged T1 and T2 times of the tumors. This was especially important in a case of recurrent chordoma. The direct sagittal images obtained by MRI were valuable in determining the extent of lesions. Either MRI or direct CT coronal images were needed for the demonstration of tumor involving the sacral nerve roots. It was not possible to reliably distinguish between tumor adherent to bowel wall and bowel wall invasion by either technique. It is concluded that MRI is at least equal to CT for demonstration of these lesions and seems likely to become the imaging method of choice.</str>

      <str>A huge tumor mass arising from the soft tissue of the nape of the neck, which histologically resembled chordoma is reported. This case had a history of over 30 years after onset at around 37 years of age. With frequent recurrence and re-excision after en bloc radical resection, performed at 47 years of age, this female patient expired at the age of 66, 20 years after the first radical operation. At operation, the mass was found to be firmly attached to the dorsal soft tissue. There was no connection with any bony structure, such as the cervical vertebrae or skull. Chordoma-like histological features were unchanged throughout the next 20 years. This unusual malignant neoplasm appears to correspond to the "chordoid tumor" or "chordoid sarcoma" of soft tissue, a term coined by F.W. Stewart in 1948. Alternatively the name "chondroid chordoma" used by Heffelfinger, Dahlin and others may be employed.</str>

Diagnosis was often delayed due to predominantly nonspecific low back symptoms; however, neurological involvement is more frequent than in chordoma with a sacrococcygeal localization. No pathognomonic images have been described for any imaging modality, and differential diagnosis should include metastases, chondrosarcoma, and giant-cell tumor. Histopathological analysis can be performed on CT-guided puncture biopsy samples, but a high level of suspicion must be present and, if there is any doubt, immunohistochemical studies should be carried out. Despite being the treatment of choice, complete tumor resection by a double-approach spondylectomy is barely feasible at the L2 level.</str>

Eleven patients were over 50 years old and presented with long-standing back pain. All were examined with conventional radiographs; three cases also had CT examinations. In thirteen patients, the tumor originated in the vertebral body and, in one patient, in the posterior element of a vertebra. In nine (64%) of the 14 cases, osteosclerosis was a prominent feature. In the remaining five cases (36%), the bone lesion was purely osteolytic. Involvement of the intervertebral disk was found in three patients; in two of these the tumor extended to an adjacent vertebra. In nine patients, a soft-tissue mass was a distinctive additional feature. A sclerotic and/or osteolytic lesion in a vertebral body with a large, paraspinal soft-tissue mass in an older patient with long-standing back pain should raise the possibility of a chordoma.</str>

A history of prior trauma can be found in about 20 percent of patients, but no clear etiologic relation can be proved. The evidence for a congenital origin from displaced notochordal tissue is equally inconclusive. Metastasis occurs in only about 10 percent of patients, but recurrence of the primary lesion is almost universal. Of 67 patients followed, 11 survived 10 years or longer after diagnosis of chordoma. Resection of the tumor rarely is complete. Preservation of sacral stability and of sacral nerve pathways to the rectum and the bladder limit the extent of permissable surgery. Repeated local excision of the tumor recurring after initial excision and irradiation remains the treatment of choice.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare vertebral tumor that develops from the chorda. The high malignant potential of this tumor, which is associated with a poor life prognosis, has been recognized particularly in the case of tumors originating at the mobile spine. In recent years, en bloc resections of such tumors and an increasing emphasis on a complete local cure have resulted in a certain degree of improvement in the prognosis. This case concerns a 61-year-old male with an L2 chordoma on whom en bloc spondylectomy was performed using a combined anterolateral retroperitoneal, and posterior approach. During the follow-up period, since the transplanted bone was fractured and the rod was broken, a reoperation was performed. Although the surgical margin became intralesional, a favorable course without any metastasis or recurrence during a 10-year postoperative follow-up has been observed. The presenting symptoms, imaging studies, and related literature are reviewed in this report. Thus, the method used in this case may also be considered potentially effective in achieving a radical cure in advanced cases with a local recurrence.</str>

Chordoma is a rare tumor, arising from remnants of the notochord and is locally progressive. Both tumor resection and diverting colostomy were performed at another hospital. In that operation his spinal cord was protected down to the second sacral level. Unfortunately after the operation, the patient suffered total urinary incontinence.

CT scan showed a massive intracerebellar hemorrhage and isodense mass in the sphenoid sinus, which were not enhanced by contrast medium. She became comatose and died 3 days later. No operation was performed. Autopsy revealed massive hemorrhage in the posterior fossa and yellowish, gelatinous tumor extending from the right clivus to the sphenoid sinus. Histological examination showed a chordoma. This case demonstrates that the hemorrhage associated with brain tumor, especially in posterior fossa, produces a significant sudden elevation of intracranial pressure and leads clinically to a rapid loss of consciousness and death soon after the onset.</str>

      <str>Cervical chordomas are rare, slow-growing, but locally aggressive tumors. Predominantly found in people 50-69 years old, a chordoma arises from remnants of the primitive notochord. It is most often found in the sacrococcygeal or skull base areas. However, it can be found throughout the spine. Because chordomas are slow growing, they may reach considerable size before the patient becomes symptomatic. Surgical resection with a wide margin is the only curative procedure. Usually, because of tumor location and infiltration, this is not possible. Although this type of tumor is generally considered radioresistant, radiation therapy is often prescribed after surgical resection.

Stabilization of disease was achieved repeatedly for variable periods under local radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic therapy with isotretinoin and interferon-alpha, followed by thalidomide. Due to the occurrence of brain and lung metastases 8 years after initial diagnosis, liposomal doxorubicin was added to thalidomide. At the last follow-up control the patient had stable disease, with no progression of the intracranial tumor and regression of pulmonary metastases.

      <str>The basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins Myc, Mad and Mnt are part of a transcription activation/repression system involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. The function of these proteins as transcription factors is mediated by heterodimerization with the small bHLHZip protein Max, which is required for their specific DNA binding to E-box sequences. We have identified a novel Max-interacting protein, Mga, which contains a Myc-like bHLHZip motif, but otherwise shows no relationship with Myc or other Max-interacting proteins. Like Myc, Mad and Mnt proteins, Mga requires heterodimerization with Max for binding to the preferred Myc-Max-binding site CACGTG. In addition to the bHLHZip domain, Mga contains a second DNA-binding domain: the T-box or T-domain. The T-domain is a highly conserved DNA-binding motif originally defined in Brachyury and characteristic of the Tbx family of transcription factors. Mga binds the preferred Brachyury-binding sequence and represses transcription of reporter genes containing promoter-proximal Brachyury-binding sites. Surprisingly, Mga is converted to a transcription activator of both Myc-Max and Brachyury site-containing reporters in a Max-dependent manner. Our results suggest that Mga functions as a dual-specificity transcription factor that regulates the expression of both Max-network and T-box family target genes.</str>

      <str>General mechanisms initiating the gastrulation process in early animal development are still elusive, not least because embryonic morphology differs widely among species. The rabbit embryo is revived here as a model to study vertebrate gastrulation, because its relatively simple morphology at the appropriate stages makes interspecific differences and similarities particularly obvious between mammals and birds. Three approaches that centre on mesoderm specification as a key event at the start of gastrulation were chosen. (1) A cDNA fragment encoding 212 amino acids of the rabbit Brachyury gene was cloned by RT-PCR and used as a molecular marker for mesoderm progenitors. Whole-mount in situ hybridisation revealed single Brachyury-expressing cells in the epiblast at 6.2 days post conception, i.e. several hours before the first ingressing mesoderm cells can be detected histologically. With the anterior marginal crescent as a landmark, these mesoderm progenitors are shown to lie in a posterior quadrant of the embryonic disc, which we call the posterior gastrula extension (PGE), for reasons established during the following functional analysis. (2) Vital dye (DiI) labelling in vitro suggests that epiblast cells arrive in the PGE from anterior parts of the embryonic disc and then move within this area in a complex pattern of posterior, centripetal and anterior directions to form the primitive streak. (3) BrdU labelling shows that proliferation is reduced in the PGE, while the remaining anterior part of the embryonic disc contains several areas of increased proliferation. These results reveal similarities with the chick with respect to Brachyury expression and cellular migration. They differ, however, in that local differences in proliferation are not seen in the pre-streak avian embryo. Rather, rabbit epiblast cells start mesoderm differentiation in a way similar to Drosophila, where a transient downregulation of proliferation initiates mesoderm differentiation and, hence, gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Transcription factor Oct4 is expressed in pluripotent cell lineages during mouse development, namely, in inner cell mass (ICM), primitive ectoderm, and primordial germ cells. Functional studies have revealed that Oct4 is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in inner cell mass and for the survival of primordial germ cells. However, the function of Oct4 in the primitive ectoderm has not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the role of Oct4 in mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which exhibit molecular and developmental properties similar to the primitive ectoderm, as an in vitro model. Knockdown of Oct4 in P19 EC cells upregulated several early mesoderm-specific genes, such as Wnt3, Sp5, and Fgf8, by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Overexpression of Oct4 was sufficient to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling through its action as a transcriptional activator. However, Brachyury, a key regulator of early mesoderm development and a known direct target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, was unable to be upregulated in the absence of Oct4, even with additional activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Microarray analysis revealed that Oct4 positively regulated the expression of Tdgf1, a critical component of Nodal signaling, which was required for the upregulation of Brachyury in response to Wnt/β-catenin signaling in P19 EC cells. We propose a model that Oct4 maintains pluripotency of P19 EC cells through 2 counteracting actions: one is to suppress mesoderm-inducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the other is to provide competence to Brachyury gene to respond to Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</str>

      <str>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a primary responder to vascular endothelial growth factor signal and thereby regulates endothelial migration and proliferation. This receptor is expressed in endothelial cells and in some vascular tumors, but many reports also detail its expression in carcinomas and lymphomas. VEGFR2 is a potential cell-type marker, and data on VEGFR2 expression may also have therapeutic significance in view of recent availability of VEGFR2 inhibitors. In this study, we immunohistochemically examined 262 vascular endothelial and 1640 nonvascular tumors and selected non-neoplastic tissues with a VEGFR2-specific rabbit monoclonal antibody 55B11. In early human embryo, VEFGR2 was expressed in endothelia of developing capillaries and in the thoracic duct, great vessels, hepatic sinusoids, epidermis, and mesothelia. In late first trimester fetus peripheral soft tissues, VEGFR2 was restricted to capillary endothelia, chondrocytes, and superficial portion of the epidermis. In normal adult tissues, it was restricted to endothelia and mesothelia. VEGFR2 was consistently expressed in angiosarcomas, Kaposi sarcomas, and retiform hemangioendotheliomas. It was detected in only half of epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (15/27), usually focally. VEGFR2 was strongly expressed in most capillary hemangiomas and weakly or focally in cavernous, venous, and spindle cell hemangiomas and in lymphangiomas. Malignant epithelial mesothelioma was found to be a unique epithelial neoplasm with a strong and nearly consistent VEGFR2 expression, including membrane staining (35/38). Approximately 10% of squamous cell carcinomas and 23% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas contained focal positivity. The only nonendothelial mesenchymal tumors found to be VEGFR2 positive were biphasic synovial sarcoma (focal epithelial expression) and chordoma. All melanomas and lymphomas were negative. VEGFR2 is a promising marker for malignant vascular tumors and malignant epithelioid mesothelioma. Expression in biphasic synovial sarcoma epithelium, chordoma, and some carcinomas has to be considered in differential diagnosis. Information on VEGFR2 tissue expression may be useful in development of targeted oncologic therapy through VEGFR2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</str>

      <str>A 67-year-old woman presented for evaluation of severe coccygeal pain. The computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging showed an asymmetric midline sacral tumor invading the right lower portion of S2. To preserve both S2 nerve roots and to obtain negative surgical margins, a modified mid-sacrectomy with an aid of a computed navigation system was performed. The sacral tumor was excised en bloc with negative tumor margins. Both S2 nerve roots were preserved and additional reconstruction was not necessary because of minimal resection of the sacroiliac joint. We report a case of a sacral chordoma which was excised en bloc with adequate surgical margins by a computer-assisted modified mid-sacrectomy. The computed navigation system may be a useful tool for tumor targeting and safe osteotomies in sacral tumor surgery via the posterior only approach.</str>

      <str>As a manifestation of their inherent plasticity, carcinoma cells undergo profound phenotypic changes during progression toward metastasis. One such phenotypic modulation is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an embryonically relevant process that can be reinstated by tumor cells, resulting in the acquisition of metastatic propensity, stem-like cell properties, and resistance to a variety of anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation, and some small-molecule targeted therapies. Targeting of the EMT is emerging as a novel intervention against tumor progression. This review focuses on the potential use of cancer vaccine strategies targeting tumor cells that exhibit mesenchymal-like features, with an emphasis on the current status of development of vaccine platforms directed against the T-box transcription factor brachyury, a novel cancer target involved in tumor EMT, stemness, and resistance to therapies. Also presented is a summary of potential mechanisms of resistance to immune-mediated attack driven by EMT and the development of novel combinatorial strategies based on the use of agents that alleviate tumor EMT for an optimized targeting of plastic tumor cells that are responsible for tumor recurrence and the establishment of therapeutic refractoriness. </str>

      <str>Retrospective case series.</str>
      <str>To evaluate the risk of infection, related treatment, and outcome after surgery of the 2 most common primary sacral tumors.</str>
      <str>Rarity of sacral tumors has limited the number of population-based studies. Treatment depends on malignancy or local aggressiveness: wide resection is indicated for malignant lesions, intralesional surgery for benign.</str>
      <str>We studied 82 patients with sacral chordomas (55 cases) or giant cell tumor (GCT) (27 cases) treated between 1976 and 2005. All patients had IV antibiotic therapy with amikacin and teicoplanin. Surgery of chordoma was resection; surgery of GCT was intralesional excision. Infections were classified as immediate postoperative, early (within 6 months), and late (more than 6 months from surgery). Mean follow-up was 9.5 years (range: 3-27 years). Some factors possibly influencing the risk of infection were statistically analyzed by Kaplan Meier curves and log-rank test.</str>
      <str>No deep infections were observed in the GCT series. Three patients with sacral chordoma died for postoperative complications and were excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining 52 patients with chordoma, 23/52 had deep wound infection (44%) that required 1 or more surgical debridements combined with antibiotics, according to cultures. In 16 patients (70%), infection occurred within 4 weeks postoperatively, and in 7 within 6 months. Most frequent bacteria were Enterococcus (23%), Escherichia coli (20%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%). In 74% of cases, infection was multimicrobial. Level of resection, previous intralesional treatment elsewhere, tumor volume, and age did not statistically influence risk of infection.</str>
      <str>Type of surgery was the prominent factor related to a major risk of infection. Operating procedure time correlated as well. Resections of sacral chordoma imply a high risk of deep infection, while intralesional excision of GCT does not. All infections healed with surgical debridements and antibiotic therapy.</str>

      <str>Ten patients undergoing sacrectomy for histologically confirmed dedifferentiated chordoma at a specialist center were reviewed. There were 6 male and 4 female patients with a mean age of 66.7 years (range, 57-80 years) and mean follow-up of 36.7 months (range, 3-98 months). Data on prognostic factors were collected.</str>
      <str>The commonest presenting symptom was lumbar/gluteal pain. Mean duration of preoperative symptoms was 3.6 months (range, 2-7 months). Local recurrence was seen in 7 patients; metastases occurred in 5 patients. After sacrectomy, 7 patients died at a mean of 41 months (range, 3-98 months). Tumor size &gt;10 cm in diameter, amount of dedifferentiation within the conventional chordoma, sacroiliac joint infiltration, and inadequate resection margins were associated with increased risk of recurrence and reduced survival. Surgical approach, cephalad extent of primary tumor, and adjuvant radiotherapy did not affect oncological outcomes.</str>
      <str>Dedifferentiated chordomas are aggressive malignant tumors with a higher risk of local recurrence, metastases, and early mortality than conventional chordomas. Tumor diameter &gt;10 cm, marginal resection, and sacroiliac joint infiltration may be associated with increased risk of local recurrence and mortality. Those with a smaller burden of dedifferentiated disease (&lt;1 cm) within the primary chordoma have a better prognosis. Patients should be counseled about these risks before surgery and should have regular follow-up for the detection of local recurrence and metastases.</str>

      <str>Local recurrence after resection of sacral chordoma is a challenging problem for the orthopedic oncologists. That is why analysis of its margins of safety is of outmost importance.</str>
      <str>Eighteen cases of sacral chordoma were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients were followed for determination of their status clinically and radiographically. The surgical margins for every resected tumor were evaluated proximally, ventrally, and at the postero-lateral aspect of the sacrum.</str>
      <str>Ventrally, the surgical margins were seven marginal and ten wide margins. Proximally, there were three marginal, nine wide and five curative margins. Postero-laterally, there were one intra-lesional, one marginal, 12 wide and three curative margins. Local recurrence encountered postero-laterally in six cases with five wide and one intra-lesional margin. On the other hand, no local recurrence was disclosed ventrally or proximally despite marginal resections were employed to the ventral resection in seven and proximally in three cases. With a mean follow-up of 11 years, six patients died of their disease, and 12 patients were alive. The 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates were 81, 70, and 33%, respectively.</str>
      <str>The appropriate surgical margin for complete removal of the chordoma differs according to the location of the tumor and tissues involved. Marginal margin ventrally and wide margin proximally are sufficient while postero-laterally including the gluteus maximus muscles a curative or radical margin seems to be the appropriate surgical margin to prevent tumor recurrence.</str>

      <str>To evaluate postoperative spot-scanning proton radiation therapy (PT) and intensity-modulated PT (IMPT) for chordoma and chondrosarcoma in pediatric patients.</str>
      <str>Between 2000 and 2005, 10 patients (six male patients, four female patients; six chordomas, four chondrosarcomas), aged 10-20 years (median, 16 years), were treated at our institute. Tumor sites were in the brain (one case), skull base (five cases), cervical (three cases), and lumbar spine (one case). Three children had complete resections. In seven children, resection was incomplete, leaving residual tumor behind (range, 2.3-46.3 mL). PT was delivered using spot scanning, with (three patients) or without (seven patients) IMPT. Total dose was 74.0 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) for chordoma, and 63.2-68.0 CGE for chondrosarcoma (median, 66.0), depending on histopathological grading and whether the patient had concurrent chemotherapy.</str>
      <str>Median follow-up time was 36 months (range, 8-77 months). Radiation treatment was well tolerated. All patients remained failure-free at their last follow-up.

      <str>Chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the central nervous system share many histological features, generating, at times, considerable diagnostic difficulty and, not infrequently, requiring immunohistochemical analysis for appropriate classification. While both chordomas and chondrosarcomas stain positively for S100, only chordomas typically express epithelial antigens like cytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen. Positive or negative staining with these latter two markers currently represents the only immunohistochemical technique that effectively distinguishes chordomas from chondrosarcomas. A marker that is reliably positive in chondrosarcomas and negative in chordomas has, to date, not been reported. D2-40 is a monoclonal antibody initially developed against M2A, a fetal testis-related antigen now known as podoplanin (aggrus), which has been found to stain a diverse collection of both benign and malignant tissues. In this study, we systematically investigated D2-40 immunoreactivity in a series of 22 chordomas, 20 chondrosarcomas, and 12 enchondromas, in conjunction with cytokeratin and S100 immunostaining. We found that D2-40 robustly and reliably immunostains low-grade chondroid neoplasms (100% of enchondromas and 94% of grades I and II chondrosarcomas), but not chordomas. By contrast, we observed generally strong and diffuse cytokeratin positivity in all cases of chordoma, but not in cases of enchondroma or low-grade chondrosarcoma. Thus, we show that D2-40 behaves as a chondroid marker differentiating true chondroid neoplasms from chordoma. We also demonstrate D2-40 immunoreactivity in two cases of chordoid meningioma and, in doing so, tentatively provide a means to distinguish this tumor from chordoma.</str>

      <str>The studies described here sought to identify and characterize genes involved in the gastrulation and morphogenetic movements that occur during sea urchin embryogenesis. An orthologue of the T-box family transcription factor, Brachyury, was cloned through a candidate gene approach. Brachyury (T) is the founding member of this T-box transcription factor family and has been implicated in gastrulation movements in Xenopus, zebrafish, and mouse embryogenesis. Polyclonal serum was generated to LvBrac in order to characterize protein expression. LvBrac initially appears at mesenchyme blastula stage in two distinct regions with embryonic expression perduring until pluteus stage. Vegetally, LvBrac expression is in endoderm and lies circumferentially around the blastopore. This torus-shaped area of LvBrac expression remains constant in size as endoderm cells express LvBrac upon moving into that circumference and cease LvBrac expression as they leave the circumference. Vegetal expression remains around the anus through pluteus stage. The second domain of LvBrac expression first appears broadly in the oral ectoderm at mesenchyme blastula stage and at later embryonic stages is refined to just the stomodael opening. Vegetal LvBrac expression depends on autonomous beta-catenin signaling in macromeres and does not require micromere or veg2-inductive signals. It was then determined that LvBrac is necessary for the morphogenetic movements occurring in both expression regions. A dominant-interfering construct was generated by fusing the DNA binding domain of LvBrac to the transcriptional repression module of the Drosophila Engrailed gene in order to perturb gene function. Microinjection of mRNA encoding this LvBrac-EN construct resulted in a block in gastrulation movements but not expression of endoderm and mesoderm marker genes. Furthermore, injection of LvBrac-EN into one of two blastomeres resulted in normal gastrulation movements of tissues derived from the injected blastomere, indicating that LvBrac downstream function may be nonautonomous during sea urchin gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Intervertebral disc (IVD) disorder and age-related degeneration are believed to contribute to low back pain. Cell-based therapies represent a promising strategy to treat disc degeneration; however, the cellular and molecular characteristics of disc cells during IVD maturation and aging still remain poorly defined. This study investigated novel molecular markers and their age-related changes in the rat IVD. Affymetrix cDNA microarray analysis was conducted to identify a new set of genes characterizing immature nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Among these markers, select neuronal-related proteins (Basp1, Ncdn and Nrp-1), transcriptional factor (Brachyury T), and cell surface receptors (CD24, CD90, CD155 and CD221) were confirmed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for differential expression between IVD tissue regions and among various ages (1, 12 and 21 months). NP cells generally possessed higher levels of mRNA or protein expression for all aforementioned markers, with the exception of CD90 in anulus fibrosus (AF) cells. In addition, CD protein (CD24 and CD90) and Brachyury (T) expression in immature disc cells were also confirmed via flow cytometry. Similar to IHC staining, results revealed a higher percentage of immature NP cells expressing CD24 and Brachyury, while higher percentage of immature AF cells was stained positively for CD90. Altogether, this study identifies that tissue-specific gene expression and age-related differential expression of the above markers do exist in immature and aged disc cells. These age-related phenotype changes provide a new insight for a molecular profile that may be used to characterize NP cells for developing cell-based regenerative therapy for IVD regeneration.</str>

      <str>Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) plays a key role in mesoderm formation during early development. One factor thought to be involved in the regulation of Xbra is XSIP1, a zinc finger/homeodomain-like DNA-binding protein that belongs to the deltaEF1 family of transcriptional repressors. We show here that Xbra and XSIP1 are co-expressed at the onset of gastrulation, but that expression subsequently refines such that Xbra is expressed in prospective mesoderm and XSIP1 in anterior neurectoderm. This refinement of the expression patterns of the two genes is due in part to the ability of XSIP1 to repress expression of Xbra. This repression is highly specific, in the sense that XSIP1 does not repress the expression of other regionally expressed genes in the early embryo, and that other members of the family to which XSIP1 belongs, such as deltaEF1 and its Xenopus homologue ZEB, cannot regulate Xbra expression. The function of XSIP1 was studied further by making an interfering construct comprising the open reading frame of XSIP1 fused to the VP16 transactivation domain. Experiments using this chimeric protein suggest that XSIP1 is required for normal gastrulation movements to occur and for the development of the anterior neural plate.</str>

      <str>We have used a functional assay to identify a putative T-box transcription factor (Xombi) that has the ability to induce sites of invagination in the ectoderm of Xenopus embryos that resemble the blastopore lip. Maternal Xombi transcript is first localized to the oocyte's vegetal cortex and cytoplasm, early sources of mesoderm and endoderm-inducing signals. Soon after zygotic transcription begins, there is a wave of Xombi expression, beginning in dorsal mesoderm and then extending to lateral and ventral mesoderm, that precedes and parallels blastopore lip formation at the border between the mesoderm and endoderm. Transcripts encoding brachyury, Xwnt8 and goosecoid colocalize with Xombi transcripts within the marginal zone; ectopic expression of Xombi induces expression of all three mesodermal genes. In ectodermal explants, Xombi expression is induced by the secreted mesoderm inducers activinA, activinB, Xnrl and eFGF, and by brachyury, another Xenopus T-box containing gene. The time course and location of Xombi expression, its biological activities and the partial dependence of Xombi expression and blastopore lip formation on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling suggest that Xombi contributes to a traveling wave of morphogenesis and differentiation during Xenopus gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Organizer activity, once thought to be restricted to vertebrates, has ancient origins. However, among non-bilaterians, it has only been subjected to detailed investigation during embryonic development of the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. As a step toward establishing the extent to which findings in Nematostella can be generalized across the large and diverse phylum Cnidaria, we examined the expression of some key organizer and gastrulation genes during the embryonic development of the coral Acropora millepora. Although anemones and corals both belong to the cnidarian class Anthozoa, the two lineages diverged during the Cambrian and the morphological development of Acropora differs in several important respects from that of Nematostella. While the expression patterns of the key genes brachyury, bmp2/4, chordin, goosecoid and forkhead are broadly similar, developmental differences between the two species enable novel observations, and new interpretations of their significance. Specifically, brachyury expression during the flattened prawnchip stage before gastrulation, a developmental peculiarity of Acropora, leads us to suggest that it is the key gene demarcating ectoderm from endoderm in Acropora, and by implication in other cnidarians, whereas previous studies in Nematostella proposed that forkhead plays this role. Other novel observations include the transient expression of Acropora forkhead in scattered ectodermal cells shortly after gastrulation, and in the developing mesenterial filaments, with no corresponding expression reported in Nematostella. In addition, the expression patterns of goosecoid and bmp2/4 confirm the fundamental bilaterality of the Anthozoa. </str>

This tumor is often seen in children, but not in adults, with a systemic inflammatory syndrome (iron-resistant microcytic anemia and/or dysgammaglobulinemia) and very rarely with a persistent moderate hyperthermia. In the present report the authors describe a temporal chordoid meningioma in a 30-year-old woman who presented with fever, headache, and a serological inflammatory syndrome. The clinical symptomatology, chiefly the fever, disappeared immediately after removal of the tumor. To the authors' knowledge, only one similar patient with such clinical presentation and response to surgery has been mentioned in the literature. Interestingly, at immunohistochemical examination, the neoplasm showed focal positivity for the pyrogenic cytokine interleukin-6. The capacity of the tumor to produce this pyrogenic cytokine could explain both the patient's clinical presentation and her response to the surgical management.</str>

Computerized tomography scan disclosed destruction of the lower half of the clivus and retropharyngeal tumor predominantly located in the third prevertebral region. The tumor was removed partially via the transcervical approach and was histologically a typical chordoma. Two years later the tumor recurred and was operated on by the same approach. However, only partial removal of the tumor was realized due to difficulties in dissecting the fibrous adhesion. In 1986 (7 years after onset of the symptoms), the patient was readmitted due to severe dysphagia. The sagittal MRI scan demonstrated a huge oval retropharyngeal tumor with precise delineation between the tumor and clivus, clivus upper cervical spine and brain stem. The tumor was extirpated subtotally on the midline via the transoral approach. Dysphagia completely improved postoperatively and the patient regained normal smell sensation.

To understand the function of Cdk2ap2 during early development, we generated mESCs with homozygous disruption of the endogenous Cdk2ap2 locus (Cdk2ap2(tr/tr)). The Cdk2ap2(tr/tr) mESCs, when grown in a complete growth medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), showed an early differentiation phenotype characterized by flattened colonies and a distinct intercellular boundary. We also observed downregulation of Nanog and upregulation in markers of mesoderm and endoderm differentiation, including Brachyury (T), Afp, and S100a, when compared to Wt mESCs. Cdk2ap2(tr/tr) mESCs were able to form embryoid bodies (EBs); however, those EBs were unhealthy and had an increased level of apoptosis. Furthermore, Cdk2ap2(tr/tr) mESCs were unable to form teratomas in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Cdk2ap2 under normal conditions has a biphasic expression, suggesting regulatory roles in early-versus-late stem cell differentiation. These data begin to add to our understanding of how Cdk2ap2 may be involved in the regulation of self-renewal of stem cells during early embryogenesis.</str>

The near-triploid tumor had numerous structural rearrangements, including a der(21)t(2;21)(q11;q22), which involves the same band of chromosome 21 as the translocation in the first tumor. Prophasing was a prominent cytogenetic feature of this tumor.

The sand dollar species shared two expression domains of the Bra orthologs with the Echinoida species, in the vegetal ring (the first domain) and the oral ectoderm (the second domain). The following heterotopic changes in the expression of the Bra genes were found among the sand dollar species and between the sand dollars and the Echinoida species. (1) The vegetal ring expressing Bra in the sand dollars was much wider and was located at a higher position along the AV axis, compared with that in the Echinoida species. The characteristic Bra expression in the vegetal ring of the sand dollar embryos was thought to be involved in the mode of gastrulation, in which involution continues from the beginning of invagination until the end of gastrulation. (2) Two of the three indirect-developing sand dollar species that were examined exhibited a third domain, in which Bra was expressed on the oral side of the archenteron.

      <str>The continued turn over of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) while maintaining an undifferentiated state is dependent on the regulation of the cell cycle. Here we asked the question if a single cell cycle gene could regulate the self-renewal or pluripotency properties of hESC. We identified that the protein expression of the p27(Kip)¹ cell cycle inhibitor is low in hESC cells and increased with differentiation. By adopting a gain and loss of function strategy we forced or reduced its expression in undifferentiating conditions to define its functional role in self-renewal and pluripotency. Using undifferentiation conditions, overexpression of p27(Kip)¹ in hESC lead to a G₁phase arrest with an enlarged and flattened hESC morphology and consequent loss of self-renewal ability. Loss of p27(Kip)¹ caused an elongated/scatter cell-like phenotype involving up-regulation of Brachyury and Twist gene expression. We demonstrate the novel finding that p27(Kip)¹ protein occupies the Twist1 gene promoter and manipulation of p27(Kip)¹ by gain and loss of function is associated with Twist gene expression changes. These results define p27(Kip)¹ expression levels as critical for self-renewal and pluripotency in hESC and suggest a role for p27(Kip)¹ in controlling an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hESC.</str>

      <str>Bilateria are subdivided into Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Indirect development through primary, ciliary larvae occurs in both of these branches; however, the closing blastopore develops into mouth and anus in Protostomia and into anus only in Deuterostomia. Because of this important difference in larval gut ontogeny, the tube-shaped guts in protostome and deuterostome primary larvae are thought to have evolved independently. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed the expression of brachyury, otx and goosecoid homologues in the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii, which develops by means of a trochophora larva-the primary, ciliary larva prototypic for Protostomia. Here we show that brachyury expression in the ventral portion of the developing foregut in Platynereis and also otx expression along ciliated bands in the mouth region of the trochophora larva parallels expression in primary larvae in Deuterostomia. In addition, goosecoid expression in the foregut of Platynereis mirrors the function in higher Deuterostomia. We present molecular evidence for the evolutionary conservation of larval foreguts and mouth regions of Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Our data indicate that Urbilateria, the common bilaterian ancestors, developed through a primary, ciliary larva that already possessed a tripartite tube-shaped gut.</str>

We report a case of sacrococcygeal chordoma successfully treated by high sacral resection by a posterior approach, in which the co-operative efforts of gastroenterological surgeons and an orthopedic surgeon were employed. A 64-year-old man with a long term continued vague anal pain was referred to our hospital. Digital rectal examination revealed an elastic hard mass presacrally. Plain sagittal radiograph, CT, barium enema showed a retrorectal mass and sacral destruction. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically by the specimen taken by open biopsy. Surgical resection was carried out in prone position with the buttocks elevated. The skin incision was upward arched transverse. The lower sacral vertebrae, including S3, were removed en block with the tumor. Bilateral S3 sacral nerve roots were preserved. Postoperative disturbances of the urination and defecation were not seen. High dose radiation therapy, 80 Gray, was done after surgery. Radiation ulcer of the skin was treated by free skin graft, but radiation proctocolitis was not seen. Now he is free from the disease.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate that an en bloc resection with negative surgical margins can be successfully achieved in a case of a seemingly unresectable C-2 chordoma if appropriate preoperative staging and planning are performed. The management of chordomas is controversial and challenging because of their location and often large size at presentation. Because chordomas are malignant and will aggressively recur locally if intralesional resection is conducted, wide or true en bloc resection is generally recommended. The literature indicates, however, that surgeons are reluctant to perform wide or even marginal resections because of the lesion's complex surrounding anatomy and the risk of significant neurological compromise when a tumor abuts the dura mater or neural tissues. In this report the authors outline the successful en bloc resection of a large C1-3 chordoma and discuss the importance of preoperative staging and planning.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing but locally aggressive malignant tumor derived from the primitive notochord and located along the axial skeleton. Between 1973 and 1991, of 15 patients with chordomas treated at the Medical College of Virginia, eight originated in the sacrococcygeal area. There was a median one year interval between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis (range of four months to six years) for this latter group. Two patients had undergone coccygectomies and one patient a lumbar discectomy prior to establishing the correct diagnosis of sacral chordoma. Seven patients underwent resection and one refused therapy. The four patients who had an initial wide radical resection had a longer disease-free survival than the three who underwent local excision. Three of four patients had metastatic disease at the time of death. Early diagnosis and aggressive initial surgical resection are necessary for long-term survival.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is known to be the most common primary tumor of the sacrum. Its surgery is challenging from many aspects. A large amount of bleeding is one of the biggest issues. A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with a huge mass at sacrum. The mass was diagnosed as chordoma after a needle biopsy. Prior to the surgery, a balloon dilation catheter (BDC) was placed in the distal abdominal aorta via the femoral artery. Just after the skin incision, the BDC was inflated with contrast medium and total occlusion of the aorta was achieved. At the end of the operation we observed that total hemorrhage had decreased dramatically. No complications were recorded except hypertension during the occlusion of the aorta which was expected. The patient was discharged after two weeks of hospitalization post-operatively without any neurological deficit. Our report is the second in the neurosurgical literature to our knowledge. Although this result is preliminary and needs to be replicated and expanded upon, our first experience with this method is effective for decreasing the amount of bleeding. We believe that our method prevents hemo-dynamical problems caused by massive bleeding and complications secondary to massive transfusion.</str>

      <str>To review developments in chordoma treatment.</str>
      <str>Recent series with prolonged follow-up show that adequate margins are necessary for surgery to be curative. Safe margins are often difficult to obtain due to the anatomical sites of chordoma: sacrum, skull base and spine. Tumors in these sites are problematic for radiation therapy as well, and this adds to the need for high doses. Hadrons have therefore been used in addition to, or instead of, photons. New photon beam techniques, e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy and stereotactic procedures, have recently been evaluated. Although less available than photons, hadrons possess certain advantages. While chemotherapy is poorly active, recent interest has focused on molecular-targeted agents. Imatinib was shown to be active, providing mainly nondimensional tissue responses in a significant proportion of patients, which may improve symptoms and progression-free interval. Epidermal growth factor receptor targeting, anti-angiogenics, and the combination of targeted agents with chemotherapy and radiation therapy are also under scrutiny.</str>
      <str>Two major issues about local treatment remain unresolved: when to complement surgery with radiation therapy, and how best to deliver high doses of radiation therapy to the tumor tissue. Regarding systemic treatment, there is ongoing research into how to exploit molecular-targeted therapies.</str>

      <str>Sacral chordomas are relatively rare, locally invasive, malignant neoplasms. Although metastasis is infrequent at presentation, the prognosis for patients with chordoma of the sacrum is reported to be poor and attributable in most cases to intralesional resection. The value of adjuvant treatment is uncertain, and resection remains the primary mode of treatment. Chordomas are difficult to excise completely, but recent improvements in imaging and surgical techniques have allowed surgeons to perform more frequently en bloc sacral resections with wide surgical margins. The technical challenges of such operations, and the functional costs for the patient (with respect to anorectal and urogenital dysfunction) are significantly increased when the tumor involves high sacral levels. The authors review the clinical presentation and natural history of sacral chordoma and discuss the current treatment techniques and outcomes.</str>

He consulted his family physician and was referred by him to a general surgeon with the diagnosis of pilonidal disease. During the operation, the surgeon found an unusual mass and performed a wedge biopsy of the tumor. When chordoma was returned as the diagnosis, the patient was referred to our tertiary hospital for further treatment. The sacrococcygeal chordoma was excised en bloc with the coccyx and the fifth sacral vertebra by posterior approach.</str>

Total excision of the mass was done and all symptoms were relieved. The light microscopic examination revealed a chordoma. The ultrastructural study was performed with particular interest in physaliferous cells. The fine structure disclosed the prominent associations of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mitochondria showed irregularities in sizes and shapes but did not attenuate as much as previously reported. The vacuoles that were observed by light microscopy in physaliferous cells were both extra-cellular and intra-cellular and contained finely granular material of acid mucopolysaccharides probably of chondroitin type. The presence of both subplasmalemmal linear densities (SLD) and pinocytic vesicles was consistent with the histogenetic conviction that the tumor arose from mesodermal derivatives.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are relatively rare dysontogenetic tumors developing from the remnants of the spinal chord. Intracranial chordomas consist of 85% of all chordomas. Slowly progressive growth with destructive osteolysis in adjacent bones and low metastatic potential are specific for chordomas. Ninety six surgeries were performed in 71 patients with chordomas at the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery from 1987 to 1996. This article presents a clinical case of large clival chordoma with extra-intracranial growth in a 58 year-old female patient. The clinical picture is characterized by lesions in the caudal cranial nerves, predominantly on the right side, as well as cerebellar and brainstem signs and symptoms. Two-stage partial removal of malignant clival chordoma was performed via transoral and retrosigmoid approaches. The interval between the stages was 6 months. In the authors' opinion, multistage surgery is preferred in the treatment of giant clival chordomas. Partial removal should be started from the portions of a tumor producing the most prominent neurological signs. This method allows the patient's status to be temporarily improved.</str>

      <str>Chordomas of the clivus are frequently denoted as malignant, mainly because of their propensity to recur, their crucial location and the fatal clinical course. Although microscopical examination commonly reveals pleomorphism, particularly of cells and nuclei, the histological assessment of malignancy is not always appropriate. The measurement of DNA could provide important information for a classification of their biological behavior (grading). Our examination of a chondroid chordoma revealed a typical diploid DNA curve within a "benign" 4C range concordant to the favorable course of this variant. Our second examination of a "typical" chordoma showed a wide pleomorphism of cell nuclei and moderate proliferation activity within a "low grade" scale. This pointed to a coming (fatal) recurrence 3.5 years after the first surgery. The third chordoma we examined presented an extraordinary 4C aneuploidy with hypertetraploid subpopulations and an increased number of bi- or poly-nucleated tumor cells with prominent nucleoli and some more mitotic figures. In 5 recurrences the DNA pattern remained principally unchanged.</str>

      <str>Chordomas located primarily in the sellar region are uncommon, and may be misdiagnosed non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Furthermore, the association of a persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) with an intrasellar chordoma is extremely rare, and no similar cases have been reported in the literature to date. The coexistence of intrasellar chordoma (ISC) and PPTA makes safe and complete tumor resection challenging, and preoperative endovascular occlusion of this artery may be helpful. We report a case of a 32-year-old man who developed right hemifacial paresthesias and a cranial nerve six palsy. MRI study demonstrated the presence of a primary ISC associated with a PPTA. Angiographic balloon test occlusion of the PPTA revealed no neurological changes, so this vessel was endovascularly occluded by coiling. The lesion was subtotally removed through a sublabial transsphenoidal approach, without intraoperative bleeding complications. Histological examination of the lesion was consistent with the diagnosis of chordoma. Detailed preoperative neurovascular evaluation may be useful to detect vascular anomalies associated with intracranial chordomas, such as PPTA. In this report we emphasize the importance of appropriate treatment of vascular anomalies prior intrasellar lesions resection that may facilitate surgery and avoid potential hazardous intraoperative bleeding complications.</str>

One patient had local progression of disease, which was treated with surgery and radiation therapy. All patients are clinically free of disease 11 to 26 months following the most recent treatment.

There were 31 males and 42 females ranging from 1 to 18 (mean 9.7) years. Forty-two cases (58%) were conventional chordomas, some of which had unusual histopathologic features. Chondroid chordomas comprised 23% of cases. Fourteen tumors (19%) were highly cellular and had a solid growth pattern with no myxoid matrix or lobular architecture. Eight of these had cytologic features of conventional chordoma cells including physaliferous cells (cellular chordoma). The remaining cellular tumors were composed of poorly differentiated epithelioid cells set in a fibrous stroma and lacked physaliferous cells (poorly differentiated chordoma). All variants studied by immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein, and vimentin. Mitoses and necrosis were seen in all variants. Follow-up data were available for all patients and ranged from 1 to 21 (mean 7.25) years. The survival rate was 81%. All but 1 patient with poorly differentiated chordoma died of disease. Overall, base of skull chordomas in children and adolescents treated with proton beam radiation have better survival than chordomas in adults.

      <str>The authors studied four chordomas with malignant spindle cell components (SCs) and 12 conventional chordomas (CCs) by DNA flow cytometry using paraffin-embedded tissue. In addition, immunohistochemical stains for a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were performed. The four SCs contained areas histologically identical to conventional chordomas, as well as a high-grade malignant spindle cell component. All four (100%) SCs had an aneuploid-multiploid DNA content. Of interest, the conventional chordoma areas in these tumors had DNA contents different from those containing the high-grade malignant spindle cells. In contrast, only three (27%) of the 11 conventional chordomas with analyzable histograms had an aneuploid-multiploid DNA content. Immunohistochemical studies performed on the four SCs showed the high-grade malignant spindle cells to stain strongly for vimentin and weakly for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), whereas the areas of conventional chordoma in these same neoplasms stained moderately for vimentin and S-100 protein, and strongly for cytokeratin and EMA. In two cases, the staining for EMA and cytokeratin highlighted a gradual transition between the areas of conventional chordoma and the spindle cell areas. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of the 12 conventional chordomas was similar to that seen in the conventional chordoma components of the four chordomas with malignant spindle cell components. These results suggest that: 1) aneuploidy is more common in SCs than in CCs, and 2) some SCs are multipotential neoplasms in which the neoplastic cells are capable of differentiation along both epithelial and mesenchymal pathways.</str>

      <str>The cytologic findings in a series of 17 patients with chordoma (one clivus, three cervical, one lumbar, and 12 sacral tumors), all of whom underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in the preoperative investigation, were studied. Cytologically, three main cell types were recognized: large, mononucleated or binucleated physaliferous cells with a vacuolated "bubbly" cytoplasm; small, rounded, uniform cells; and short spindle-shaped cells. The May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining was found superior to Papanicolaou staining in demonstrating the mucoid matrix and the vacuolated cytoplasm of the physaliferous tumor cells. Ultra-structurally, the tumor cells contained prominent bundles of filament of the intermediate type, as well as large vacuoles and lumina often bordered by microvillous projections; the cells were connected to one another by well-developed desmosomes. The resin embedding technique for the light and electron-microscopic examination of FNAB material (eight cases), the histochemical demonstration of sulphated glucosaminoglycans in the matrix (four cases), and the immunocytochemical analysis (four cases) with positivity for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, and S-100 protein and negativity for carcinoembryonic antigen were found to be of value for the cytologic diagnosis of chordoma, and helped in distinguishing it from other chondrogenic tumors and metastatic mucous-producing carcinoma. From this study we conclude that a preoperative diagnosis of chordoma can be reached by FNAB, provided the findings are carefully evaluated in relation to the clinical and roentgenographic findings. Adjunctive histochemical, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural techniques applied on the FNA material may be helpful in reaching a conclusive diagnosis when differential diagnostic problems occur.</str>

      <str>Steroid hormone receptors are involved in the regulation of tumor growth. Two progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms have been identified in humans: a larger form (PR-B) and the N-terminally truncated one (PR-A). PR isoforms can exert opposite functions and are differentially regulated by estrogens. PR have been detected in several brain tumors including chordomas, however, it is unknown which PR isoform is expressed in brain tumors. The aim of this study was to determine by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry the expression pattern of PR isoforms in chordomas as well as its correlation with the expression of estrogen receptor a (ER-alpha). All studied chordomas expressed both PR and ER-alpha. PR-B was the predominant isoform in chordomas both at the mRNA and at the protein level. These data suggest that PR-B should be the predominant PR isoform expressed in human chordomas.</str>

      <str>The murine Brachyury (T) gene is required in posterior mesoderm formation and axial development. Mutant embryos lacking T gene function are deficient in notochord differentiation and posterior mesoderm formation, but make anterior mesoderm. Posterior axial development requires increasing T activity along the rostrocaudal axis. The T gene is transiently transcribed in nascent and migrating mesoderm and continuously in the notochord. The maintenance of T expression in the notochord depends, directly or indirectly, on wild-type T activity. In Xenopus it has been shown that the onset of T expression occurs in response to mesoderm-inducing growth factors. The T protein is binding to DNA and is probably involved in the control of gene expression. Here we show that the T protein is located in the nucleus. We have analyzed the expression pattern of T protein in wild-type and mutant embryos from early primitive streak formation to the end of the tail bud stage. Throughout all stages of mesoderm formation T protein is transiently present in nascent and migrating mesoderm. In the notochord T protein persists to the end of the tail bud stage. It is also transiently detectable in the forming gut endoderm and in prospective neuroectoderm of later embryos. This shows that T expression is not strictly correlated with a commitment of cells to mesoderm. The analysis of the tail development of TWis/+ mutant embryos demonstrated that the formation of the neural tube, gut, and somites from the tail bud proceeds in the absence of a notochord. The maintenance and differentiation of these structures, however, seems to depend on signals from the notochord.</str>

      <str>Because of their extremely simple body plan, dicyemids have long been the subject of phylogenetic controversy, regarding whether their body plan reflects their primitiveness or a degeneration from complex metazoans. Several studies have argued that the simple body plan of dicyemids are likely secondarily derived from higher lophotrochozoan animals, as a result of their endoparasitic, or endosymbiotic, lifestyle in the cephalopod kidney. To clarify the evolution of their simple body plan, we investigated the developmental expression patterns of three important regulatory genes, the central type Hox gene (DoxC), otx, and brachyury homologs in the dicyemid mesozoa, Dicyema orientale. DoxC was expressed in the trunk and tail of the asexually developing vermiform embryo, with clear anterior boundaries. Do-otx was expressed in the vegetal pole cells of the developing infusoriform embryos, suggesting that the invagination in infusoriform embryo is homologous to the gastrulation of other metazoans. Do-bra is expressed in the presumptive ventral cells, which are ventral to the opening of the urn cavity. The expression of Do-bra suggests that the urn cavity opening of the infusoriform embryo is comparable to the stomodium of trochophore larvae. These gene expression patterns provide molecular clues to trace the evolutionary history of degeneration in the dicyemid embryogenesis and life cycle from those of ancestral lophotrochozoan animals.</str>

      <str>Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which demethylates mono- and dimethylated histone H3-Lys4 as part of a complex including CoREST and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is essential for embryonic development in the mouse beyond embryonic day 6.5 (e6.5). To determine the role of LSD1 during this early period of embryogenesis, we have generated loss-of-function gene trap mice and conditional knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells. Analysis of postimplantation gene trap embryos revealed that LSD1 expression, and therefore function, is restricted to the epiblast. Conditional deletion of LSD1 in mouse ES cells, the in vitro counterpart of the epiblast, revealed a reduction in CoREST protein and associated HDAC activity, resulting in a global increase in histone H3-Lys56 acetylation, but not H3-Lys4 methylation. Despite this biochemical perturbation, ES cells with LSD1 deleted proliferate normally and retain stem cell characteristics. Loss of LSD1 causes the aberrant expression of 588 genes, including those coding for transcription factors with roles in anterior/posterior patterning and limb development, such as brachyury, Hoxb7, Hoxd8, and retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ). The gene coding for brachyury, a key regulator of mesodermal differentiation, is a direct target gene of LSD1 and is overexpressed in e6.5 Lsd1 gene trap embryos. Thus, LSD1 regulates the expression and appropriate timing of key developmental regulators, as part of the LSD1/CoREST/HDAC complex, during early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>Detailed in situ analyses reveal overlapping expression of gsc and Xbra in the early Spemann's organizer. Coexpression is lost during gastrulation suggesting an interaction between these genes. Ectopic expression of gsc ventrally suppresses endogenous Xbra expression and transcription from Xbra promoter reporter gene constructs. Suppression is mediated, at least partially, by a gsc-binding site within the first 349 bp of the promoter. Xbra reporter gene transcription is also suppressed in the region of endogenous gsc expression, whereas high-level ectopic Xbra expression has no effect on endogenous gsc expression. We suggest that early patterning of the vertebrate mesoderm, like early patterning of the Drosophila embryo, occurs by first establishing broad domains of gene expression which are subsequently refined by intergenic interactions to further delimit tissue boundaries.</str>

      <str>We analyzed the expression of proteases and the clinicopathologic significance in non-skull base chordoma (NSBC). By using immunohistochemical techniques, we studied the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, cathepsin B (CatB), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in 29 NSBCs and compared these data with clinicopathologic parameters and the expression of cell differentiation markers. Expression of MMP-1 (P = .092), MMP-2 (P = .041), and CatB (P = .058) was associated with nuclear pleomorphism, a previously described adverse prognostic indicator. Expression of cytokeratin 8 correlated with that of MMP-1 (P = .005), MMP-2 (P = .002), and uPA (P = .032). Patients with higher MMP-2 expression had a poorer prognosis than those with lower MMP-2 expression (P = .013). We believe that NSBCs with nuclear pleomorphism or stronger epithelial character have a higher invasive ability than those without. In addition, high MMP-2 expression was an indicator of an unfavorable clinical outcome in NSBC.</str>

      <str>A classically identified "notochordal" cell population in the nucleus pulposus is thought to regulate disk homeostasis. However, the embryonic origin of these cells has been under dispute for &gt;60 years. Here we provide the first direct evidence that all cell types in the adult mouse nucleus pulposus are derived from the embryonic notochord. Additionally, rare isolated embryonic notochord cells remained in the vertebral column and resembled "notochordal remnants," which in humans have been proposed to give rise to a rare type of late-onset cancer called chordoma. Previously, this cell type had not been identified in the mouse model system. The development and characterization of a mouse model that can be used to fate map nucleus pulposus precursor cells in any mutant background will be useful for uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of disk degeneration. In addition, the identification of notochordal remnants in mice is the first step towards generating an in vivo model of chordoma.</str>

      <str>To the authors' knowledge, no effective medical therapy currently is available for advanced chordoma. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB), BCR-ABL, and KIT.</str>
      <str>Six patients with advanced chordoma were treated with imatinib mesylate at a dose of 800 mg daily. In all patients, the tumor was found to be positive for PDGFRB, and in four patients PDGFRB was shown to be phosphorylated/expressed.</str>
      <str>After a treatment period of &gt; or = 1 year, overt tumor liquefaction was evident on computed tomography (CT) scan in the first patient. In previous months, a decrease in contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a decrease in glucose uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) were detected. Similar signs on MRI and PET were observed in subsequent patients, who had a shorter treatment period. One of these patients initially was removed from therapy and then was readmitted to therapy because of difficulties with regard to tumor response assessment; 1 month after the reinitiation of therapy, an overt decrease in tumor density was visible on CT scan in this patient. In four of five symptomatic patients, a subjective improvement was observed early in the course of treatment. The first patient died after 17 months, with a sizeable, mostly liquefied mass. Another patient died early, apparently of unrelated causes. The remaining patients were on therapy at the time of last follow-up.</str>
      <str>Imatinib mesylate has been found to have antitumor activity in patients with chordoma. This activity might be mediated by inactivation of PDGFRB. Tumor response manifests through patterns that are similar to those observed in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors who respond to molecular-targeted therapy, but evolves more slowly. The benefit to the patient entailed by this pattern of tumor response in chordoma needs to be elucidated, but may be limited in the presence of significant local disease.</str>

      <str>Posterior neuropore (PNP) closure coincides with the end of gastrulation, marking the end of primary neurulation and primary body axis formation. Secondary neurulation and axis formation involve differentiation of the tail bud mesenchyme. Genetic control of the primary-secondary transition is not understood. We report a detailed analysis of gene expression in the caudal region of day 10 mouse embryos during primary neuropore closure. Embryos were collected at the 27-32 somite stage, fixed, processed for whole mount in situ hybridisation, and subsequently sectioned for a more detailed analysis. Genes selected for study include those involved in the key events of gastrulation and neurulation at earlier stages and more cranial levels. Patterns of expression within the tail bud, neural plate, recently closed neural tube, notochord, hindgut, mesoderm, and surface ectoderm are illustrated and described. Specifically, we report continuity of expression of the genes Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Evx1, Fgf8, RARgamma, Brachyury, and Hoxb1 from primitive streak and node into subpopulations of the tail bud and caudal axial structures. Within the caudal notochord, developing floorplate, and hindgut, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, Shh, and Brachyury expression domains correlate directly with known genetic roles and predicted tissue interdependence during induction and differentiation of these structures. The patterns of expression of Wnt5a, Hoxb1, Brachyury, RARgamma, and Evx1, together with observations on proliferation, reveal that the caudal mesoderm is organised at a molecular level into distinct domains delineated by longitudinal and transverse borders before histological differentiation. Expression of Wnt5a in the ventral ectodermal ridge supports previous evidence that this structure is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. These results provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms facilitating transition from primary to secondary body axis formation, as well as the factors involved in defective spinal neurulation.</str>

      <str>The development of in vitro methods for regulatory embryotoxicity testing is challenging since the understanding of chemical effects on the mammalian development is still poor. The aim of the project is to identify marker genes during in vitro cell differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells, in order to predict chemical effects on cell differentiation of specific target tissues. The present study is focusing on the expression pattern by using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR of key genes involved in cardiomyocytes development; i.e. Oct-4, Brachyury, Nkx2.5 and alpha myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC). Two reference chemicals with well-known in vivo data have been analysed by using this approach: retinoic acid and lithium chloride. Retinoic acid has been selected as a teratogen affecting several target tissues, whereas lithium chloride has been described to affect the development of the cardiovascular system. We demonstrate that retinoic acid already affects in the early stage of germ layer formation, which was demonstrated by a change of Oct-4 and Brachyury gene expression. As we expected, the expression of cardiac specific genes (Nkx2.5, alpha-MHC) has been also modified. In contrary, the Oct-4 and Brachyury expression was not changed by lithium treatment. In this case, we observed a modification in the normal gene expression pattern, for alpha-MHC and Nkx2.5, demonstrating that lithium chloride affects the later stage of heart development. These data suggest that the inclusion of selective target organ genes in an established embryotoxicity test allows to predict effects of chemicals and drugs to the heart development.</str>

The tumor mass caused nasopharyngeal swelling and infiltrated the base of the skull and the spinal canal. Aspiration biopsy cytology of the tumor demonstrated mostly papillary epithelial groupings, causing differential diagnostic problems with thyroid and salivary gland carcinomas. Most of the tumor mass was resected, with postoperative radiation performed. Immunohistochemical staining for type II procollagen on the histologic sections confirmed the presence of cartilage. The epithelial components of the tumor appeared to be cytokeratin-positive. Immunohistochemical staining for laminin and type IV collagen revealed positivity only in the blood vessel walls. The diagnosis of cervical chordoma was established by the histologic examination. The patient is without symptoms two years after removal of the tumor.</str>

Hence, a specific and reliable marker that identifies adipocytic differentiation is much sought. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of PIM-1 kinase in 35 samples of soft tissue tumours using tissue microarray technology and 49 full sections of adipocytic (n = 26) and non-adipocytic tumours (n = 23). Benign and malignant adipocytic tumours showed strong expression of PIM-1 while the non-adipocytic tumours were either negative or showed only weak staining for the protein. In myxoid liposarcomas, PIM-1 showed a distinct, unique vacuolar staining pattern, clearly outlining fine cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. By contrast, non-adipocytic myxoid tumours (myxoma, chordoma and myxoid chondrosarcoma) did not show this vacuolar pattern of PIM-1 staining, although vacuolated cells were present on H&amp;E. This differential expression was confirmed at a gene expression level in selected cases. Our results indicate that the expression of PIM-1 in adipose tissue may be a useful marker of adipocytic differentiation, in particular if the staining is both of high intensity and present in a unique, vacuolar pattern.</str>

      <str>We demonstrate that the nuclear, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Xbra causes dorsal mesodermal differentiation of animal cap ectoderm when co-expressed with the secreted proteins noggin and Xwnt-8. None of these molecules causes dorsal mesoderm formation when expressed alone. Co-expression of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) mRNA with noggin mRNA in animal caps specifies the main dorsal tissues, namely muscle, notochord and neural tissue. Co-expression of Xbra with Xwnt-8, in contrast, converts animal caps to muscle masses. We have previously shown that expression of Xbra alone in animal caps is sufficient to specify ventral mesoderm which expresses Xhox3 and low levels of muscle-specific actin. We now conclude that the putative transcription factor Xbra defines a cell state in the vertebrate embryo which can respond to diffusible dorsal signals such as noggin and Xwnt-8, resulting in dorsal mesodermal differentiation. In the absence of such dorsal signals Xbra causes ventral mesodermal differentiation. This state is only partially maintained after the mid-blastula transition as it permits the dorsal response to zygotically expressed noggin but it does not allow a dorsal response to zygotically expressed Xwnt-8, which elicits only ventral mesodermal differentiation.</str>

      <str>The Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, is expressed in the presumptive mesoderm of the early gastrula. Induction of Xbra in animal pole tissue by activin occurs only in a narrow window of activin concentrations; if the level of inducer is too high, or too low, the gene is not expressed. Previously, we have suggested that the suppression of Xbra by high concentrations of activin is due to the action of genes such as goosecoid and Mix.1. Here, we examine the roles played by goosecoid and Mix.1 during normal development, first in the control of Xbra expression and then in the formation of the mesendoderm. Consistent with the model outlined above, inhibition of the function of either gene product leads to transient ectopic expression of Xbra. Such embryos later develop dorsoanterior defects and, in the case of interference with Mix.1, additional defects in heart and gut formation. Goosecoid, a transcriptional repressor, appears to act directly on transcription of Xbra. In contrast, Mix.1, which functions as a transcriptional activator, may act on Xbra indirectly, in part through activation of goosecoid.</str>

      <str>Extrinsic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal and intrinsic factors that determine the response of the signal-receiving blastomeres to FGF regulate mesoderm patterning in embryos of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. To investigate how cells integrate information from extrinsic and intrinsic inputs, we examined Brachyury (Hr-Bra) promoter activity in the early embryo. Hr-Bra, which encodes a key transcription factor for notochord development, is expressed exclusively in notochord precursors in a manner dependent on the FGF-MEK-MAPK-Ets signaling pathway and on the intrinsic factors Zic and FoxA. Reporter gene expression driven by the 900-bp upstream region of the Hr-Bra promoter was detected as early as the 110-cell stage in notochord precursors by in situ hybridization with a LacZ probe. Deletion analysis combined with MEK inhibitor treatment demonstrated that the -598/-499 region carries FGF-responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified three Ets-binding sites in this region that were required for promoter activity. Further deletion analysis conducted by injecting eggs with reporter constructs at higher concentration suggested that the -398/-289 region also has enhancer activity, although ectopic reporter expression was detected in nerve cord and endoderm precursors. The -398/-289 region has a Zic-binding site that was also essential for the enhancer activity. These results indicate that Ets- and Zic-binding sites are critical for the initiation of Hr-Bra expression. In conclusion, information from both extrinsic and intrinsic factors is integrated at the level of enhancer of the target gene by direct binding of the transcription factors to the enhancer region.</str>

      <str>Ligand-bound nuclear receptors (NRs) recruit cofactors such as members of the p160 family and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to activate transcription. We have cloned the Xenopus homologue of the human transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), a member of the p160 family of cofactors. Xenopus TIF2 (XTIF2) mRNA is expressed homogeneously during late blastula-early gastrula stages and later becomes highly expressed in the notochord. To study the function of XTIF2 during development, we have used two dominant negative constructs, one encompassing the NR-binding domain and the other the CBP interacting region of XTIF2. Overexpression of the XTIF2 dominant negative mRNAs causes ectopic expression of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) and MyoD in all tissue layers. Moreover, ectopic expression of the dominant negative construct that contains the CBP-binding region produces strong phenotypes at hatching stage such as loss of head structures, shortened trunks and open blastopores, which can be rescued by XTIF2 coexpression. These observed defects are due, at least in part, to repression of dorsal mesoderm and endoderm genes. Our data suggest the existence of a NR pathway that requires XTIF2 and CBP to repress Xbra and XMyoD.</str>

      <str>BMP is thought to induce hESC differentiation toward multiple lineages including mesoderm and trophoblast. The BMP-induced trophoblast phenotype is a long-standing paradox in stem cell biology. Here we readdressed BMP function in hESCs and mouse epiblast-derived cells. We found that BMP4 cooperates with FGF2 (via ERK) to induce mesoderm and to inhibit endoderm differentiation. These conditions induced cells with high levels of BRACHYURY (BRA) that coexpressed CDX2. BRA was necessary for and preceded CDX2 expression; both genes were essential for expression not only of mesodermal genes but also of trophoblast-associated genes. Maximal expression of the latter was seen in the absence of FGF but these cells coexpressed mesodermal genes and moreover they differed in cell surface and epigenetic properties from placental trophoblast. We conclude that BMP induces human and mouse pluripotent stem cells primarily to form mesoderm, rather than trophoblast, acting through BRA and CDX2.</str>

      <str>The transcription factor Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) plays an essential role in notochord development in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. We characterized a putative Ci-Bra target gene, which we named Ci-multidom, and analyzed in detail its expression pattern in normal embryos and in embryos where Ci-Bra was misexpressed. Ci-multidom encodes a novel protein, which contains eight CCP domains and a partial VWFA domain. We show that an EGFP-multidom fusion protein localizes preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is excluded from the nucleus. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that Ci-multidom is expressed in the notochord and in the anterior neural boundary (ANB). We found that the expression in the ANB is fully recapitulated by an enhancer element located upstream of Ci-multidom. By means of misexpression experiments, we provide evidence that Ci-Bra controls transcription of Ci-multidom in the notochord; however, while Ci-Bra is homogeneously expressed throughout this structure, Ci-multidom is transcribed at detectable levels only in a random subset of notochord cells. The number of notochord cells expressing Ci-multidom varies among different embryos and is independent of developmental stage, lineage, and position along the anterior-posterior axis. These results suggest that despite its morphological simplicity and invariant cell-lineage, the ancestral notochord is a mosaic of cells in which the gene cascade downstream of Brachyury is differentially modulated.</str>

      <str>To analyse the roles of FGF activity and brachyury during gastrulation we have directly compared the consequences of inhibition of FGF-receptor signalling with the phenotype of the zebrafish brachyury mutant, no tail (ntl). We show that expression of ntl is regulated by FGF and that inhibition of FGF receptor-signalling leads to complete loss of the trunk and tail. Since the ntl mutant lacks the tail and notochord but has an otherwise normal trunk, this demonstrates that trunk development is dependent upon an unidentified gene, or set of genes, referred to as no trunk (ntk) which is regulated by FGF. We propose a model to explain the FGF-dependent regulation of ntl and ntk that accounts for the above phenotypes. Consistent with this model, over-expression of eFGF led to suppression of anterior fates and development of trunk and tail derivatives only. In addition, widespread activation of convergence and extension movements resulted in the formation of multiple axis-like structures. Expression of eve1 and cad1 was also regulated by FGF activity, suggesting that during gastrulation FGF activity is normally restricted to the germ ring where these genes, and ntl, are expressed. Taken together these data suggest that the germ ring acts as a posteriorising centre during AP patterning, mediated by FGF activity in this tissue.</str>

We report on two patients with tumors within the pelvis. In one patient, an infiltrating recurrent chordoma within the sacrum was resected with CAOS. The other patient presented with a periacetabular chondrosarcoma. Resection was done with navigation so precise that a custom-made hemipelvis prosthesis with a special coating fit.

Herein, we describe a 57-year-old male patient presenting with a history of retro-orbital headache, progressive loss of vision, and clinical features of hypopituitarism, for over 2 months. During evaluation, the CT scan revealed a large contrast-enhancing intrasellar tumor with a 3.6-cm largest diameter. The patient underwent transsphenoidal partial resection of the tumor, and histological examination was consistent with the diagnosis of chondroid chordoma.

      <str>Classical embryology experiments have indicated the existence of dorsal-type and ventral-type mesoderms that arise as a consequence of mesoderm induction during vertebrate development. Here we report that the zebrafish tbx6 gene, a member of the Brachyury-related T-box family of genes, is exclusively expressed by ventral mesendoderm. Three observations link the expression of tbx6 to ventral mesoderm specification. First, the gene is initially expressed at the onset of gastrulation within a ventrolateral subpopulation of cells that express the pan-mesodermal gene, no tail (Brachyury). Second, the mesoderm-inducing factors activin and bFGF activate tbx6 expression in animal caps. Third, dorsalization of the mesendodermal precursor population following exposure of embryos to lithium ions causes down-regulation of tbx6 transcription. tbx6 is expressed transiently in the involuting derivatives of the ventral mesendoderm, which give rise to nonaxial mesodermal tissues; its expression is extinguished as tissue differentiation progresses. Transcription of tbx6 commences about an hour after initiation of expression of the pan-mesendodermal gene no tail and the organizer gene goosecoid. The dependence of tbx6 expression on no tail activity was examined in no tail mutant embryos. The activation of tbx6 transcription in ventral mesoderm does not depend on no tail gene activity. However, no tail appears to contribute to the maintenance of normal levels of tbx6 transcription and may be required for tbx6 transcription in the developing tail.</str>

      <str>Five cases of chordoma, diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, are presented. Four cases were histologically confirmed, and in one, immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies were performed on both the aspirate and tissue specimen. Four cases presented as sacral masses, while in the fifth case, a destructive lesion of the clivus extended into the soft tissues of the lateral neck. A spectrum of cytomorphologic features was encountered including the presence of abundant microtissue fragments and cells in a dissociate pattern, often with abundant metachromatic extracellular matrix. Stellate and cuboidal cells often contained intracytoplasmic vacuoles of varying sizes. Intranuclear inclusions, mitotic figures, and anisonucleosis were prominent features of several cases. Immunoperoxidase studies on a single case demonstrated cytoplasmic staining for low- and high-molecular-weight cytokeratins, vimentin, and epithelial membrane antigen, while glial fibrillary acidic protein and carcinoembryonic antigen were negative. Ultrastructural features included the presence of mitochondrial endoplasmic reticulum complexes, occasional desmosome-like junctions, and abundant extracellular matrix adherent to the tumor cells. We believe the cytomorphologic findings are characteristic and, when taken in concert with immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies, allow differentiation of chordoma from other primary or metastatic neoplasms occurring in bone. As demonstrated in our series, chordoma is often an unsuspected diagnosis. We believe that FNA biopsy of these lesions can lead to a correct preoperative diagnosis and may also be utilized to document recurrence and thus facilitate the evaluation and management of patients with these lesions.</str>

      <str>Analysis of gene function in Xenopus development frequently involves over-expression experiments, in which RNA encoding the protein of interest is microinjected into the early embryo. By taking advantage of the fate map of Xenopus, it is possible to direct expression of the protein to particular regions of the embryo, but it has not been possible to exert control over the timing of expression; the protein is translated immediately after injection. To overcome this problem in our analysis of the role of Brachyury in Xenopus development, we have, like Kolm and Sive (1995; Dev. Biol. 171, 267-272), explored the use of hormone-inducible constructs. Animal pole regions derived from embryos expressing a fusion protein (Xbra-GR) in which the Xbra open reading frame is fused to the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor develop as atypical epidermis, presumably because Xbra is sequestered by the heat-shock apparatus of the cell. Addition of dexamethasone, which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and releases Xbra, causes formation of mesoderm. We have used this approach to investigate the competence of animal pole explants to respond to Xbra-GR, and have found that competence persists until late gastrula stages, even though by this time animal caps have lost the ability to respond to mesoderm-inducing factors such as activin and FGF. In a second series of experiments, we demonstrate that Xbra is capable of inducing its own expression, but that this auto-induction requires intercellular signals and FGF signalling. Finally, we suggest that the use of inducible constructs may assist in the search for target genes of Brachyury.</str>

      <str>The canonical, beta-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway is a crucial player in the early events of Xenopus development. Dorsal axis formation and mesoderm patterning are accepted effects of this pathway, but the regulation of expression of genes involved in mesoderm specification is not. This conclusion is based largely on the inability of the Wnt pathway to induce mesoderm in animal cap explants. Using injections of inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, we demonstrate that expression of the general mesodermal marker Brachyury (Xbra) requires a zygotic, ligand-dependent Wnt activity throughout the marginal zone. Analysis of the Xbra promoter reveals that putative TCF-binding sites mediate Wnt activation, the first sites in this well-studied promoter to which an activation role can be ascribed. However, established mesoderm inducers like eFGF and activin can bypass the Wnt requirement for Xbra expression. Another mesoderm promoting factor, VegT, activates Xbra in a Wnt-dependent manner. We also show that the activin/nodal signaling is necessary for ectopic Xbra induction by the Wnt pathway, but not by VegT. Our data significantly change the understanding of Brachyury regulation in Xenopus, implying the existence of an unknown zygotic Wnt ligand in Spemann's organizer. Since Brachyury is considered to have a major role in mesoderm formation, it is possible that Wnts might play a role in mesoderm specification, in addition to patterning.</str>

      <str>To reconstruct a minimum complement of notochord genes evolutionarily conserved across chordates, we scanned the Ciona intestinalis genome using the sequences of 182 genes reported to be expressed in the notochord of different vertebrates and identified 139 candidate notochord genes. For 66 of these Ciona genes expression data were already available, hence we analyzed the expression of the remaining 73 genes and found notochord expression for 20. The predicted products of the newly identified notochord genes range from the transcription factors Ci-XBPa and Ci-miER1 to extracellular matrix proteins. We examined the expression of the newly identified notochord genes in embryos ectopically expressing Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and in embryos expressing a repressor form of this transcription factor in the notochord, and we found that while a subset of the genes examined are clearly responsive to Ci-Bra, other genes are not affected by alterations in its levels. We provide a first description of notochord genes that are not evidently influenced by the ectopic expression of Ci-Bra and we propose alternative regulatory mechanisms that might control their transcription.</str>

      <str>CD40 or CD31 overexpression was determined by immunohistochemical staining; the microvessel density (MVD) was calculated according to the CD31 expression. The correlation of CD40 over-expression with tumor recurrence was analyzed.</str>
      <str>56% of the specimens from 36 cases of sacral chordomas overexpressed CD40, which is a significantly higher percentage than for the 2 specimens in 10 in normal notochordal tissue (p &lt; 0.05). 36.84% of the specimens of the 19 recurrent cases were CD40 overexpressing, in contrast to less than 76.47% in the no-recurrence group (p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CD40 overexpression and the resection margins were independent factors contributing to tumor recurrence. The MVD value was 25.71 ± 8.86 mm(-2) in the sacral chordomas and more than 6.63 ± 2.45 mm(-2) in the normal embryonic notochord tissue (p &lt; 0.01). The MVD value in the recurrence group (30.08 ± 7.11 mm(-2)) was significantly higher than that of the no-recurrence group (20.82 ± 8.18 mm(-2); p &lt; 0.05). But the MVD value was significantly lower in the CD40-overexpressing group than in the CD40-less expressing group (p &lt; 0.05).</str>
      <str>CD40 was overexpressed in sacral chordomas, and the overexpression was not dependent on the intratumoral MVD.

We determined by immunohistochemistry the expression of SMA and other muscle and vascular markers in normal bone, GCTB and a wide range of primary benign and malignant bone tumours. Cultured stromal cells of GCTB, chondroblastoma (CB), and aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) were also analysed for SMA expression. SMA was only noted in blood vessels in normal bone. SMA was expressed by mononuclear stromal cells (MSC) cultured from GCTB, ABC and CB. SMA was strongly and diffusely expressed by MSC in non-ossifying fibroma, fibrous dysplasia, and "brown tumour" of hyperparathyroidism. SMA expression was also noted in GCTB, ABC, CB, chondromyxoid fibroma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone and osteosarcoma. Little or no SMA was noted in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, simple bone cyst, Ewing's sarcoma, osteoblastoma, osteoid osteoma, enchondroma, osteochondroma, chondrosarcoma, myeloma, lymphoma, chordoma and adamantinoma. Our findings show that there is differential SMA expression in primary bone tumours and that identifying the presence or absence of SMA is useful in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. The nature of SMA-expressing cells in bone tumours is uncertain but they are negative for desmin and caldesmon and could represent either myofibroblasts or perivascular cells, such as pericytes.</str>

      <str>Members of the T-box family of transcription factors share an evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding domain and play significant roles in various processes of embryonic development. Vertebrate T-box genes are categorized into the following five major subfamilies (eight groups), depending on sequence similarities: Brachyury, Tbx1 (Tbx1/10, Tbx15/18/22, Tbx20), Tbx2/3/4/5 (Tbx2/3 and Tbx4/5), Tbx6, and Tbr/Eomes/TBX21. Ascidians are primitive chordates, and their tadpole larva are considered to represent the simplified and basic body plan of vertebrates. In addition, it has been revealed that the ascidian genome contains the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in development. The present characterization of cDNAs and survey of the Ciona intestinalis draft genome demonstrated that the Ciona genome contains a single copy gene for each of the Brachyury, Tbx1/10, Tbx15/18/22, Tbx20, Tbx2/3, and Tbr/Eomes/TBX21 groups, and at least three copies of the Tbx6 subfamily. Each of the Ciona T-box genes shows a characteristic expression pattern, although that of Tbx20 was not determined in the present study. These results provide basic information that will be useful for future studies of the function of each gene, genetic cascades of different T-box genes, and genome-wide surveys of evolutionary changes in the T-box gene structure and organization in this primitive chordate.</str>

      <str>T-box gene family members have important roles during murine embryogenesis, gastrulation, and organogenesis. Although relatively little is known about how T-box genes are regulated, published gene expression studies have revealed dynamic and specific patterns in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues of the mouse conceptus. Mutant alleles of the T-box gene Brachyury (T) have identified roles in formation of mesoderm and its derivatives, such as somites and the allantois. However, given the cell autonomous nature of T gene activity and conflicting results of gene expression studies, it has been difficult to attribute a primary function to T in normal allantoic development. We report localization of T protein by sectional immunohistochemistry in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues during mouse gastrulation, emphasizing T localization within the allantois. T was detected in all previously reported sites within the conceptus, including the primitive streak and its derivatives, nascent embryonic mesoderm, the node and notochord, as well as notochord-associated endoderm and posterior neurectoderm. In addition, we have clarified T within the allantois, where it was first detected in the proximal midline of the late allantoic bud (approximately 7.5 days postcoitum, dpc) and persisted within an expanded midline domain until 6-somite pairs (s; approximately 8.5 dpc). Lastly, we have discovered several novel T sites, including the developing heart, visceral endoderm, extraembryonic ectoderm, and its derivative, chorionic ectoderm. Together, these data provide a unified picture of T in the mammalian conceptus, and demonstrate T's presence in unrelated cell types and tissues in highly dynamic spatiotemporal patterns in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues.</str>

      <str>We present evidence that the embryo of the ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, is an easily manipulated system for investigating the establishment of basic chordate tissues and organs. Ciona has a small genome, and simple, well-defined embyronic lineages. Here, we examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the notochord. Particular efforts center on the regulation of a notochord-specific Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra). An electroporation method was devised for the efficient incorporation of transgenic DNA into Ciona embryos. This method permitted the identification of a minimal, 434 bp enhancer from the Ci-Bra promoter region that mediates the notochord-restricted expression of both GFP and lacZ reporter genes. This enhancer contains a negative control region that excludes Ci-Bra expression from inappropriate embryonic lineages, including the trunk mesenchyme and tail muscles. Evidence is presented that the enhancer is activated by a regulatory element which is closely related to the recognition sequence of the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor, thereby raising the possibility that the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in notochord differentiation. We discuss the implications of this analysis with regard to the evolutionary conservation of integrative enhancers, and the subdivision of the axial and paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates.</str>

      <str>T-box genes are potent regulators of mesoderm development in many metazoans. In chordate embryos, the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (Bra) is required for specification and differentiation of the notochord. In some chordates, including the ascidian Ciona, members of the Tbx2 subfamily of T-box genes are also expressed in this tissue; however, their regulatory relationships with Bra and their contributions to the development of the notochord remain uncharacterized. We determined that the notochord expression of Ciona Tbx2/3 (Ci-Tbx2/3) requires Ci-Bra, and identified a Ci-Tbx2/3 notochord CRM that necessitates multiple Ci-Bra binding sites for its activity. Expression of mutant forms of Ci-Tbx2/3 in the developing notochord revealed a role for this transcription factor primarily in convergent extension. Through microarray screens, we uncovered numerous Ci-Tbx2/3 targets, some of which overlap with known Ci-Bra-downstream notochord genes. Among the Ci-Tbx2/3 notochord targets are evolutionarily conserved genes, including caspases, lineage-specific genes, such as Noto4, and newly identified genes, such as MLKL. This work sheds light on a large section of the notochord regulatory circuitry controlled by T-box factors, and reveals new components of the complement of genes required for the proper formation of this structure.</str>

      <str>Cellular self-organization studies have been mainly focused on models such as Volvox, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, and animal (metazoan) embryos. Moreover, animal tissues undergoing regeneration also exhibit properties of embryonic systems such as the self-organization process that rebuilds tissue complexity and function. We speculated that the recreation in vitro of the biological, biophysical, and biomechanical conditions similar to those of a regenerative milieu could elicit the intrinsic capacity of differentiated cells to proceed to the development of a tissue-like structure. Here we show that, when primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts are cultured in a soft nanofiber scaffold, they establish a cellular network that causes an organized cell contraction,proliferation, and migration that ends in the formation of a symmetrically bilateral structure with a distinct central axis. A subset of mesodermal genes (brachyury, Sox9, Runx2) is upregulated during this morphogenetic process. The expression of brachyury was localized first at the central axis, extending then to both sides of the structure. The spontaneous formation of cartilage-like tissue mainly at the paraxial zone followed expression ofSox9 and Runx2. Because cellular self-organization is an intrinsic property of the tissues undergoing development,this model could lead to new ways to consider tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</str>

      <str>Recently, physical factors in the local cellular microenvironment have been confirmed with strong influences on regulating stem cell fate. Despite the recent identification of the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) as a bioreactor for culturing stem cells, the underlying biological role provided by RCCS in the lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains largely undefined. Here, we explored the embryoid body (EB) formation and subsequent differentiation of mouse ESCs in RCCS. We demonstrated that EBs formed in RCCS were more homogeneous and bigger in size compared with those in the static condition. Further, we determined that mesendoderm differentiation was prominently enhanced, while neuroectodermal differentiation was significantly suppressed in RCCS. Surprisingly, we found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was greatly enhanced mainly due to the increased expression of Wnt3 during ESC differentiation in RCCS. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by DKK1 decreased the expression of Brachyury and attenuated mesendoderm differentiation in RCCS. Intriguingly, Wnt3a markedly increased Brachyury expression under static condition rather than in RCCS. Taken together, our findings uncover a new role of rotary suspension culture in initializing the early differentiation of ESCs. </str>

      <str>One major difference between simple metazoans such as cnidarians and all the bilaterian animals is thought to involve the invention of mesoderm. The terms diploblasts and triploblasts are therefore, often used to group prebilaterian and bilaterian animals, respectively. However, jellyfish contain well developed striated and smooth muscle tissues that derive from the entocodon, a mesoderm-like tissue formed during medusa development. We investigated the hypothesis, that the entocodon could be homologous to the third germ layer of bilaterians by analyzing the structures and expression patterns of the homologues of Brachyury, Mef2, and Snail in the jellyfish Podocoryne carnea. These are regulatory genes from the T-box, MADS-box and zinc finger families known to play important roles in bilaterian mesoderm patterning and muscle differentiation. The sequence and expression data demonstrate that the genes are structurally and functionally conserved and even more similar to humans or other deuterostomes than to protostome model organisms such as Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans. Based on these data we conclude that the common ancestor of the cnidarians and bilaterians not only shared genes that play a role in regulating myogenesis but already used them to develop and differentiate muscle systems similar to those of triploblasts.</str>

Their major clinical manifestations included headache, cranial nerve damage and dyspnea. They were classified according to the patterns of tumor growth: Type I (n = 13): tumor location at a single component of skull base, i. e. clivus or sphenoid sinus with intact cranial dura; Type II (n = 56): tumor involving more than two components of skull e. g clivus, sphenoid and nasal/oral cavity, etc. But there was no intracranial invasion; Type III (n = 32) : tumor extending widely and intradurally forming compression of brain stems and multiple cranial nerves. Based on the types of chordoma, different endoscopic approaches were employed, viz. transnasal, transoral, trans-subtemporal fossa and plus microsurgical craniotomy for staging in some complex cases.</str>
      <str>Among all patients, total resection was achieved (n = 19), subtotal (n = 58) and partial (n = 24).

Self-care recovery within one week post-operation accounted for 58.4%, two weeks 30.7%, one month 6.9% and more than one month 1.9%. Postoperative complications occurred in 13 cases (12.8%) and included CSF leakage (n = 4) cranial nerve palsy (n = 5), hemorrhagic nasal wounds (n = 3) and delayed intracranial hemorrhage (n = 1).

In radiographs of the lumbar spine there was narrowing of the intervertebral disc space at L5-L6 with irregular, multifocal areas of mineralized opacities dorsal to the intervertebral disc space, presumably within the vertebral canal. On computed tomography, an intramedullary, partially mineralized mass was identified in the spinal cord at the level of caudal L5 through cranial L6. At necropsy there was a four-centimeter enlarged, irregular segment of spinal cord at the level of L5-L6. When sectioned, the spinal cord bad a mineralized texture. Histologically there were variable sized cells that were stellate in appearance with vacuolated cytoplasm (physaliferous cells) and mucinous background consistent with a chordoma. Chordoma is a rare, skeletal neoplasm that originates from mesoderm-derived notochord and has been reported in humans and animals. Extraskeletal development of a chordoma within the spinal cord is a rare manifestation of this neoplasm. However, based on other reports in dogs, solitary extraskeletal locations of chordomas may be the typical expression of this neoplasm in the dog.

      <str>Three 22-gauge needles were inserted at the upper, middle, and lower parts of the tumor and advanced under computed tomographic guidance while injecting local anesthetic. A 5-mg/mL carboplatin solution was combined with epinephrine (to increase the concentration and antitumor effect of carboplatin) at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL and an iodinated contrast agent. We injected 3 to 5 mL of this solution over 5 minutes through each needle under computed tomographic guidance. Eleven intratumoral treatments were performed during an 18-month period.</str>
      <str>A marked clinical response with regression of the spinal cord compression was observed, without specific toxicity. A good partial response was obtained with a 42% decrease in tumor volume (from 69 to 40 cm3). Moreover, the central part of the tumor showed tumor necrosis, as confirmed by histological examination. Thus, in patients with this rare tumor, intratumoral chemotherapy may be a valid treatment option when surgery and radiation therapy fail. Furthermore, intratumoral chemotherapy in combination with surgical treatment should be considered to improve the local control rate.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of fractionated three-dimensional stereotactic radiotherapy on local tumor control and radiation induced side effects in patients with spheno-occipital chordoma.</str>
      <str>13 patients with chordoma of the clivus (8 female, 5 male, median age at radiotherapy 42 years) were treated with a three-dimensional non-coplanar stereotactic irradiation technique using 15 MeV-photons. Median dose applied was 70 Gy. Irradiation was performed in 2 patients after biopsy and in 11 patients after resection of chordoma (2 R1-resections and 9 R2-resections).</str>
      <str>After a median follow-up period of 32 months (4 to 80 months) 12 patients are alive (92%). One patient died 4 months after radiotherapy due to tumor progression. Three of the surviving patients developed local recurrence. Until now local tumor control is 69%. In two patients who had macroscopic tumor after surgery a complete regression occurred (verified by CT and MRI respectively). Early radiation complications were moderate, only headache and dizziness were observed. Also late radiation complications were low. Only one patient developed an endocrine dysfunction due to pituitary injury. Ongoing hormone replacement was necessary in this case. No patient developed sequelae of the optic system, cranial nerves or brain stem.</str>
      <str>With regard to local tumor control our results are in the more favorable range compared to the results obtained with conventional photon irradiation techniques. In spite of the high doses applied both early and late radiation complications were in an acceptable range. Further adequate follow-up must prove, whether these promising results will be corroborated in the future.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordoma are still challenging. Between May 1993 and June 2005, 106 consecutive patients with skull base chordoma underwent surgical removal at Skull Base Division of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, China. Retrospective analysis included medical charts and images. The age of the patients ranged from 7 to 65 years old, with an average age of 35.6 years. Sixty patients were male; the other 46 were female (1.3:1). Follow up data were available in 79 cases ranging from 10 to 158 months (average 63.9 months) after operation. The prognostic factors for recurrence and survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression and t-test. Overall, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years survival rates were 87.2%, 79.4%, 67.6%and 59.5% respectively. One, 3, 5 and 10 year recurrent rates were 19.1%, 34.7%, 52.9% and 88.3%, respectively. The long term outcome of the skull base chordomas is poor. The previous radiotherapy or surgery, dedifferentiated pathology, and less tumor resection are risk factors for longterm survival and recurrence (p &lt; 0.05). Although there is no statistic significant role of tumor adherent to vital structure for outcome (p = 0.051), it can not exclude its importance for favorable outcome. Gender, age, tumor size and staging are not independent risk factors for outcome. Surgical technique leading to radical tumor resection with less morbidity is advocatory and beneficial for patients with skull base chordoma with long term outcome, if the tumor could be exposed and resected completely, the recurrence rate was very low for most benign chordomas.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare and indolent bone tumors that arise in the skull base and mobile spine. Distant metastases occur in &gt;20% of cases, but morbidity and mortality are mainly related to local relapses that affect the majority of patients. Standard chemotherapy has modest activity, whereas new targeted therapies (alone or in combination) have some activity in controlling disease progression. However, the scarcity of preclinical models capable of testing in vivo responses to these therapies hampers the development of new medical strategies.</str>
      <str>In this study, 8 chordoma samples taken from 8 patients were implanted in nude mice. Four engrafted successfully and gave rise to tumor masses that were analyzed histologically, by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization and biochemical techniques. The data relating to each of the mouse tumors were compared with those obtained from the corresponding human tumor.</str>
      <str>All 4 engraftments retained the histological, genetic and biochemical features of the human tumors they came from. In one epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)-positive xenograft, responsiveness to lapatinib was evaluated by comparing the pre- and post treatment findings.

      <str>The endogenous mechanism that determines vertebrate body length is unknown but must involve loss of chordo-neural-hinge (CNH)/axial stem cells and mesoderm progenitors in the tailbud. In early embryos, Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) maintains a cell pool that progressively generates the body and differentiation onset is driven by retinoid repression of FGF signalling. This raises the possibility that FGF maintains key tailbud cell populations and that rising retinoid activity underlies cessation of body axis elongation. Here we show that sudden loss of the mesodermal gene (Brachyury) from CNH and the mesoderm progenitor domain correlates with FGF signalling decline in the late chick tailbud. This is accompanied by expansion of neural gene expression and a similar change in cell fate markers is apparent in the human tailbud. Fate mapping of chick tailbud further revealed that spread of neural gene expression results from continued ingression of CNH-derived cells into the position of the mesoderm progenitor domain. Using gain and loss of function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we then show that attenuation of FGF/Erk signalling mediates this loss of Brachyury upstream of Wnt signalling, while high-level FGF maintains Brachyury and can induce ectopic CNH-like cell foci. We further demonstrate a rise in endogenous retinoid signalling in the tailbud and show that here FGF no longer opposes retinoid synthesis and activity. Furthermore, reduction of retinoid signalling at late stages elevated FGF activity and ectopically maintained mesodermal gene expression, implicating endogenous retinoid signalling in loss of mesoderm identity. Finally, axis termination is concluded by local cell death, which is reduced by blocking retinoid signalling, but involves an FGFR-independent mechanism. We propose that cessation of body elongation involves loss of FGF-dependent mesoderm identity in late stage tailbud and provide evidence that rising endogenous retinoid activity mediates this step and ultimately promotes cell death in chick tailbud.</str>

      <str>Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from mouse postimplantation embryos at embryonic day (E) 5.5-E7.5 at the onset of gastrulation, which makes them a valuable tool for studying mammalian postimplantation development in vitro. EpiSCs can also be reprogrammed into a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-like state. Some reports have shown that the reversion of EpiSCs requires transcription factor overexpression, whereas others have suggested that use of stringent mESC culture conditions alone is sufficient for the reversion of EpiSCs. To clarify these discrepancies, we systematically compared a panel of independent EpiSC lines. We found that--regardless of the embryonic day of derivation--the different EpiSC lines shared a number of defining characteristics such as the ability to form teratomas. However, despite use of standard EpiSC culture conditions, some lines exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with mesendodermal differentiation. Pluripotency (Oct4) and mesodermal (Brachyury) marker genes were coexpressed in this subset of lines. Interestingly, the expression of mesendodermal marker genes was negatively correlated with the cells' ability to efficiently undergo neural induction. Moreover, these mesodermal marker gene-expressing cell lines could not be efficiently reverted to an mESC-like state by using stringent mESC culture conditions. Conversely, Brachyury overexpression diminished the reversion efficiency in otherwise Brachyury-negative lines. Overall, our data suggest that different EpiSC lines may undergo self-renewal into distinct developmental states, a finding with important implications for functional readouts such as reversion of EpiSCs to an mESC-like state as well as directed differentiation.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a T-box transcription factor, is expressed in ascidian embryos exclusively in primordial notochord cells and plays a pivotal role in differentiation of notochord cells. Previously, we identified approximately 450 genes downstream of Ciona intestinalis Brachyury (Ci-Bra), and characterized the expression profiles of 45 of these in differentiating notochord cells. In this study, we looked for cisregulatory sequences in minimal enhancers of 20 Ci-Bra downstream genes by electroporating region within approximately 3 kb upstream of each gene fused with lacZ. Eight of the 20 reporters were expressed in notochord cells. The minimal enchancer for each of these eight genes was narrowed to a region approximately 0.5-1.0-kb long. We also explored the genome-wide and coordinate regulation of 43 Ci-Bra-downstream genes. When we determined their chromosomal localization, it became evident that they are not clustered in a given region of the genome, but rather distributed evenly over 13 of the 14 pairs of chromosomes, suggesting that gene clustering does not contribute to coordinate control of the Ci-Bra downstream gene expression. Our results might provide Insights Into the molecular mechanisms underlying notochord formation in chordates.</str>

      <str>Differences in cell responsiveness to an inductive signal contribute to the emergence of a variety of tissue types during animal development. In ascidian embryos, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signal secreted from endoderm cells induces several different tissue types, such as notochord, mesenchyme and brain, at different positions in the embryo at the 32-cell stage. We show here in Halocynthia roretzi that FoxA and Zic are required for notochord formation in cells that receive the FGF signal. We also show that these transcription factors, only when both are supplied, are able to induce ectopic expression of the brachyury gene, a notochord-specific marker, in cells of all the three germ layers in an FGF-dependent manner. These results suggest that FoxA and Zic confer notochord-specific responsiveness to FGF signaling. Further analyses including knockdown and over-expression experiments showed that combinatorial inputs from maternally supplied and zigotically activated factors lead to overlapping expression of FoxA and Zic in the presumptive notochord cells, which eventually activate the expression of the brachyury gene in cooperation with FGF signaling. Our data illustrate how a complex gene network specifies the notochord at its specific position within the embryo.</str>

      <str>The node, or its zebrafish equivalent, Kupffers Vesicle (KV), is thought to generate laterality cues through cilia-dependent signaling. An interaction between Nodal ligands and Nodal antagonists around the node/KV is also required. Here we investigate whether loss of Brachyury/Notail or Tbx16/Spadetail disrupts the balance of Nodal ligands (Southpaw) and antagonists (Charon) around Kupffers Vesicle. Reduction of Spadetail or Notail disrupts expression of southpaw in the perinodal domains flanking Kupffers Vesicle. Similar to what was published for Notail, we find Spadetail is also required for expression of charon. We present evidence for the model that Notail has a direct role in regulating the charon promoter. In particular, a flanking genomic region with putative Notail binding sites can drive KV expression of a reporter in a Notail-dependent fashion. This region also contains motifs for CSL/RBP-J/Su(H). Consistent with this, we find charon expression is strongly Notch-dependent whereas perinodal southpaw expression is not.</str>

The patient was a 40-year-old man with a 2-year history of progressive ataxia, a memory disorder, and emotional instability. A magnetic resonance (MR) image of the brain revealed a midline posterior fossa mass measuring 4 cm in diameter located between the clivus and the brainstem. The basilar artery and its bifurcation were encased by the tumor, which also distorted the brainstem. The patient had been treated at another hospital for obstructive hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and he received fractionated external-beam radiation treatment, although no histological diagnosis was ever made. The authors achieved a subtotal resection of the tumor through the patient's nostril using an endoscopic transsphenoidal technique. The portion of the tumor located behind the basilar artery was not resected to protect the brainstem perforating arteries. The patient showed dramatic improvement of his symptoms postoperatively.

Authors describe clinical and pathological findings of the tumor and underline peculiarity of spinal localization and difficulty of diagnosis, often delayed, particularly in sacral spine localizations. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy give poor results while surgery can be employed in the treatment on account of the slow evolution and of the not very frequent aptitude of the tumor to give metastases. However peculiar localization into the sacral spine allows to remove the whole tumor if only it is localized below the 2nd sacral vertebra; authors present such a case treated by means of subtotal resection of sacrum and coccyx. In proximal sacral localizations and in other spinal localizations, surgery is a palliative procedure and can only slow down the evolution of the tumor; recurrence is a rule, even in association with radiotherapy.

      <str>Gastrulation in the amphibian embryo is driven by cells of the mesoderm. One of the genes that confers mesodermal identity in Xenopus is Brachyury (Xbra), which is required for normal gastrulation movements and ultimately for posterior mesoderm and notochord differentiation in the development of all vertebrates. Xbra is a transcription activator, and interference with transcription activation leads to an inhibition of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation. To understand this process, we have screened for downstream target genes of Brachyury (Tada, M., Casey, E., Fairclough, L. and Smith, J. C. (1998) Development 125, 3997-4006). This approach has now allowed us to isolate Xwnt11, whose expression pattern is almost identical to that of Xbra at gastrula and early neurula stages. Activation of Xwnt11 is induced in an immediate-early fashion by Xbra and its expression in vivo is abolished by a dominant-interfering form of Xbra, Xbra-En(R). Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Xwnt11, like overexpression of Xbra-En(R), inhibits convergent extension movements. This inhibition can be rescued by Dsh, a component of the Wnt signalling pathway and also by a truncated form of Dsh which cannot signal through the canonical Wnt pathway involving GSK-3 and (beta)-catenin. Together, our results suggest that the regulation of morphogenetic movements by Xwnt11 occurs through a pathway similar to that involved in planar polarity signalling in Drosophila.</str>

      <str>In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the posterior axis and tail formation in embryogenesis, the function of Neptune, a zinc-finger transcription factor, in Xenopus laevis embryos was investigated. Injection of neptune mRNA into the animal pole area of embryos resulted in the formation of an additional tail structure that included a neural tube and muscle tissue. This activity required FGF signaling since coinjection of a dominant-negative FGF receptor RNA (XFD) completely blocked the formation of a tail structure. A loss-of-function experiment using a fusion construct of neptune and Drosophila engrailed (en-neptune) RNA showed that endogenous Neptune is necessary for formation of the posterior trunk and tail. Furthermore, activity of Neptune was necessary for the endogenous expression of brachyury and fgf-8 at the late gastrula stage. These findings demonstrate a novel function of Neptune in the process of anterior-posterior axis formation through the FGF and brachyury signaling cascades. An experiment using a combination explant with ventral and dorsal marginal tissues showed that cooperation of these two distinct tissues is important for the tail formation and that expression of Neptune in prospective ventral cells may be involved in the activation of the process of tail formation.</str>

      <str>The midline has a theoretical role in the development of left-right asymmetry, and this is supported by both genetic analyses and experimental manipulation of midline structures in vertebrates. The mouse brachyury (T) gene encodes a transcription factor which is expressed in the developing notochord and is required for its development. T/T mice lack a mature notochord and have a dorsalised neural tube. We have examined the hearts of T/T mice and have found consistent morphological abnormalities, resulting in ventrally displaced ventricular loops, and a 50% incidence of inverted heart situs. Three TGF-beta related genes, lefty-1, lefty-2 and nodal, are expressed asymmetrically in mouse embryos, and are implicated in the development of situs. We find that nodal, which is normally expressed around the node and in left lateral plate mesoderm in early somite embryos, is completely absent at this stage in T/T embryos. In contrast, lefty-1 and lefty-2, which are normally expressed in the left half of prospective floorplate and left lateral plate mesoderm, respectively, are both expressed in T/T embryos only in a broad patch of ventral cells in, and just rostral to, the node region. These results implicate the node as a source of instructive signals driving expression of nodal and lefty-2 in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and being required for normal looping and situs of the heart.</str>

      <str>The mouse Brachyury (T) gene is required for differentiation of the notochord and formation of mesoderm during posterior development. Homozygous embryos lacking T activity do not develop a trunk and tail and die in utero. The T gene is specifically expressed in notochord and early mesoderm cells in the embryo. recent data have demonstrated that the T protein is localized in the cell nucleus and specifically binds to a palindrome of 20 bp (the T site) in vitro. We show that the T protein activates expression of a reporter gene in HeLa cells through binding to the T site. Thus T is a novel tissue-specific transcription factor. It consists of a large N-terminal DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-229) and two pairs of transactivation and repression domains in the C-terminal protein half. T can also transactivate transcription through variously oriented and spaced T sites, a fact that may be relevant in the search for genes controlled by T protein and important in mesoderm development.</str>

      <str>Chordates are thought to have emerged from some common ancestor of deuterostomes by organizing shared anatomical and embryological features including a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord and pharyngeal gill slits. Because the notochord is the most prominent feature of chordates and because the Brachyury (T) gene is essential for notochord formation, the T gene is a key molecular probe with which to explore the origin and evolution of chordates. We investigated whether the sea urchin (echinoderm) conserves the T gene and, if so, where the sea urchin T gene is expressed. A cDNA clone for the sea urchin T (HpTa) gene contained a long open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 434 amino acids. Although the overall degree of amino acid identity was not very high (52%, sea urchin/mouse), in the T domain of the N terminus the amino acid identity was 73% (sea urchin/mouse). The HpTa gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome. As with the chordate T gene, the expression of HpTa is transient, being first detected in the swimming blastula, maximally transcribed in the gastrula, decreasing at the prism larval stage and barely detectable at the pluteus larval stage. HpTa transcripts were found in the secondary mesenchyme founder cells, vegetal plate of the mesenchyme blastula, extending tip of the invaginating archenteron and, finally, the secondary mesenchyme cells at the late-gastrula stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Tumors contain a small population of cancer stem cells (CSC) proposed to be responsible for tumor maintenance and relapse. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity has been used as a functional stem cell marker to isolate CSCs in different cancer types. This study used the Aldefluor® assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to isolate ALDH1(high) cells from five human sarcoma cell lines and one primary chordoma cell line. ALDH1(high) cells range from 0.3% (MUG-Chor1) to 4.1% (SW-1353) of gated cells. Immunohistochemical staining, analysis of the clone formation efficiency, and xCELLigence microelectronic sensor technology revealed that ALDH1(high) cells from all sarcoma cell lines have an increased proliferation rate compared to ALDH1(low) cells. By investigating of important regulators of stem cell biology, real-time RT-PCR data showed an increased expression of c-Myc, β-catenin, and SOX-2 in the ALDH1(high) population and a significant higher level of ABCG2. Statistical analysis of data demonstrated that ALDH1(high) cells of SW-982 and SW-1353 showed higher resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin, epirubicin, and cisplatin than ALDH1(low) cells. This study demonstrates that in different sarcoma cell lines, high ALDH1 activity can be used to identify a subpopulation of cells characterized by a significantly higher proliferation rate, increased colony forming, increased expression of ABC transporter genes and stemness markers compared to control cells. In addition, enhanced drug resistance was demonstrated.</str>

      <str>To assess the clinical results of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PT) in the treatment of skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas (CS).</str>
      <str>Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy x 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months).</str>
      <str>Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5% and 100% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90% and 93.8%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age &lt; or =40 years at the time of PT affected favorably on PFS (p = 0.09).</str>

      <str>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis formation. Thus, we determined the expression of MMPs in various primary and metastatic spinal tumors in order to assess the role of these enzymes in spinal invasion. MMP expression was examined by immunohistochemical localization, and quantitative evaluation of MMP protein content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. MMP enzyme activity was determined by gelatin zymography. Lung carcinomas and melanomas metastatic to the spine were shown to have higher levels of MMP-9 activity than those of breast, thyroid, renal metastases and primary spinal tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed similar difference in expression of MMP-9 in tissue samples. When the tissue samples were subjected to gelatin zymography for examination of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and to ELISA and Western blotting for quantitative estimation of protein content, the most striking results were obtained for lung carcinomas and melanomas relative to the other tumors. Lung carcinomas and melanomas metastatic to the spine had considerably higher levels of MMP-9 activity than those of primary spinal tumor or breast, thyroid, and renal carcinoma metastases. Within the metastatic tumor category, neoplasms that are known to be associated with the shortest overall survival rates and most aggressive behavior, such as lung carcinomas and melanomas, had the highest levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity compared to those less aggressive metastatic tumors such as breast, renal cell, and thyroid carcinomas. Our results suggest that MMPs may contribute to the metastases to the spinal column, and overexpression of these enzymes may correlate with enhanced invasive properties of both primary and metastatic spinal tumors.</str>

      <str>Twenty-one cases of chordoma arising in the mobile spine were retrospectively reviewed.</str>
      <str>All the cases were submitted to oncologic and surgical staging to correlate treatment and outcome.</str>
      <str>Excluding plasmacytomas, chordoma is the most frequent primary malignant tumor of the spine, occurring mainly in elderly men. The course of the disease is slow, metastases occur late, and death can result from complications related to local extension of the disease. Complete excision of the tumor according to oncologic criteria can be hampered by extension of the tumor and by anatomic constraints in the mobile spine.</str>
      <str>All charts, radiographs, and images were reviewed. The composite information provided by this review allowed for oncologic and surgical staging of these cases. Treatment was defined according to Ennekings criteria. All the patients were followed for determination of their status clinically and radiographically.</str>
      <str>Ten patients died (1 to 137 months after treatment, mean 65 months); four patients are alive with the disease; only seven patients (33%) are symptom free at the final follow-up (39 to 112 months after treatment, mean 65 months). Conventional radiation therapy was not effective in eradicating the tumor, even if associated with palliative or debulking surgery: of 15 cases, 12 were associated with recurrence or progression. Intralesional surgery also was not effective (two recurrences in two cases, 18 to 41 months later). En bloc excision of the lesion, sometimes combined with radiation therapy as an adjuvant, obtained the best results (four patients disease free at 39 to 112 months, mean 77 months).</str>

      <str>Chordomas of the cervical spine are rare tumors. Although en bloc resection has proven to be the ideal procedure in other areas, there is controversy regarding this approach in the cervical spine. The goal in this study was to determine whether piecemeal tumor resection was efficient in the management of chordomas that arise in this location.</str>
      <str>The authors retrospectively reviewed all 74 cases of chordoma treated by their group. Seven patients with isolated cervical chordomas who were treated between October 1992 and January 2006 were identified. There were four male and three female patients, whose ages ranged from 6 to 61 years (mean 34.4 years). Follow-up duration ranged from 7 to 169 months (median 23 months). All cases were managed using a retrocarotid approach with mobilization of the vertebral artery. When the tumor could not be completely resected via the initial anterior approach, a subsequent posterior resection was performed. Tumor resection was intralesional in all cases, and gross-total tumor resection was achieved in six cases. One patient required a second resection 4 months later. In all cases, a posterior stabilization procedure was performed. Five patients underwent anterior fusion (three with fibular allograft and two with iliac crest), whereas two underwent occipitocervical fusion. In two patients with dedifferentiated chordoma metastasis developed, and one of them died 7 months later. The other patient with metastasis died suddenly at home 26 months postsurgery, presumably from aspiration. At the time of this submission, there were no signs of recurrence in five patients.</str>
      <str>The authors believe that, in most cases, en bloc resection of cervical chordoma is not feasible. This is due to the tendency of chordomas to involve multiple compartments at the time of diagnosis. In the authors' experience, intralesional radical resection remains an effective surgical approach to this disease entity.</str>

      <str>An extensive sacrococcygeal chordoma is considered a challenge for neurosurgeons. Because of the complex anatomy of the sacral region, the risk of uncontrollable intraoperative hemorrhage, and the typically large tumor size at presentation, complete resections are technically difficult and the tumor recurrence rate is high. The aim of this study was to assess the value of using occlusion of the abdominal aorta by means of a balloon dilation catheter and electrophysiological monitoring when an extensive sacrococcygeal chordoma is removed.</str>
      <str>Between 2004 and 2008, 9 patients underwent resection of extensive sacrococcygeal chordomas in the authors' department with the aid of occlusion of the abdominal aorta and electrophysiological monitoring. All of these operations were performed via the posterior approach. The records of the 9 patients were reviewed retrospectively.</str>
      <str>Wide resections were performed in 6 cases and marginal excisions in the other 3. Five patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative hemorrhage was controlled at 100-400 ml. Postoperatively, none of the patients had any new neurological dysfunction, and 2 patients regained normal urinary and bowel function. The mean follow-up period was 31.4 months (range 10-57 months). No patient developed local recurrence or had metastatic spread of tumor during follow-up.</str>
      <str>Occlusion of the abdominal aorta and electrophysiological monitoring are useful methods for assisting in resection of sacrococcygeal chordoma. They can reduce intraoperative hemorrhage and entail little chance of tumor cell contamination. They can also help surgeons to protect the organs in the pelvic cavity and neurological function.

      <str>To evaluate MR imaging of sacrococcygeal chordoma.</str>
      <str>Thirty patients (age range 22-80 years) underwent MR imaging for the diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of sacrococcygeal chordomas. Eight patients had follow-up MR examination after treatment. The MR images were performed with T1- and T2-weighted imaging, and gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced imaging. The MR images were analyzed for the signal intensity, enhancing pattern, tumor size, growth pattern of the soft tissue component, and tumor extension.</str>
      <str>T1-weighted images showed low signal masses with foci of high signal intensity in 73% of cases. Tumors enhanced in a variety of patterns after the administration of Gd. Soft tissue masses extending anteriorly were seen in all cases with posterior extension in 77% of cases. The posterior masses involved the surrounding muscles and extended toward the greater sciatic notch, appearing with pseudopodia (87%). Sacroiliac joints were involved in 23% of cases. Four lesions showed intraspinal extension and involvement of the posterior spinal muscles above the level of bony involvement. In 6 patients recurrent tumors were found at or around the surgical margin of the tumor 6 months to 5 years after resection of the sacral tumor. In two of the patients, nodular metastases to the pelvic bones and femur were found 1-4 years after initial examination. In conclusion, MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis and preoperative assessment of sacrococcygeal chordoma. Characteristic findings included sacral mass with heterogeneously high signal intensity with crisscrossing septa on long-repetition-time imaging, well-encapsulated pseudopodia-like or lobulated appearance, and gluteal muscle infiltration.

A plain skull film showed normal finding with no calcification. CT showed a spherical ring contrast enhancement with intraluminal low density area in the suprasellar cistern. Pneumoencephalogram showed a suprasellar mass with filling defect of the anterior part of the third ventricle. On February 28, 1981, the tumor was intracapsually removed by transfrontal approach. The tumor had re-brown-turbid fluid. On March 16, she was discharged with no disturbance of visual acuity and visual field. But she again complained of visual disturbance and was hospitalized on October 26, 1981. Second operation was performed through trans-frontal route. The tumor with pus-like fluid was resected subtotally and postoperative radiation was given with 4,500 rads. Histologically the tumor had physaliferous cells cytomorphologically. Cytochemical study: cytoplasm and matrix were detected positively with PAS stain, Mucicarmine stain, Alcian blue stain, and Colloid-Iron stain. Mucinous glycogen was positive by PAS stain after diastase digestion test. These mucinous material was not stained with Sudan stain.

      <str>We have produced null mutant mouse embryonic stem cells for the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Such E-cadherin-/- ES cells are defective in cell aggregation; this defect can be corrected by transfection with cDNA for either E-cadherin or N-cadherin driven by a constitutive promoter. The presence (or absence) of E-cadherin regulates the expression of the transcription factor T-brachyury, indicating that cadherins play a role in linking cell surface receptors and gene expression. Comparative analysis of the parental and the genetically altered ES cell lines was performed to examine cell differentiation and the capability to form organized tissues. While differentiating E-cadherin-/- ES cells are still able to express various early and late differentiation markers, they show a clear-cut deficiency in forming organized structures. This phenotype can be rescued by constitutive expression of E-cadherin, which results exclusively in formation of epithelia. In contrast, rescue transfectants expressing N-cadherin show no epithelial structures, instead forming neuroepithelium and cartilage. These results provide the first evidence that specific cadherins directly stimulate differentiation into certain types of tissues.</str>

      <str>Elucidation of macroevolutionary transitions between diverse animal body plans remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. We address the sponge-eumetazoan transition by analyzing expression of a broad range of eumetazoan developmental regulatory genes in Sycon ciliatum (Calcispongiae). Here we show that many members of surprisingly numerous Wnt and Tgfβ gene families are expressed higher or uniquely in the adult apical end and the larval posterior end. Genes involved in formation of the eumetazoan endomesoderm, such as β-catenin, Brachyury and Gata, as well as germline markers Vasa and Pl10, are expressed during formation and maintenance of choanoderm, the feeding epithelium of sponges. Similarity in developmental gene expression between sponges and eumetazoans, especially cnidarians, is consistent with Haeckel's view that body plans of sponges and cnidarians are homologous. These results provide a framework for further studies aimed at deciphering ancestral developmental regulatory networks and their modifications during animal body plans evolution. </str>

      <str>To take advantage of the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it is necessary to regulate their differentiation in response to defined factors. In this study, in order to explore novel molecules that regulate the differentiation of ESCs, we investigated whether collagen hydrolysate, collagen-characteristic amino acids, glycine (Gly), l-proline and trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (l-Hyp); or dipeptides, proline-hydroxyproline and hydroxyproline-glycine regulate the differentiation of mouse embryoid bodies (EBs). We identified that treatment with collagen hydrolysate or Gly repressed the expression of the mesendodermal markers, Brachyury and Foxa2 in EBs and maintained the undifferentiated state of mESCs in a feeder-free monolayer culture. In contrast, l-Hyp promoted the expression of Brachyury, Mixl1, Gsc and Foxa2 in EBs. And the treatment with l-Hyp promoted cardiac differentiation within EBs, which was proven by the spontaneous contraction of cardiomyocytes and the expression of the cardiac markers, α-MHC, MLC-2v and Nkx2.5.

      <str>During embryogenesis, left-right sidedness is established by asymmetric expression of laterality genes. A recent model predicts the presence of a functional midline that divides the left side of the embryonic disc from the right side, separating left- and right-inducing signals. We show evidence that this midline is formed from a distinct population of cells within the primitive streak. Cells in the dorsal midline of the chick primitive streak display unique expression of the gastrulation markers fgf-8 and brachyury. These midline cells are fated to die, and dead cells remain in the midline during gastrulation. Inhibition of midline cell death compromises the early expression of laterality genes, such as shh and nodal and randomizes the direction of heart looping. We suggest that cell death along the primitive streak midline is a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of left-right asymmetry during early embryogenesis.</str>

      <str>Goosecoid (Gsc), a paired-like homeobox gene expressed in the vertebrate organizer, functions as a transcriptional repressor either by direct DNA binding to paired TAAT homeodomain sites or through recruitment by the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxh1. Here, we report that Gsc is post-translationally modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins (SUMO). Members of the PIAS family of proteins enhance Gsc sumoylation and this modification occurs on at least six lysine residues. Stable expression of a SUMO-defective Gsc mutant (Gsc 6Km) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells results in morphological changes giving rise to cells with increased cell area. We demonstrate that Gsc 6Km can effectively repress Foxh1-mediated induction of the Mixl1 promoter, indicating that sumoylation is not required for Gsc-mediated repression of promoters where recruitment occurs through Foxh1. In contrast, Gsc 6Km exhibits a decreased ability to repress the induction of promoters to which it is directly recruited through paired-homeodomain binding sites, including its own promoter and that of the Xenopus Brachyury gene. Taken together, our data suggests that regulation of Gsc repressive activity by SUMO modification is promoter specific and may serve to differentially regulate genes that function to control cell morphology during early development and cancer.</str>

      <str>Long-term results of complete removal of vertebrae with a minimum follow-up period of seven years are reported in 23 consecutive patients from March 1968 to January 1981. Seven patients were treated with vertebrectomy above the sacrum: three for a giant-cell tumor (T11, T12, and L1; T11; and L4), one for chondrosarcoma (one-half T6, T7, and one-half T8), one for chordoma (L3), one for plasmocytoma (L1), and one for a metastasis of renal carcinoma (L1). The latter two patients eventually died of generalized disease, whereas the other five patients have no evidence of tumor after seven to 20 years. In the six patients in whom the spine was reconstructed using corticocancellous iliac bone, a block-vertebra was created by the grafts and the adjacent vertebrae, allowing two women to complete one or more pregnancies successfully. Sixteen patients were treated with removal of sacral vertebrae (from one-half S3, S4, and S5 to all). None of the seven patients treated with adequate surgery for a sacral chordoma has had a local recurrence. Two women have given birth to children after sacral amputations, one performed for rhabdomyosarcoma and the other for a huge ganglioneuroma.

      <str>We reviewed the pertinent literature for this study.</str>
      <str>Skull base chordomas usually arise in the clivus and are rarely completely resectable. Therefore, most are treated with radiotherapy (RT). Because of the risk of severe late complications, the dose is often limited with conventional photon RT, and the probability of cure is low. Proton RT alone or combined with photon RT (proton/photon RT) offers the advantage of improved dose distribution and the ability to treat the tumor to a higher dose without exceeding normal tissue tolerance. The 10-year local control rate after proton/photon RT is approximately 40% to 50%. The probability of local control is related to minimum tumor dose and dose inhomogeneity.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare neoplasms of notochordal origin that arise along the vertebral axis. In the cervicofacial area, they show a marked proclivity for the sphenooccipital region. These slow-growing and infiltrating tumors are often discovered because of neglected symptoms related to the ENT field such as nasal obstruction, snoring, dyspnea or dysphagia in the case of anterior development, serous otitis media, cervical pain, or even palsy of the X, XI, or XII cranial nerves when the tumor develops toward the foramen jugulare or the foramen magnum. Prognosis is usually poor because of local malignancy, proximity to critical central nervous system structures, and volume of the tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment for these extradural tumors, but most authors recommend postoperative irradiation because of surgical spillage or residual tumor. However, conventional irradiation is limited by the sensitivity of surrounding structures, which results in a poor rate of local control. We present 9 cases of histologically proven diagnosis of chordoma treated from 1984 to 1994 at our institution. Prognosis and therapeutic modalities are discussed. Therapeutic improvement might be brought the protontherapie, which ensures a better local control, and therefore may transform the prognosis of the disease.</str>

      <str>Primary malignant tumors of the spine are relatively rare, less than 5% of all spinal column tumors. However, these lesions are often among the most difficult to treat and encompass challenging pathologies such as chordoma and a variety of invasive sarcomas. The mechanisms of tumor recurrence after surgical intervention, as well as resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, remain a pervasive and costly problem. Recent evidence has emerged supporting the hypothesis that solid tumors contain a sub-population of cancer cells that possess characteristics normally associated with stem cells. Particularly, the potential for long-term proliferation appears to be restricted to subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) functionally defined by their capacity to self-renew and give rise to differentiated cells that phenotypically recapitulate the original tumor, thereby causing relapse and patient death. These cancer stem cells present a unique opportunity to better understand the biology of solid tumors in general, as well as targets for future therapeutics. The general objective of the current study is to discuss the fundamental concepts for understanding the role of CSCs with respect to chemoresistance, radioresistance, special cell surface markers, cancer recurrence and metastasis in tumors of the osseous spine. This discussion is followed by a specific review of what is known about the role of CSCs in chordoma, the most common primary malignant osseous tumor of the spine. </str>

      <str>We present the clinical outcome of five patients who had reconstruction of large osseous defects in the iliosacral region after excision of aggressive bone tumors using pedicled-or free-vascularized iliac bone grafts. Surgical margin, incidence of recurrence and metastasis, patient survival, time to bone union, and postoperative function were evaluated. Limb-salvage surgery resulted in wide excisions in two patients with giant-cell tumors of bone and chordoma, respectively, a marginal excision in one patient with a schwannoma, and intralesional excisions to preserve nerve roots in two patients with giant-cell tumors. There was no recurrence at final followup in any of the patients. Bone union required an average of 5.4 months. The postoperative functional results were excellent in all patients except for the patient with a chordoma. In one of the patients with a giant-cell tumor, the screws and rod were removed partially because of skin necrosis in the instrumentation area. This technique is considered a good alternative for reconstruction of a large osseous defect in the pelvis because graft harvest is relatively simple and rapid, especially if a pedicled iliac bone transfer is performed.</str>

Cervical spine chordomas pose special challenges because of the vertebral arteries and critical nerve roots involved. Multilevel chordomas pose even greater challenges because of the need to remove multiple segments of the spine in 1 piece without tumor violation. Although there have been 2 case reports describing multilevel spondylectomy for cervical chordoma, to the authors' knowledge, there are no reports of parasagittal osteotomies for en bloc resection of multilevel cervical chordomas. The use of these osteotomies allows us to avoid intralesional resection and adhere to the oncological principle of en bloc tumor excision.

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors of neuroectodermal origin and often show a very heterogeneous histological picture. In a combined histochemical and immunohistochemical study of 32 chordomas collected in the Bone Tumor Registry of Westphalia we were able to show that the immunoreactivity of the cells in both chordoma and notochordal structures are in close relationship with the extracellular matrix and depends more on the metabolic activity of these cells than on the origin of the cells of the neuroectoderm. All tumor cells show a bimodal immunoreaction with cytokeratin and vimentin, as well as a strong immunoreaction with the oncofetal markers CEA and AFP. The differentiation of chordomas from other malignant tumors, mainly the myxoid variant of chondrosarcoma, may cause major difficulties, especially if only a little biopsy material is available. Here we can see that in tumors with bimodal immunoexpression of vimentin and cytokeratin, as can be found in chordomas, the further use of antibodies offers a reliable differential diagnostic tool. The positive reaction of chordomas with all epithelial tumor markers offers a clear differentiation from chondrosarcomas, which, unlike chordomas, do not express cytokeratin. The identification of a marker profile by employing common antisera is of major value in the differentiation of chordoma from other epithelial or mesenchymal tumors.</str>

All patients underwent surgery and an histologic examination of the surgical specimen was carried out. CT always allowed to detect the sacro-coccygeal neoplasm, which looked like a solid non-homogeneous mass; in 50% of cases coarse calcifications were found. CT made it possible to evaluate the growing side of the tumor, its relation with the adjacent anatomical structures-especially the longitudinal extension and the involvement of the sacral hiatus; these findings proved to be very useful in order to choose the most appropriate surgical technique. CT findings also suggested the nature of the tumor but rarely allowed a definitive diagnosis. CT is, at any rate, mandatory in order to evaluate the real extent of the tumor and to plan surgery.</str>

      <str>Chordoma originates from embryonic notochordal remnants in the midline along the spinal axis and is characterized by cords and lobules of neoplastic cells arranged within myxoid matrix. Because of histologic similarities with myxoid matrix and overlapping immunohistochemical profile, chondrosarcoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, and chordoid meningioma enter in the histologic differential diagnosis at this site. Therefore, the judicious use of a panel of selected immunostains is unquestionably helpful in diagnostically challenging cases. To find useful immunohistochemical markers for assisting in differential diagnosis between chordoma and other tumors with chordoid morphology, an immunohistochemical study using D2-40, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), pan-cytokeratin (panCK), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 protein, galectin-3, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), beta-catenin, E-cadherin, and carcinoembryonic antigen was performed on 14 chordomas, 7 chondrosarcomas, 9 myxopapillary ependymomas, and 4 chordoid meningiomas. Chordoma typically showed positive for EMA and panCK and negative for D2-40 and GFAP; whereas chondrosarcoma revealed positive for D2-40, and negative for EMA, panCK, and GFAP; myxopapillary ependymoma positive for GFAP and negative for EMA; and chordoid meningioma positive for EMA, and negative for panCK and GFAP. On the basis of our immunohistochemical study, a panel of D2-40, EMA, panCK, and GFAP allowed the correct recognition of all tumors examined. Other immunohistochemical markers including S-100 protein, galectin-3, NCAM, beta-catenin, E-cadherin, and carcinoembryonic antigen were of little value in differential diagnosis. In summary, the best immunohistochemical markers useful for the evaluation of tumors with chordoid morphology were D2-40, EMA, cytokeratin, and GFAP. D2-40 was a true chondroid marker to be useful for the differential diagnosis with chordoma.</str>

      <str>Formation of the chordate body is accomplished by a complex set of morphogenetic movements including convergent extension of notochord cells. In the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury plays a key role in the formation of the notochord, and more than 30 Bra-downstream notochord genes have been identified. In the present study, we examined the effects of functional suppression of nine Bra-downstream notochord genes, which include Ci-PTP, Ci-ACL, Ci-prickle, Ci-netrin, Ci-trop, Ci-Noto3, Ci-ASAK, Ci-ERM and Ci-pellino. When the function of the first two genes (Ci-PTP and Ci-ACL) was suppressed with specific morpholinos, the notochord cells failed to converge, while functional suppression of Ci-prickle resulted in a failure of intercalation, and therefore the cells in these three types of embryo remained in the mid-dorsal region of the embryo. Functional suppression of the next four genes (Ci-netrin, Ci-trop, Ci-Noto3 and Ci-ASAK) resulted in the partial defect of intercalation, and the notochord did not consist of a single row. In addition, when the function of the last two genes (Ci-ERM and Ci-pellino) was suppressed, notochord cells failed to elongate in the embryo, even though convergence/extension took place normally. These results indicate that many Bra-downstream notochord genes are involved in convergence/extension of the embryo.</str>

      <str>The notochord has two major roles during chordate embryogenesis, as a source of inductive signals for the patterning of neural tube and paraxial mesoderm and as a supportive organ of the larval tail. Despite the recent identification of mutations that affect the notochord development in vertebrate embryos, little is known about genes that are expressed in the differentiating notochord itself. In the urochordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury (Ci-Bra) plays a key role in notochord differentiation. In a previous study, we isolated cDNA clones for nearly 40 potential Ci-Bra target genes that are expressed in notochord cells (H. Takahashi et al., 1999, Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). Here we characterized 20 of them by determining the complete nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs. These genes encode a broad spectrum of divergent proteins associated with notochord formation and function. Two genes encode ascidian homologs of the Drosophila Prickle LIM domain proteins and another encodes the ERM protein, all 3 of which appear to be involved in the control of cytoskeletal architecture. In addition, genes for netrin, leprecan, cdc45, ATP:citrate lyase, ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase, beta4-galactosyltransferase, fibrinogen-like protein, divergent tropomyosin-like proteins, and Drosophila Pellino-like protein were identified. The observation of the netrin gene expression in the notochord may provide the first molecular evidence that the ascidian notochord is a source of signals as in vertebrates. In addition, the present information should be used to identify nonchordate deuterostome tissues homologous to the notochord as well as genes which are expressed in the notochord cells of vertebrate embryos.</str>

      <str>Mouse embryos that are homozygous for the Brachyury (T) deletion die at mid-gestation. They have prominent defects in the notochord, the allantois and the primitive streak. Expression of the T gene commences at the onset of gastrulation and is restricted to the primitive streak, mesoderm emerging from the streak, the head process and the notochord. Genetic evidence has suggested that there may be an increasing demand for T gene function along the rostrocaudal axis. Experiments reported here indicate that this may not be the case. Instead, the gradient in severity of the T defect may be caused by defective mesoderm cell movements, which result in a progressive accumulation of mesoderm cells near the primitive streak. Embryonic stem (ES) cells which are homozygous for the T deletion have been isolated and their differentiation in vitro and in vivo compared with that of heterozygous and wild-type ES cell lines. In +/+&lt;--&gt;T/T ES cell chimeras the Brachyury phenotype is not rescued by the presence of wild-type cells and high level chimeras show most of the features characteristic of intact T/T mutants. A few offspring from blastocysts injected with T/T ES cells have been born, several of which had greatly reduced or abnormal tails. However, little or no ES cell contribution was detectable in these animals, either as coat colour pigmentation or by isozyme analysis. Inspection of potential +/+&lt;--&gt;T/T ES cell chimeras on the 11th or 12th day of gestation, stages later than that at which intact T/T mutants die, revealed the presence of chimeras with caudal defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Vertebrate germ layer development is an intricately interwoven process with the organism operating as an integrated whole. To examine these processes we have used embryonic stem (ES) cell in vitro differentiation in a serum-free, chemically defined medium (CDM). In CDM, ES cells differentiate as embryoid bodies to neuroectoderm with upregulation of pax-6, without commensurate expression of Brachyury. In the presence of Activin A, pax-6 and Brachyury mRNAs are readily detectable, suggestive of both neuroectoderm and mesoderm formation, while in the presence of BMP-4 a process resembling primitive streak formation at the molecular level occurs. Neuroectoderm development in CDM alone is consistent with the view that this process can occur by default, as reported in Xenopus, due to the absence or sequestration of mesoderm-inducing factors. Additionally, these data show that BMP-4 alone is capable of instigating a process resembling primitive streak formation in ES cells and possibly in vivo.</str>

      <str>During limb development, several signaling centers organize limb pattern. One of these, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), is critical for proximodistal limb outgrowth mediated by FGFs. Signals from the underlying mesoderm, including WNTs and FGFs, regulate early steps of AER induction. Ectodermal factors, particularly En1, play a critical role in regulating morphogenesis of a mature, compact AER along the distal limb apex, from a broad ventral ectodermal precursor domain. Contribution of mesodermal factors to the morphogenesis of a mature AER is less clear. We previously noted that the chick T gene (Brachyury), the prototypical T-box transcription factor, is expressed in the limb bud as well as axial mesoderm and primitive streak. Here we show that T is expressed in lateral plate mesoderm at the onset of limb bud formation and subsequently in the subridge mesoderm beneath the AER. Retroviral misexpression of T in chick results in anterior extension of the AER and subsequent limb phenotypes consistent with augmented AER extent and function. Analysis of markers for functional AER in mouse T(-/-) null mutant limb buds reveals disrupted AER morphogenesis. Our data also suggest that FGF and WNT signals may operate both upstream and downstream of T. Taken together, the results show that T plays a role in the regulation of AER formation, particularly maturation, and suggest that T may also be a component of the epithelialmesenchymal regulatory loop involved in maintenance of a mature functioning AER.</str>

      <str>To study the local infiltration length of spinal bone giant cell tumor and chordoma in various para-tumorous tissues.</str>
      <str>Surgical specimens from 7 patients with bone giant cell tumor and 10 patients with chordoma were divided into 6 groups: cortical bone group (CBG, para-tumorous tissue is bone cortex with periosteum), cartilage group (CG, para-tumorous tissues contain intervertebral disc, cartilage endplate and facet joint cartilage), trabecular bone group (TBG), paraspinal muscle tissue group (MTG), adipose tissue group (ATG) and scar tissue group (STG). Macroscopically margin (MSM) in the fresh specimens, histological margin (HLM) in the H&amp;E sections and molecular margin (MCM) in the immunohistochemical staining sections were measured respectively. Three types of the margins of each group and MSM-HLMs, and MSM-MCMs among all groups were compared.</str>
      <str>Analysis of Variance comparing MSM, HLM and MCM within each group showed that there were significant differences in all groups (P &lt; 0.05) except for CBG and CG. MSMs were significantly longer than HLMs and MCMs in TBG and MTG (P &lt; 0.05), and MSMs were significantly longer than MCMs in ATG and STG (P &lt; 0.05). MSM-HLMs and MSM-MCMs of TBG and ATG were significantly larger than those of CG and CBG. MSM-HLMs and MSM-MCMs of MTG and STG were significantly larger than those of CG; in addition, MSM-MCM of STG was significantly larger than CBG's. The maximum of tumor infiltration length in CBG, MTG, ATG and STG were 11.68 mm, 13.08 mm, 8.64 mm and 9.98 mm respectively.</str>
      <str>Each vertebra can be seen as a compartment, so total spondylectomy is an optimal procedure when bone giant cell tumor and chordoma localized in the compartment. To achieve a wide resection, a 1.3 cm wide margin in para-tumorous cancellous bone, a 1.5 cm wide margin in para-tumorous muscle and 1.0 cm wide margin in adipose tissues are necessary. First-time resection should be more aggressive and avoid tumor cell contamination. The surgical extent of salvage revision should contain para-tumorous scar tissue with the margin no less than 1.0 cm.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordomas are rare, locally aggressive, notochord-derived neoplasms for which prognostically relevant biomarkers are not well established.</str>
      <str>To evaluate whether newly discovered molecular alterations in chordomas have prognostic significance similar to what has been described regarding Ki-67 proliferation index.</str>
      <str>We conducted a retrospective study of 28 cases of primary clival chordomas.</str>
      <str>Ki-67 proliferation index 5% or more, p53 accumulation, and epidermal growth factor receptor expression were seen in 32%, 44%, and 8% of chordomas, respectively. 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and/or 1p36 hemizygous deletion was seen in 30% of tumors, while 9p LOH and/or 9p21 homozygous deletion was seen in 21% of cases. Loss of heterozygosity at 10q23 and 17p13 were identified in 57% and 52% of cases, respectively. Ki-67 proliferation index 5% or more and 9p LOH were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival, while homozygous deletion at 9p21 via fluorescence in situ hybridization approached significance. No correlation with survival was found for p53 or epidermal growth factor receptor expression, 1p36 hemizygous deletion, or LOH at 1p, 10q23, or 17p13.</str>
      <str>Chordomas with elevated Ki-67 proliferation index or deletion at 9p21 may be at risk for a more aggressive clinical course and shorter survival. These biomarkers may thus be used to improve therapeutic stratification.</str>

      <str>During the molluscan evolution leading to the bivalves, the single dorsal shell was doubled. To elucidate the molecular developmental basis underlying this prominent morphological transition, we described the cell cleavage and expression patterns of three genes, brachyury, engrailed, and dpp in the Japanese spiny oyster Saccostrea kegaki, and examined the function of dpp in this species. The cleavage pattern of the S. kegaki embryo was nearly the same as the previously described pattern of other bivalve species, suggesting that the pattern itself is highly important for the establishment or the maintenance of the bivalve body plan. The expression pattern of a brachyury homolog in S. kegaki (SkBra) was similar to the pattern in gastopods even at the single cell level despite the deep divergence of gastropods and bivalves. Engrailed and dpp were previously found to be expressed around the shell anlagen in gastropods. Like that of gastropods, an engrailed homolog in S. kegaki (SkEn) was found to be expressed around the shell anlagen. However, the dpp homologin S. kegaki (SkDpp) was expressed only in the cells along the dorsal midline. ZfBMP4 treatment experiments revealed the importance of dpp in establishing the characteristic shape of the bivalve shell anlagen.</str>

      <str>Mammalian Argonaute proteins (EIF2C1-4) play an essential role in RNA-induced silencing. Here, we show that the loss of eIF2C2 (Argonaute2 or Ago2) results in gastrulation arrest, ectopic expression of Brachyury (T), and mesoderm expansion. We identify a genetic interaction between Ago2 and T, as Ago2 haploinsufficiency partially rescues the classic T/+ short-tail phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that the ectopic T expression and concomitant mesoderm expansion result from disrupted fibroblast growth factor signaling, likely due to aberrant expression of Eomesodermin. Together, these data indicate that a factor best known as a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex is required for proper fibroblast growth factor signaling during gastrulation, suggesting a possible micro-RNA function in the formation of a mammalian germ layer.</str>

      <str>Gene trapping is a powerful method for identifying novel genes and for analyzing their functions. It is, however, difficult to select trapped genes on the basis of their function. To identify genes regulated by transcription factors that are important in the mesodermal formation, we selected trapped ES clones by infection of adenoviral vectors expressing Pax1, Brachyury, and Foxa2. Among 366 trapped genes, seven seemed to be controlled by these transcription factors in the first screening. The trapped genes were identified by 5' RACE, and a Northern blotting revealed that expressions of three trapped genes were regulated by these transcription factors. Expression patterns of Cx43 and HP1gamma implicated their functional relationships to Foxa2 in the formation of the notochord and the neural tube. Furthermore, Wtap mutant mice derived from the trapped clone showed defects in the mesendoderm formation. Our results indicate that trapped ES clones could be selected effectively using transcription factors.</str>

      <str>The ascidian tadpole larva is regarded as a prototype of the ancestral chordate. Here we consider recent studies on the development of the tadpole larva that provide new insights into chordate origins and evolution. The notochord of ascidian larvae and vertebrates appear to be homologous structures based on their induction by endoderm and expression of the Brachyury (T) gene. The muscle cells of ascidian larvae also appear homologous to those of vertebrates based on their expression of bHLH myogenic and muscle-type actin genes, although they are specified by cytoplasmic determinants localized in the egg as well as embryonic induction. Studies of the tailless larvae of anural ascidians have resulted in the identification of Manx, a gene that may control tail development and evolution. These and other results support the ascidian tadpole prototype for the ancestral chordate.</str>

      <str>Gene expression during gastrulation in porcine embryos has been sparsely studied, but there are indications that species-specific patterns exist. Here, we investigated the three-dimensional (3D) expression of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (T) and the forkhead box transcription factor FOXA2 by immunocytochemistry in porcine peri-gastrulation embryos. The first T(+) cells were detected in posterior epiblast of ovoid blastocysts. Later T(+) FOXA2(-) cells were found in the posterior primitive streak (PS) and nascent mesoderm, T(+) FOXA2(+) cells in the anterior PS, probably identifying the organizer region, and T(-) FOXA2(+) cells anterior to this region. In embryos with a neural groove, T and FOXA2 were co-expressed in the node and notochord, FOXA2 was expressed in the floor plate and posteriorly T was expressed in the streak. In all developmental stages, FOXA2 was expressed in the entire hypoblast/definitive endoderm. We conclude that the expression pattern of T and FOXA2 is largely conserved between pig and mouse.</str>

Nineteen of 20 GISTs expressed DOG-1 and 12 of 20 were diffusely positive (≥95%) with moderate to strong intensity. There was focal, predominantly luminal staining of colorectal (three of 10), endometrioid (four of 10) and acinic cell carcinomas (four of five). One case each of spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma (2+), schwannoma (trace) and MPNST (2+) showed DOG-1 expression.</str>

      <str>In routine surgical practice, anterior approaches are not often used to treat upper cervical pathologies. Such lesions can be difficult to access surgically. This article describes 2 cases in which the transmandibular approach was used to address anterior upper cervical pathology. One case was a chordoma invading the C2-C3 vertebrae and the other case was atlanto-axial instability. Neurological examination revealed myelopathy in both cases. Each patient had already undergone occipito-cervical fusion at a different center and, thus, had limited neck extension and mouth-opening ability. In the first case, the tumor was totally excised. In the second, the dens was removed. We believe that the transmandibular approach is the best option for patients with limited neck mobility and restricted mouth-opening ability.</str>

      <str>The myxoid variant of chondrosarcoma is usually seen in soft tissues where it is known as chordoid sarcoma or parachordoma. Rarely, it involves bone and when it does, cranial bones are the preferred location. This tumor is frequently amalgamated with the chondroid variant of chordoma, especially when the lesion occurs in the sphenoid bone/spheno-occipital region, because of their similar clinical presentations, anatomical locations, radiological findings, and mistaken histopathological features. It is essential to distinguish myxoid chondrosarcoma from the chondroid variant of chordoma, because of the different treatment protocol and prognostic importance. We present such a location-based diagnostic dilemma, solved successfully with ancillary immunohistochemistry.</str>

However, there is no correlation between the roentgenogram and the dignity of the tumor. The best therapy is the radical operation.

As discussed in the earlier part of the review, both benign and malignant types of these tumors affect the adult and the pediatric population, and an understanding of their subtleties may increase their effective resection. In this review, we discuss the epidemiologic, histological, and imaging features of the most common locally aggressive primary vertebral tumors (chordoma and giant-cell tumor) and malignant tumors (chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma, and osteosarcoma). The figures used for illustration are from operative patients of the senior authors (Z.L.G. and J.H.C.).

      <str>Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects.</str>

      <str>Clear cell meningioma (CCM) is a peculiar variant that differs from conventional meningioma in affecting younger patients, arising more often in spinal or cerebellopontine locations, and showing a higher recurrence rate. Classical meningothelial areas are scarce in these tumors and the differential diagnosis with other neoplasms, particularly metastatic carcinoma, is often difficult. We report a case of clear cell meningioma from the lumbosacral spine in which location, radiologic presentation, light microscopic appearance in initial sampling, and some of the ultrastructural findings were reminiscent of chordoma. The tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and very focally positive for epithelial membrane antigen. Ultrastructural demonstration of interdigitating cell processes joined by numerous desmosomes confirmed the diagnosis of CCM.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare neoplasm which arises from the embryonic remnant of the notochord. The paper reported 24 cases of chordomas in the skull base. According to symptoms, signs, imaging features, operation findings, the original places and the expansive directions of the tumor, they were divided into four clinical types: sellar, clival, occipito-temporal and extent. The choices of surgical approaches were suggested on these types. They are difficult to remove because of their deep site, limit operative field and close to the important vessels, nerves and brain, and they recur frequently after operation.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is an exceedingly rare tumor, marked by a slow growth rate. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but the most frequent sites of origin (spine and skull base) make treatment of primary disease challenging. Local relapses affect more than 50% of cases, with a minority of patients being cured by further surgery. Furthermore, metastases occur in at least 20% of patients. For residual or recurrent disease, high-dose radiation therapy may be indicated. Radiation therapy is currently the preferred local treatment when surgery is problematic, exploiting most recent techniques, including proton beams and carbon ions. However, systemic therapy is needed in patients non-amenable to surgery and/or radiation therapy. We reviewed systemic treatments currently available, and targets possibly druggable in the future in this orphan disease.</str>

      <str>Chondrosarcoma of the skull base is a rare neoplasm. The most common presenting symptoms are hoarseness, dysphagia, and diplopia, which is associated with palsies of cranial nerves X, IX, and VI. The temporal bone is the most common site of tumor origin, followed by the sphenoid bone. These tumors must be differentiated from chordoma, chondroid chordoma, osteogenic sarcoma, enchondroma, and meningioma. Diagnosis is made by patient history, radiologic imaging, and biopsy. The treatment is surgical excision followed by radiation therapy. Five-year survival rates for grades I, II, and III are 90, 81, and 43%, respectively.</str>

Although considered not to possess significant metastatic potential, such lesions are locally aggressive, leading to neurologic compromise and lytic destruction of bone. En bloc resection has afforded patients the greatest chance of local control and disease-free survival. Such radical resections may be associated with significant surgical morbidity, however.

      <str>The notochord plays a critical role in organizing and directing vertebral development. In humans, most notochordal cells are eventually sequestered into the nucleus pulposus and disappear within the first decade of life. Although notochordal remnants and related lesions have been described in the axial skeleton of adults, their presence in intervertebral disks is rare. We describe herein 3 cases of incidental notochordal remnants identified in surgically removed adult intervertebral disks. Their histologic features were reminiscent of notochordal vestiges in the fetus. However, they raised the differential diagnosis of benign notochordal cell tumor and chordoma. Notochordal rests can be a source of diagnostic confusion and should be distinguished from notochordal neoplasms because they do not necessitate resection or other forms of therapy.</str>

Chordomas are rare and unique bony tumors that arise along the neural axis and are thought to originate from the nucleus pulposus.

      <str>Plain radiographs of seven patients with sacrococcygeal chordomas showed sacral destruction, enlarged sacral neural foramina, and, usually, a presacral mass. Conventional tomograms clarified these bone abnormalities, which were often poorly visible on the plain radiographs. Two radionuclide bone scans showed increased peripheral uptake around the lesion, and one showed decreased uptake in the area of destroyed bone. Angiograms demonstrated only vessel displacement, and barium enemas showed only displacement of bowel by large soft tissue masses. Five myelograms were normal. Adequate surgical treatment of sacral chordomas requires a wide radical resection that avoids contaminating the wound with tumor. Therefore, thorough preoperative radiologic evaluation of the anatomic extent of a chordoma is essential. Although computed tomograms in three patients provided the best delineation of the total extent of bone and soft tissue involvement, tumor extension into gluteal muscles and other tissues eluded radiographic detection. The widespread infiltrative growth pattern along soft tissue planes and nerves and into vessels, undetectable by the above listed studies, mandates a cautious approach and a wide surgical margin, to prevent wound contamination and subsequent recurrence.</str>

      <str>A series of 15 patients affected with chordoma localized in the clivus and the vertebral column treated surgically by a single surgeon were studied. Localizations in the proximal segments of the spine (clivus and cervical spine) become clinically evident earlier. Diagnosis and consequent treatment are carried out during a stage of progression that is less advanced than occurs in chordomas with lumbar and sacral localization. Based on a study of the material examined it may be observed that factors influencing prognosis are related to the phase of progression of the disease (stage of the tumor), site, whether or not previous surgery has been performed. The type of surgical resection varies in relation to the site of the lesion, at times allowing for wide margin resections. The progressive course of the tumor is positively influenced by early diagnosis, currently favored by progress made in the field of neuroradiology, surgical resection performed according to oncological criteria, and conventional high-dosage radiation therapy, with fractioned doses.</str>

It is usually present on the midline cerebrospinal axis and the most common locations are the spheno-clival region and the sacrum.

Sacral tumors may present a difficult problem to the surgeon who desires to obtain a clear margin of excision. Using the retrorectal fat tissue as a cleavage line in the posterior approach guides the neurosurgeon to resect the tumor totally and reduce the hemorrhage in sacral chordomas.

The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis.

      <str>Excision is the treatment of choice in cases of sacral chordoma. Local recurrences, however, have often been observed even after total en bloc resection. The authors assessed outcomes in four cases of tumor recurrence in patients who underwent total en bloc S2-3 resection for sacral chordomas that were located below S-3. The primary recurrences were located at either side of the lateral portion of the remaining sacrum in all patients. In two patients in whom preoperative magnetic resonance imaging indicated no invasion of the tumor into surrounding soft tissues, recurrence in the resected end of the gluteus maximus or piriformis muscle was also observed. The authors therefore recommend that the S2-3 sacrectomy should be performed over an adequate margin, including a part of sacroiliac joints at the bilateral portions of the sacrum and soft tissues such as the gluteus maximus or piriformis muscle.</str>

      <str>Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are classified as either seminomas or nonseminomas. Both tumors originate from carcinoma in situ (CIS) cells, which are derived from transformed fetal gonocytes. CIS, seminoma, and the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma (EC) retain an embryonic phenotype and express pluripotency factors (NANOG/OCT4). Vitamin D (VD) is metabolized in the testes, and here, we examined VD metabolism in TGCT differentiation and pluripotency regulation. We established that the VD receptor (VDR) and VD-metabolizing enzymes are expressed in human fetal germ cells, CIS, and invasive TGCTs. VD metabolism diminished markedly during the malignant transformation from CIS to EC but was reestablished in differentiated components of nonseminomas, distinguished by coexpression of mesodermal markers and loss of OCT4. Subsequent in vitro studies confirmed that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (active VD) downregulated NANOG and OCT4 through genomic VDR activation in EC-derived NTera2 cells and, to a lesser extent, in seminoma-derived TCam-2 cells, and up-regulated brachyury, SNAI1, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and fibroblast growth factor 23. To test for a possible therapeutic effect in vivo, NTera2 cells were xenografted into nude mice and treated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), which induced down-regulation of pluripotency factors but caused no significant reduction of tumor growth. During NTera2 tumor formation, down-regulation of VDR was observed, resulting in limited responsiveness to cholecalciferol and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment in vivo. These novel findings show that VD metabolism is involved in the mesodermal transition during differentiation of cancer cells with embryonic stem cell characteristics, which points to a function for VD during early embryonic development and possibly in the pathogenesis of TGCTs.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a malignant neoplasm believed to arise from notochord remnants. It accounts for approximately 3 to 4 p. 100 of primary bone tumors and is localized along the axial skeleton, 50 p. 100 being sacrococcygeal. Clinical, radiographical and histological findings have been well established since the first description by Ribbert in 1894. Sacral chordomas are however difficult to manage and remain a challenge for surgeons and radiotherapists alike. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of surgical treatment and patterns of failure in patients treated for chordoma of the sacrum in our department.</str>
      <str>This retrospective study included 11 cases of sacral chordomas treated from 1973 to 1998. Patient age ranged from 36 to 77 years (mean 59 years). Six patients were female and five male. The initial treatment was surgery in all cases including intralesional removal in two cases, marginal resection in seven and complete en bloc resection in two.</str>
      <str>Median follow-up was 6 years (1 month to 14 years). Tumoral recurrences were observed in nine cases 5 months to 8 years after treatment. In two cases, recurrence was observed 8 years after radical sacrectomy. Treatment of recurrences was partial surgical removal with radiotherapy (40 to 70 Grays). Three patients developed metastases in lungs, liver and bone, respectively. Seven patients died, two from metastatic disease. The 5-year overall survival was 64 p. 100 but only 18 p. 100 of the patients survived 10 years. Average disease-free survival was 18 p. 100 at 5 years and 0 p. 100 at 10 years.</str>
      <str>Chordoma is a slow-growing tumor allowing survival for several years despite recurrent disease. However, only 10 to 20 p. 100 of the patients survive free of disease at 5 years. Recurrences are frequent (45 to 80 p. 100) and often multiple. Chordoma inevitably recurs and eventually leads to death after intralesional removal or marginal resection. Radical surgery should be attempted whenever technically feasible. When performed early, particularly for smaller lesions, it offers the best chance for cure. However, tumoral recurrence can occur postoperatively despite a macroscopically complete resection. Because radiation therapy seems to be more successful in controlling microscopic disease, it should be considered as a pre- or postoperative adjuvant to a macroscopically complete resection.</str>

      <str>To investigate dosimetric errors in proton therapy treatment planning due to titanium implants, and to determine how these affect postoperative passively scattered proton therapy for chordoma patients with orthopedic hardware.</str>
      <str>The presence of titanium hardware near the tumor may affect the dosimetric accuracy of proton therapy. Artifacts in the computed tomography (CT) scan can cause errors in the proton stopping powers used for dose calculation, which are derived from CT numbers. Also, clinical dose calculation algorithms may not accurately simulate proton beam transport through the implants, which have very different properties as compared to human tissue. The authors first evaluated the impact of these two main issues. Dose errors introduced by metal artifacts were studied using phantoms with and without titanium inserts, and patient scans on which a metal artifact reduction method was applied. Pencil-beam dose calculations were compared to models of nuclear interactions in titanium and Monte Carlo simulations. Then, to assess the overall impact on treatment plans for chordoma, the authors compared the original clinical treatment plans to recalculated dose distributions employing both metal artifact reduction and Monte Carlo methods.</str>
      <str>Dose recalculations of clinical proton fields showed that metal artifacts cause range errors up to 6 mm distal to regions affected by CT artifacts. Monte Carlo simulations revealed dose differences &gt;10% in the high-dose area, and range differences up to 10 mm. Since these errors are mostly local in nature, the large number of fields limits the impact on target coverage in the chordoma treatment plans to a small decrease of dose homogeneity.</str>
      <str>In the presence of titanium implants, CT metal artifacts and the approximations of pencil-beam dose calculations cause considerable errors in proton dose calculation. The spatial distribution of the errors however limits the overall impact on passively scattered proton therapy for chordoma.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation in embryoid bodies (EBs) provides a valuable tool to study the interplay of different germ layers and their influence on cell differentiation. The gene expression of the developing EBs has been shown in many studies, but the protein expression and the spatial composition of different germ layers in human EBs have not been systematically studied. The aim of the present work was to study the temporal and spatial organisation of germ layers based on the expression of mesoderm (Brachyury T), endoderm (AFP) and ectoderm (SOX1) markers during the early stages of differentiation in eight hESC lines. Tissue multi-array technology was applied to study the protein expression of a large number of EBs. According to our results, EB formation and the organisation of germ layers occurred in a similar manner in all the lines. During 12 days of differentiation, all the germ layer markers were present, but no obvious distinct trajectories were formed. However, older EBs were highly organised in structure. Pluripotency marker OCT3/4 expression persisted unexpectedly long in the differentiating EBs. Cavity formation was observed in the immunocytological sections, and caspase-3 expression was high, suggesting a role of apoptosis in hESC differentiation and/or EB formation. The expression of Brachyury T was notably low in all the lines, also those with the best cardiac differentiation capacity, while the expression of SOX1 was higher in some lines, suggesting that the neural differentiation propensity may be detectable already in the early stages of EB differentiation.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is one of several similar appearing neoplasms in the retroperitoneum, pelvis, and abdomen with a combination of features including clear cells, with or without cytoplasmic vacuoles, papillary profiles, and a myxoid or myxohyaline stroma. The differential diagnosis of a cellular myxoid or mucinous tumor in a small biopsy, when the entire tumor is not available for pathologic examination, includes metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma of colorectal and other similar-appearing neoplasms, renal cell carcinoma, and myxopapillary ependymoma. We compared immunohistochemical reactivity of 18 chordomas with 20 colonic adenocarcinomas, 20 renal cell carcinomas, and six myxopapillary ependymomas using antibodies to vimentin, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein, Leu 7, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and carcinoembryonic antigen. All chordomas were immunoreactive for vimentin and cytokeratin, 83% for epithelial membrane antigen, and 83% for S100 protein. Myxopapillary ependymomas were distinguished by immunoreactivity for vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein in all cases and S100 protein in 50%. All colonic adenocarcinomas were positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Renal cell carcinomas were uniformly reactive for epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin, nonreactive for carcinoembryonic antigen, and variably reactive for S100 protein (5%) and vimentin (25%).

      <str>To report the first case of an ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome caused by a sacrococcygeal chordoma.</str>
      <str>We present a case report with clinical, laboratory, and histologic details.</str>
      <str>A 76-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of urinary obstruction. Five years previously, a urethral mass had been detected, and transurethral prostatectomy had been performed. Annual computed tomographic (CT) scans showed no change in size of the mass. In 1995, skin hyperpigmentation, central obesity, and bilateral edema were noted. The patient was admitted to the hospital in July 1996. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large mass close to the sacrum and compressing the bladder and rectum. Cortisol measurements (AM and PM) were 309 and 271 ng/mL, respectively. The plasma ACTH concentration was extremely elevated (3,125 pg/mL). Although resection of the mass was attempted, complete resection was not possible because the tumor had infiltrated the sacrum. Plasma cortisol concentrations in samples obtained 7 and 8 days postoperatively were normal. Plasma ACTH was substantially decreased (180 pg/mL) but remained above normal. The histologic features of the tumor were compatible with a chordoma. Neoplastic cells stained positively for ACTH.</str>
      <str>This report describes the first case of an ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by a sacrococcygeal chordoma. A slow progression of symptoms in an ectopic ACTH syndrome had been described only for carcinoid tumors. These data add a new entry to the list of neoplasms capable of causing this syndrome.</str>

      <str>To explore the antitumor activity of imatinib in patients with advanced platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFB)/PDGF receptor β (PDGFRB)-positive chordomas.</str>
      <str>In a collaborative Italian-Swiss, prospective, phase II clinical study conducted from November 2004 through April 2006, 56 patients with advanced PDGFB and/or PDGFRB chordoma received 800 mg/d of imatinib until progression. The primary end point was the overall tumor response rate (ORR), defined by RECIST. Secondary, exploratory end points included tissue response (ie, changes in tumor density or signal intensity/contrast enhancement, and/or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [PET] uptake), overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and pain score.</str>
      <str>Among 50 patients evaluable by RECIST, the best response was one partial response (PR) obtained at 6 months (ORR, 2%). There were 35 patients with stable disease (SD, 70%) and a 64% clinical benefit rate (ie, RECIST complete response + PR + SD ≥ 6 months). A minor dimensional response (&lt; 20%) was detected in nine patients. A maximum standard uptake value decrease ≥ 25% was observed in 10 (39%) of 26 patients evaluable for PET response at 3 months. Changes in the Brief Pain Inventory score were consistent with the response assessment. Median PFS (intention-to-treat population, 56 patients) was 9 months. No unexpected toxicities were observed.</str>
      <str>This is the largest phase II study in chordoma to date. It confirms anecdotal evidence that imatinib has antitumor activity in this orphan disease, and therefore, it is worth further investigation.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare neoplasms that show a proclivity for the spheno-occiput and sacral regions. A "chondroid" variant involving the spheno-occiput has been associated with improved survival. "Classic" or nonchondroid chordomas are uniformly immunoreactive for keratins. Chondroid chordomas are said to be immunonegative for epithelial markers, a feature used to support the concept that they represent chondrosarcomas.</str>
      <str>The authors performed immunohistochemical studies on 25 patients with chondroid chordoma (mean age, 40.0 years) and on 16 patients with classic chordomas (mean age, 44.2 years) to establish tumor subsets based upon immunophenotype, specifically reactivity for epithelial markers. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were then constructed for each group with age as an added variable.</str>
      <str>All classic chordomas reacted for keratins as did 8 (32%) of the 25 chondroid chordomas. Forty-four percent of classic and 85% of chondroid chordomas were positive for S-100 protein. At 5 years, all patients younger than 40 years of age were alive in both the classic and chondroid groups. In contrast, of patients older than 40 years of age, only 22% with classic chordomas and 38% with chondroid chordomas were alive.</str>
      <str>Regardless of tumor subtype, age is the single most important variable in determining survival; patients younger than 40 years of age do better than older patients. There are no significant survival differences between patients with cartilage-containing tumors that are keratin immunopositive ("true" chondroid chordoma) or negative (chondrosarcoma). Immunostaining for keratins is of no prognostic value in assessing chondroid lesions of the spheno-occiput.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare tumor, and its natural history is still not well known.</str>
      <str>All patients affected by localized chordoma surgically treated at Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, and Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy, between 1980 and 2008 were reviewed. Local recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed both from time of diagnosis and from time of local recurrence/distant metastasis. A multivariable analysis to identify independent prognostic factors was carried out.</str>
      <str>A total of 138 consecutive patients were identified (sacrum 78%, lumbar spine 15%, cervical-dorsal spine 7%). Of these, 130 underwent surgical resection. Median follow-up was 142 months. The 5- and 10-year OS, local relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) were, respectively, 78% and 54%, 52% and 33%, and 86% and 72%. Size was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P value &lt; .001), LRFS (P value: .038), and DRFS (P value: .004), while surgical margins independently predicted LRFS (P value: .003) with a trend for OS. The 5- and 10-year OS, LRFS, and DRFS after the first local relapse were 50% and 26%, 47% and 31%, and 64% and 61%. The size of the recurrence and quality of surgical margins did not influence postrelapse OS. The 5-year OS after the second local relapse was 19%. 22% of patients developed distant metastases with a 5-year post-metastases OS of 33%.</str>
      <str>Tumor size and surgical margins affected outcome only on initial presentation. However, wide surgery was feasible in a minority of cases. Most patients died of local-regional disease even when metastases occurred. Indeed, long-term prognosis was such that disease-free survival at 10 years was only 26%.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiate in vitro into all cell lineages. We previously found that the p38 mitogen activated kinase (p38MAPK) pathway controls the commitment of ES cells toward either cardiomyogenesis (p38 on) or neurogenesis (p38 off ). In this study, we show that p38α knock-out ES cells do not differentiate into cardiac, endothelial, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle lineages. Reexpression of p38MAPK in these cells partially rescues their mesodermal differentiation defects and corrects the high level of spontaneous neurogenesis of knock-out cells. Wild-type ES cells were treated with a p38MAPK-specific inhibitor during the differentiation process. These experiments allowed us to identify 2 early independent successive p38MAPK functions in the formation of mesodermal lineages. Further, the first one correlates with the regulation of the expression of Brachyury, an essential mesodermal-specific transcription factor, by p38MAPK. In conclusion, by genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that p38MAPK activity is essential for the commitment of ES cell into cardiac, endothelial, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle mesodermal lineages.</str>

      <str>The hematopoietic and endothelial lineages derive from mesoderm and are thought to develop through the maturation of a common progenitor, the hemangioblast. To investigate the developmental processes that regulate mesoderm induction and specification to the hemangioblast, we generated an embryonic stem cell line with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) targeted to the mesodermal gene, brachyury. After the in vitro differentiation of these embryonic stem cells to embryoid bodies, developing mesodermal progenitors could be separated from those with neuroectoderm potential based on GFP expression. Co-expression of GFP with the receptor tyrosine kinase Flk1 revealed the emergence of three distinct cell populations, GFP(-)Flk1(-), GFP(+)Flk1(-) and GFP(+)Flk1(+) cells, which represent a developmental progression ranging from pre-mesoderm to prehemangioblast mesoderm to the hemangioblast.</str>

      <str>The heart, brain, and gut develop essential left-right (LR) asymmetries. Specialized groups of ciliated cells have been implicated in LR patterning in mouse, chick, frog, and zebrafish embryos. In zebrafish, these ciliated cells are found in Kupffer's vesicle (KV) and are progeny of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). However, there is no direct evidence in any vertebrate that the genes involved in LR development are specifically required in ciliated cells. By using a novel method in zebrafish, we knocked down the function of no tail (ntl, homologous to mouse brachyury) in DFCs without affecting its expression in other cells in the embryo. We find that the Ntl transcription factor functions cell autonomously in DFCs to regulate KV morphogenesis and LR determination. This is the first evidence that loss-of-gene function exclusively in ciliated cells perturbs vertebrate LR patterning. Our results demonstrate that the ciliated KV, a transient embryonic organ of previously unknown function, is involved in the earliest known step in zebrafish LR development, suggesting that a ciliary-based mechanism establishes the LR axis in all vertebrate embryos.</str>

      <str>Using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with genomic microarrays we have identified targets of No tail (Ntl), a zebrafish Brachyury ortholog that plays a central role in mesoderm formation. We show that Ntl regulates a downstream network of other transcription factors and identify an in vivo Ntl binding site that resembles the consensus T-box binding site (TBS) previously identified by in vitro studies. We show that the notochord-expressed gene floating head (flh) is a direct transcriptional target of Ntl and that a combination of TBSs in the flh upstream region are required for Ntl-directed expression. Using our genome-scale data we have assembled a preliminary gene regulatory network that begins to describe mesoderm formation and patterning in the early zebrafish embryo.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have capacities to self-renew and differentiate into all cell types in vitro. Red ginseng (RG) is known to have a wide range of pharmacological effects in vivo; however, the reports on its effects on hESCs are few. In this paper, we tried to demonstrate the effects of RG on the proliferation and differentiation of hESCs. Undifferentiated hESCs, embryoid bodies (EBs), and hESC-derived cardiac progenitors (CPs) were treated with RG extract at 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/mL. After treatment of undifferentiated hESCs from day 2 to day 6 of culture, BrdU labeling showed that RG treatment increased the proliferation of hESCs, and the expression of Oct4 and Nanog was increased in RG-treated group. To find out the effects of RG on early differentiation stage cells, EBs were treated with RG extract for 10 days and attached for further differentiation. Immunostaining for three germ layer markers showed that RG treatment increased the expressions of Brachyury and HNF3β on EBs. Also, RG treatment increased the expression of Brachyury in early-stage and of Nkx2.5 in late-stage hESC-derived CPs. These results demonstrate facilitating effects of RG extract on the proliferation and early differentiation of hESC.</str>

      <str>The primitive streak is where the mesoderm and definitive endoderm precursor cells ingress from the epiblast during gastrulation. It is often described as an embryological feature common to all amniotes. But such a feature has not been associated with gastrulation in any reptilian species. A parsimonious model would be that the primitive streak evolved independently in the avian and mammalian lineages. Looking beyond the primitive streak, can one find shared features of mesoderm and endoderm formation during amniote gastrulation? Here, we survey the literature on reptilian gastrulation and provide new data on Brachyury RNA and laminin protein expression in gastrula-stage turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) embryos. We propose a model to reconcile the primitive streak-associated gastrulation in birds and the blastopore-associated gastrulation in extant reptiles.</str>

      <str>RNA helicase A (RHA) is the human homologue of the Drosophila maleless protein, an essential factor for the development of male flies. Recently, it was shown that RHA cooperates with the cAMP-responsive element in mediating the cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation of a number of genes. Due to the participation of cAMP as a second messenger in a number of signaling pathways, we examined the function of RHA during mammalian embryogenesis. To examine the role(s) of RHA in mammalian development, RHA knockout mice were generated by homologous recombination. Homozygosity for the mutant RHA allele led to early embryonic lethality. Histological analysis, combined with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL) reactions of RHA-null embryos, revealed marked apoptotic cell death specifically in embryonic ectodermal cells during gastrulation. RNA in situ analyses of the expression of HNF-3beta and Brachyury, two molecular markers for gastrulation, showed that RHA-null embryos at days 7.5 and 8.5 expressed both HNF-3beta and Brachyury in a pattern similar to those of pre- and early streak stages of embryos, respectively. These observations indicate that RHA is necessary for early embryonic development and suggest the requirement of RHA for the survival and differentiation of embryonic ectoderm.</str>

The positivity of S-100 immunoreaction was found to be related to the presence of stromal glycosaminoglycans of the chondroitine sulfate A and C type. NSE. was found positive in cells presenting features of high metabolic activity.

      <str>The Brachyury genes of two divergent ascidians, As-T of Halocynthia roretzi and Ci-Bra of Ciona intestinalis, are expressed exclusively in notochord precursor cells. A previous study showed that the notochord-specific expression of Ci-Bra is controlled by a minimal promoter that is composed of three distinct regions: a region responsible for repression of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, a region for activation of expression in notochord cells, and a region for activation of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, distal to proximal to the transcription initiation site, respectively. We examined various deletion constructs of the As-T/lacZ fusion gene and demonstrate that a module between -289 and -250 bp of the 5'-flanking region is responsible for notochord-specific expression of the reporter gene. Gel-shift assays suggested the binding of nuclear protein(s) to this module. The 5'-flanking region of As-T contains a potential T-binding motif (-ACCTAGGT-) around -160 bp. Deletion of this motif from the p(-289)As-T/lacZ diminished the reporter gene expression. In addition, coinjection of p(-289)As-T/lacZ and synthetic As-T mRNA resulted in ectopic expression of lacZ in non-notochord cells, suggesting that the T-binding motif is responsible for autoactivation of the gene. These findings revealed striking differences between the minimal promoters of As-T and Ci-Bra so far revealed, with respect to their notochord-specific expression. Furthermore, reciprocal injections of reporter gene constructs, namely As-T/lacZ into Ciona eggs and Ci-Bra/lacZ into Halocynthia eggs, suggest alterations in the cis-regulatory elements and trans-activation factors that have occurred during evolution of the two ascidian species.</str>

      <str>The tumour microenvironment is complex and composed of many different constituents, including matricellular proteins such as connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), and is characterized by gradients in oxygen levels. In various cancers, hypoxia and CCN2 promote stem and progenitor cell properties, and regulate the proliferation, migration and phenotype of cancer cells. Our study was aimed at investigating the effects of hypoxia and CCN2 on chordoma cells, using the human U-CH1 cell line. We demonstrate that under basal conditions, U-CH1 cells express multiple CCN family members including CCN1, CCN2, CCN3 and CCN5. Culture of U-CH1 cells in either hypoxia or in the presence of recombinant CCN2 peptide promoted progenitor cell-like characteristics specific to the notochordal tissue of origin. Specifically, hypoxia induced the most robust increase in progenitor-like characteristics in U-CH1 cells, including increased expression of the notochord-associated markers T, CD24, FOXA1, ACAN and CA12, increased cell growth and tumour-sphere formation, and a decrease in the percentage of vacuolated cells present in the heterogeneous population. Interestingly, the effects of recombinant CCN2 peptide on U-CH1 cells were more pronounced under normoxia than hypoxia, promoting increased expression of CCN1, CCN2, CCN3 and CCN5, the notochord-associated markers SOX5, SOX6, T, CD24, and FOXA1 as well as increased tumour-sphere formation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of multiple factors within the tumour microenvironment and how hypoxia and CCN2 may regulate human chordoma cell behaviour. </str>

      <str>Malignant osseous spinal neoplasms are aggressive tumors associated with poor outcomes despite aggressive multidisciplinary measures. While surgical resection has been shown to improve short-term local disease control, it remains debated whether surgical resection is associated with improved overall survival in patients with malignant primary osseous spinal neoplasms. The aim of this manuscript is to review survival data from a US cancer registry spanning 30 years to determine if surgical resection was independently associated with overall survival.</str>
      <str>The SEER registry (1973-2003) was queried to identify cases of histologically confirmed primary spinal chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or Ewing's sarcoma of the mobile spine and pelvis. Patients with systemic metastasis were excluded. Age, gender, race, tumor location, and primary treatments were identified. Extent of local tumor invasion was classified as confined within periosteum versus extension beyond periosteum to surrounding tissues. The association of surgical resection with overall survival was assessed via Cox analysis adjusting for age, radiotherapy, and tumor invasiveness.</str>
      <str>827 patients were identified with non-metastatic primary osseous spinal neoplasms (215 chordoma, 282 chondrosarcoma, 158 osteosarcoma, 172 Ewing's sarcoma). Overall, median survival was histology specific (chordoma, 96 months; Ewing's sarcoma, 90 months; chondrosarcoma, 88 months; osteosarcoma, 18 months). Adjusting for age, radiation therapy, and extent of local tumor invasion in patients with isolated (non-metastatic) spine tumors, surgical resection was independently associated with significantly improved survival for chordoma [hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval; 0.617 (0.25-0.98)], chondrosarcoma [HR (95 %CI); 0.153 (0.07-0.36)], osteosarcoma [HR (95 %CI); 0.382 (0.21-0.69)], and Ewing's sarcoma [HR (95 %CI); 0.494 (0.26-0.96)].</str>

      <str>Chordoma shows various degrees of atypia histologically, however, the relationship between the histological features and the biological behavior still remains controversial. The authors subclassified 17 specimens with chordoma into two groups (ie, trabecular type showing a trabecular patterns and solid type mainly consisting of a diffuse proliferation of tumor cells). The histological grading was performed according to the degree of nuclear atypia on a scale of 1 to 3. Using DNA flow cytometric and immunohistochemical techniques, both the proliferative index (% S + G2 + M phase) and the MIB-1 labeling index (LI) of the tumor cells were estimated regarding their proliferative activities. In addition, p53 overexpression was also investigated using immunohistochemical techniques. There were eight (47.1%) specimens of trabecular type and nine (52.9%) of solid type. In nine specimens of solid type, those with higher nuclear atypia (grade 2 or 3) were significantly more frequent (five specimens, 55.6%) than in trabecular type in which all of the eight specimens were grade 1 (P = 0.44). The proliferative index was significantly higher in grade 2 or 3 lesions than in grade 1 lesions (P = .014), and the MIB-1 LI tended to be higher in solid type than in trabecular (P = .088). p53 overexpression was detected in two specimens of solid type, and the MIB-1 LI in these two specimens was significantly higher (P = .037) than that in the specimens without p53 overexpression.

      <str>To investigate [18F]-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FMISO-PET/CT) detection of targetable hypoxic subvolumes (HSVs) in chordoma of the mobile or sacrococcygeal spine.</str>
      <str>A prospective, pilot study of 20 patients with primary or locally recurrent chordoma of the mobile or sacrococcygeal spine treated with proton or combined proton/photon radiation therapy (RT) with or without surgery was completed. The FMISO-PET/CT was performed before RT and after 19.8-34.2 GyRBE (relative biologic effectiveness). Gross tumor volumes were delineated and HSVs defined including voxels with standardized uptake values ≥1.4 times the muscle mean. Clinical characteristics and treatments received were compared between patients with and without HSVs.</str>
      <str>The FMISO-PET/CT detected HSVs in 12 of 20 patients (60%). Baseline and interval HSV spatial concordance varied (0%-94%). Eight HSVs were sufficiently large (≥5 cm(3)) to potentially allow an intensity modulated proton therapy boost. Patients with HSVs had significantly larger gross tumor volumes (median 410.0 cm(3) vs 63.4 cm(3); P=.02) and were significantly more likely to have stage T2 tumors (5 of 12 vs 0 of 8; P=.04). After a median follow-up of 1.8 years (range, 0.2-4.4 years), a local recurrence has yet to be observed. Three patients developed metastatic disease, 2 with HSVs.</str>
      <str>Detection of targetable HSVs by FMISO-PET/CT within patients undergoing RT with or without surgery for treatment of chordoma of the mobile and sacrococcygeal spine is feasible. The study's inability to attribute interval HSV changes to treatment, rapidly changing hypoxic physiology, or imaging inconsistencies is a limitation. Further study of double-baseline FMISO-PET/CT and hypoxia-directed RT dose escalation, particularly in patients at high risk for local recurrence, is warranted.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this report is to define the role of postoperative radiotherapy in the prevention of local recurrence (LR).</str>
      <str>Sacrococcygeal chordoma is a slow growing, malignant tumor with a clinical poor outcome due to a high LR rate. Several studies emphasize that margin-free tumor resection is the most important predictor of LR. However, even after extralesional resection a high LR up to 80% remains.</str>
      <str>A retrospective series of 15 patients who underwent surgical treatment for sacrococcygeal chordoma in one center between 1981 and 2003 was reviewed. Overall survival and continuous disease-free survival rates were compared between patients with intralesional resection with standard radiotherapy and patients with extralesional resection and no standard radiotherapy.</str>
      <str>The median age at surgery was 53 years. The mean follow-up was 7 years or until death. Mean duration of preoperative complaints was 3 years. In 10 patients, an en bloc resection was (histologic resection margins were free) performed and in 5 patients, an intralesional resection was achieved. All but one patients with intralesional resection received radiotherapy (&gt;50 Gy) and patients with extralesional resection only received radiotherapy in case of LR (6 of 10 patients). After extralesional resection (no initial radiotherapy), all 10 patients had LR of the tumor with a mean time to recurrence of 2 years. Six of these ten patients received radiotherapy after LR and had mean survival duration of 7 years. Only one (of five patients) in the group with intralesional resection and postoperative radiotherapy had LR after 11 years. The time to recurrence was significantly longer and we found a trend toward a longer overall survival in the group that received immediate radiotherapy after surgery.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are an aggressive rare type of malignant bone tumors arising from the remnant of the notochord. Chordomas occur mainly in vertebral bones and account for 1-4% of malignant bone tumors. Management and treatment of chordomas are difficult as they are resistant to conventional chemotherapy; therefore, they are mainly treated with surgery and radiation therapy. In this study, we performed DNA methylation profiling of 26 chordomas and normal nucleus pulposus samples plus UCH-1 chordoma cell line using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite sequencing was used to confirm the methylation data. Gene expression was analyzed using RT-PCR before and after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaDC) treatment of chordoma cell lines. Analysis of the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data led to the identification of 8,819 loci (2.9%) that were significantly differentially methylated (&gt;0.2 average β-value difference) between chordomas and nucleus pulposus samples (adjusted P &lt; 0.05). Among these, 5,868 probes (66.5%) were hypomethylated, compared to 2,951 (33.5%) loci that were hypermethylated in chordomas compared to controls. From the 2,951 differentially hypermethylated probes, 33.3% were localized in the promoter region (982 probes) and, among these, 104 probes showed cancer-specific hypermethylation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicates that the cancer-specific differentially methylated loci are involved in various networks including cancer disease, nervous system development and function, cell death and survival, cellular growth, cellular development, and proliferation. Furthermore, we identified a subset of probes that were differentially methylated between recurrent and non-recurrent chordomas. BeadChip methylation data was confirmed for these genes and gene expression was shown to be upregulated in methylated chordoma cell lines after treatment with 5-azaDC. Understanding epigenetic changes in chordomas may provide insights into chordoma tumorigenesis and development of epigenetic biomarkers. </str>

      <str>Conventional chondrosarcoma (CSA) of the skull base is an uncommon neoplasm that can resemble chordoma, and indeed it is misdiagnosed frequently as such. This has important clinical implications, because when treated with similar aggressive treatment strategies, CSA has a much better prognosis than chordoma. In an effort to identify those morphologic and immunohistochemical features that help to identify conventional skull base CSA correctly and to understand its prognosis better, particularly compared with chordoma, when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, the authors performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 200 CSAs. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 79 years (mean, 39 years), 87 patients were male and 113 patients were female, and most presented with symptoms related to the central nervous system. Approximately 6% of the tumors arose in the sphenoethmoid complex, 28% originated in the clivus, and 66% developed in the temperooccipital junction. Histologically, 15 tumors (7.5%) were classified as hyaline CSA, 59 (29.5%) as myxoid CSA, and 126 (63%) as mixed hyaline and myxoid CSA. A total of 101 (50.5%) tumors were grade 1, 57 (28.5%) had areas of grades 1 and 2, and 42 (21%) were pure grade 2 neoplasms. The vast majority of patients originated from referring hospitals, and the diagnosis was changed prospectively at our institution to CSA from chordoma in 74 patients (37%). Of the tumors studied immunohistochemically, 96 of 97 (98.9%) stained for S-100 protein, 0 of 97 (0%) stained for keratin, and faint staining for epithelial membrane antigen was seen in 7 of 88 tumors (7.95%). All patients underwent high-dose postoperative fractionated precision conformal radiation therapy with a dose that ranged from 64.2 to 79.6 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents (median, 72.1 Cobalt-Gray-equivalents, given in 38 fractions. The 200 patients had a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2.1 mos - 18.5 yrs). Tumor control was defined as lack of progression by clinical and radiographic assessment. Based on this definition, there were three local recurrences, and two of these patients died of tumor-related complications. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 99% and 98% respectively, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were both 99%. In contrast to CSA, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of chordoma have been reported to be approximately 51 % and 35% respectively, and in our institution intensive treatment has resulted in 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 70% and 45% respectively. CSA of the skull base can be distinguished reliably from chordoma, and this distinction is important because skull base CSA has an excellent prognosis when treated with surgery and proton beam irradiation, whereas chordomas have a substantially poorer clinical course despite similar aggressive management.</str>

      <str>Parachordoma is a rare soft-tissue tumor resembling extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and chordoma. Because fewer than 30 cases have been reported and precisely characterized, we studied the clinicopathologic features of seven new cases, comparing the immunohistochemical (six cases) and cytogenetic (one case) profiles with 15 cases of chordoma and six cases of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. Patients with these tumors ranged in age from 7 to 62 years (mean, 35 years) and included four women and three men. The tumors presented as subfascial masses of the thigh (two cases), arm (three cases), chest wall (one cases), and buttocks (one case). In six of seven cases, there was neither recurrence nor metastasis within the follow-up, which ranged from 4 months to 7 years. The tumors were composed of vague nodules of large, rounded eosinophilic cells embedded in a matrix that varied from myxoid to densely hyaline, and the latter areas occasionally resembled primitive cartilage. Transitions between the large eosinophilic cells and smaller rounded and shorter spindled ones were often noted. Multivacuolated (physaliferouslike) cells were noted in all cases but were usually few in number. The matrix stained with Alcian blue (pH 2.5), and this staining was abolished with hyaluronidase predigestion. Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins (CKs) (8/18, 1/10, 7, and 20), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, vimentin CD34, type IV collagen, smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed. All parachordomas strongly expressed CK 8/18, but not the other cytokeratins. Additionally, they expressed EMA (five of six). S-100 protein (six of six), and vimentin (six of six) and had a linear pattern of type IV collagen immunoreactivity around nests of cells (four of five). Calponin was noted in one case, but no cases expressed smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, or glial fibrillary acid protein. In contrast, chordoma expressed CK 8/18 (15 of 15) and CK 1/10 (14 of 15), whereas extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma consistently lacked CK. Although chordoma and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma showed considerable overlap with parachordoma, with respect to EMA and S-100 protein, they infrequently displayed type IV collagen, as was seen in parachordoma. One case of parachordoma studied cytogenetically disclosed trisomy 15, and monosomies of 1, 16, and 17 in contrast to the t(9;22) reported in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and the monosomies of 3, 4, 10, and 13 seen in chordoma. We conclude that the immunohistochemical and cytogenetic profile distinguishes parachordoma from extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and chordoma. Lack of myoepithelial markers, furthermore, suggests parachordoma is not a deeply situated adnexal tumor. Because of these differences, parachordoma is best regarded as a distinct lesion without a clear relationship to other well-characterized tumors.</str>

      <str>Surgical approaches to clivus chordoma are discussed. The approaches described in this article have been used in an attempt to minimize morbidity while maximizing exposure. The transseptal-transsphenoidal approach is appropriate for biopsy or for subtotal removal of small midline lesions of the upper (retrosellar) clivus only. The radical pterygomaxillotomy approach is used for gaining access to chordomas of the upper half of the clivus, with or without lateral extension. Removal of the lateral, posterior, and (if necessary) medial walls of the maxillary sinus is followed by resection of most of the contents of the pterygopalatine fossa. The pterygoid plates are then removed with a drill. The sphenoid sinus and upper clivus are then exposed for tumor removal. For more inferior lesions, we have modified the transoral-transpharyngeal approach by creating an inferiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap, which increases exposure of the clivus, particularly laterally. This flap can be extended laterally for paraclival extension. This approach allows removal of the lateral clivus as far laterally as the hypoglossal canal, with no dissection of tongue, mandible, lip, or cervical soft tissues.</str>

Pain assessment was carried out in terms of onset, characteristics, intensity (numerical rating scale), response to pain medication and associated symptoms. The correlation between patients' biographic data, preoperative neuropathic pain, type and levels of surgery and pain were analyzed. There were 21 patients; 14 male and 7 female patients.

En bloc resection or even fully resecting the tumor along its margin offers improved patient survival and a potential disease cure. Complete resection of tumors involving the upper cervical vertebrae requires a combined anterior-posterior approach but is complicated by the presence of vertebral arteries (VAs). In addition, reconstruction of the postresection defect may be prone to failure. The authors present a case of a chordoma involving the axis that was treated using a single-stage total intralesional C-2 spondylectomy with preservation of both VAs because the patient did not tolerate a preoperative occlusion test.

      <str>Intralesional fibrous septum (IFS), a histologic architecture that is typical of chordoma, consists of proliferating spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like cells with an abundance of collagen fibers. However, the histogenesis of IFS is still controversial. In a series of 122 chordomas, special emphasis was placed on the morphology of host tissues involved in IFS and on a transition between IFS and neighboring tissues. In 23 lesions, IFS was also characterized both histochemically and immunohistochemically. IFS was observed in 79 (64.8%) lesions. Occasionally, IFS contained bone fragments and hyalinized matrix with no lining of osteoblastic cells, suggesting degenerated rather than metaplastic bone tissue. Moreover, IFS occasionally showed a direct transition to host bone trabeculae. Histochemically and immunohistochemically, IFS included calcium deposits positive for Alizarin red S staining and expressed both type I and type III collagen. In extraosseous lesions extending to the adjacent soft tissues, IFS frequently involved muscle fibers or peripheral nerve fibers and displayed a smooth transition to neighboring soft tissues. We believe that IFS is induced by a tumor-host interaction that is based on the host bone trabeculae in intraosseous lesions or on soft tissues in extraosseous lesions.</str>

Eleven chordomas arose from the clivus; the others originated in the sacral region (three patients), thoracic spine (one), cervical spine (three), and lumbar spine (three). Primary treatment consisted of surgery, reserving radiation therapy for recurrence in the majority of patients. Radiation doses, delivered with megavoltage equipment, ranged between 5,000 cGy delivered over 5 weeks and 6,600 cGy over 6 1/2 weeks.

      <str>The authors report on two cases of sacrococcygeal chordoma, with complications involving visceral organ metastases and distal bony metastases. Chordomas are malignant tumors which develop in adult subjects which originate from remnants of the embryonic notochord. Sacrococcygeal localization is found in 50% of the 1,300 cases reported in the medical literature, which represents 20% of sacrococcygeal tumors observed. The difficulty and the delay in diagnosing these tumors should decrease by routine CAT scan examination. Diagnostic certainty is based on histological examination, often suggestive of the diagnosis (physaliphore-like cells), possibly combined with ultrastructure and immunohistological study. The clinical course involves local recurrences, but there is a real risk of metastatic development, notably in the case of sacrococcygeal chordomas, with their incidence estimated at 17.5% of cases. Sometimes developing in later stages of their course, histological findings are similar to those of the initial lesion. Organs which are frequently the sites of metastases are the lung (48% of cases) and bone (26%), then the lymphatic organs, the liver, and subcutaneous tissue... Therapeutic management is unsatisfactory, with ideally, complete surgical excision of the initial tumor of its size permits and hence early diagnosis of this condition is a prerequisite for good results.</str>

The surgical technique used to treat the recurrent form also used a posterior approach, with complete resection of the neoplasm including the scar of the previous operation and the last remaining segment of the coccyx. No intra- or postoperative complications were reported. The authors examine the clinical and histological aspects of this neoplasm, concluding that the correct form of treatment must aim both to protect the adjacent anatomic structures and to achieve radical exeresis, as well as achieving a simpler surgical approach unhampered by complications.

      <str>Chordomas are slow-growing malignant tumors that arise from fetal notochord cells. They are commonly found at the cranial or caudal ends of the spinal cord, but can be seen infrequently in other areas of the cord. Thoracic chordomas can present as either a posterior mediastinal mass or with cord compression symptoms. The tumors present most frequently in the 4th to 5th decade of life. It is extremely rare to see thoracic chordoma in a child. The treatment of choice for chordomas is surgery. The tumors should be totally excised when possible. If the tumor is large or invasive, debulking is indicated. Adjuvant therapy is controversial. Chordomas are very resistant to radiotherapy but there have been several reports of increased survival with high-dose radiotherapy (7,500 rad). Chemotherapy is unproven in the treatment of chordomas. Chordomas tend to recur locally quite frequently and occasionally with distant metastases. Survival ranges from 10% to 30% at 5 years.</str>

      <str>En bloc removal of the lower lumbar vertebral bodies (VBs) is a major surgical challenge. The authors describe the surgical technique used in two patients who presented with chordoma confined to the L-5 and L-4 VB, respectively. These tumors were diagnosed using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging during investigation for back pain. Both patients underwent a combined (two-stage) anterior-posterior approach. In the first case the posterior stage of the procedure was followed by an anterior retroperitoneal approach, and in the second case a lateral retroperitoneal approach was used. Complete en bloc excision of the tumor was achieved in each case, even though in the second case the VB fractured when it was mobilized. The correlation between the MR imaging findings and surgical specimens was remarkable. The authors conclude that en bloc resection is feasible in these cases. Because mobilization of the VB is more difficult in the lateral approach, the authors favor the anterior retroperitoneal approach. The authors anticipate the need for such procedures to increase with the widespread use of MR imaging, which demonstrates the extent of these tumors with remarkable accuracy.</str>

      <str>Sixty patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma, who were seen at this center between 1946 and 1985, were studied with particular attention to the radiographic findings. This study was undertaken because of the large number of these cases and comparison was made between the plain films available in 39 patients and the computed tomography CT studies in 22. Bone destruction was found in 78% on plain films but in 90% on CT. A soft tissue mass was identified in plain films in 60% but in 90% on CT. Calcific debris was found in plain films in 44% but in 87% on CT. Mostly the debris consisted of coarse irregular fragments and probably represented sequestrated necrotic bone. Myelography was performed in only 15 patients. Angiography was studied in 10 cases. Of the 60 patients 88% underwent surgical resection. The tumor recurred in 80% and in only 20% was there no evidence of recurrence. Distant metastases occurred in 24% of patients. Fifty percent survived 5 years; 28% survived 10 years; mean survival 7.5 years.</str>

      <str>Frequency distribution data for primary bone sarcomas have long been used to provide clues to the diagnosis of bone cancers after their identification in radiographs. Age and skeletal site are often helpful, in addition to specific radiographic features, in narrowing down the probable histologic categories of bone neoplasms before biopsy.</str>
      <str>Data on 2627 histologically confirmed primary malignant tumors of bone, as collected by the SEER program during the period 1973-1987, were analyzed by age, sex, race, and anatomical site.</str>
      <str>Osteosarcoma was the most frequently diagnosed primary sarcoma of bone (35.1%), followed by chondrosarcoma (25.8%), Ewing's sarcoma (16.0%), chordoma (8.4%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, including fibrosarcoma (5.6%). The most frequently diagnosed sarcoma of bone in persons younger than age 20 was osteosarcoma, followed by Ewing's sarcoma. Chondrosarcoma was the most frequently diagnosed bone tumor in the population older than age 50. The overall 5-year relative survival rates were as follows: osteosarcoma, 41.0%; chondrosarcoma, 72.7%; Ewing's sarcoma, 41.2%; chordoma, 63.8%; and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, 42.9%.

      <str>A case of chordoma was reported with a special reference to the computed tomography. A 22-year-old female, who had been in good health, was admitted to Kagoshima University Hospital on December 8, 1978 with a chief complaint of diplopia. Physical examination was nothing particular and neurologic examination revealed the left abducent nerve palsy. The labolatory findings including blood count, serum electrolytes, hormonal study, carcinoembrynonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein were within normal limits. Plain skull filsm showed a retro-sellar calcification in combination with a bony erosion of the dorsum sellae and the clivus. The left vertebral arteriography and the left carotid arteriography showed a space taking lesion extended from the retro-clival to the left parasellar region. The axial CT scanning showed a round and irregular high density area consistent with calcification, at the retro-clival area, middle cranial fossa, and parasellar region in the left side, and no enhancement effect was acquired. The coronal CT appearance showed a round but discontinuous high density area like a coral reef, based on the clivus. These CT findings indicated the extension of the space taking legion, clearly. Intra-capsular removal of the tumor was performed and histologic examination confirmed the chordoma. It will be emphasized that CT scan, particularly coronal section was one of the most useful diagnostic procedure of amss of the skull base.</str>

The applied carbon ion dose ranged from 54.0 Gray equivalent (GyE) to 73.6 GyE (median 70.4).</str>
      <str>The mean age at treatment was 55 years for the surgery group and 65 years for the carbon ion RT group. The median duration of follow-up was 76 months for the surgery group and 49 months for the carbon ion RT group. The local recurrence-free survival rate at 5 years was 62.5% for the surgery and 100% for the carbon ion RT group, and the disease-specific survival rate at 5 years was 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. Urinary-anorectal function worsened in 6 patients (60%) in the surgery group, but it was unchanged in all the patients who had undergone carbon ion RT. Postoperative wound complications requiring reoperation occurred in 3 patients (30%) after surgery and in 1 patient (14%) after carbon ion RT. The functional outcome evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system revealed 55% in the surgery group and 75% in the carbon ion RT group.

      <str>This study aims to evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment modalities of 73 patients with benign and malign sacral tumors and infections from a single institution.</str>
      <str>Seventy-three patients (42 males, 31 females; mean age 48.9 years), who were treated between July 1991 and December 2013, with benign, malign tumors, and infections of the sacrum were retrospectively analyzed for a mean follow-up period of 25.4 months, and a review of the literature was conducted. While 36 patients were treated surgically, 37 were treated medically. Fifty-four patients were diagnosed with malign, and 19 with benign or infectious tumors.</str>
      <str>In 54 patients with malign tumors, metastasis was the most common diagnosis in 20 patients followed by chordoma in 11, and multiple myeloma in 10 patients. Common benign lesions were osteomyelitis in four patients, and giant cell tumor and schwannoma in three patients each. Local recurrence was most commonly observed in the chordoma and chondrosarcoma groups with a rate of 50%. Seven patients including five with metastatic disease, one with chondrosarcoma, and one with chordoma died during follow-ups. While urinary and anal incontinence developed in seven patients after sacral resection, deep infection was reported in four, and superficial infection was reported in two patients.</str>
      <str>Because of the high complication rates in malign sacral tumors, we should perform wide resections with partial or total sacrectomy. Chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients should be screened closely due to a possible recurrence risk after sacrectomy while preserving the nerve roots as possible.

      <str>Surgical resection margins are reportedly the most important predictor of survival and local recurrence with sacral chordomas. We examined the relevance of invasion of the surrounding posterior pelvic musculature (piriformis and gluteus maximus) at initial diagnosis to local recurrence after sacrectomy. We retrospectively reviewed 18 patients with histologically verified sacral chordoma seen at our institution between 1998 and 2005. There were 14 men and four women with a mean age of 65.1 years (range, 31-78 years). The average overall followup was 4.4 years (range, 0.5-10 years), 5.4 years for the living patients (range, 3-10 years), and 2.8 years for the deceased (range, 0.5-5.4 years). Local recurrence occurred in 12 patients (66%) 29 months postoperatively (range, 2-84 months). Six of these patients had wide excisions at initial surgery, five had marginal excisions, and one had an intralesional excision. Ten patients had wide surgical margins, six of whom (60%) had local recurrences. Tumor invasion of adjacent muscles at presentation was present in 14 patients, 12 of whom (85%) had local recurrences. Sacroiliac joint involvement was seen in 10 patients, nine of whom (90%) had local recurrences. The findings suggest obtaining wide surgical margins posteriorly, by excising parts of the piriformis, gluteus maximus, and sacroiliac joints, may result in better local disease control in patients with sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>T-box genes encode transcriptional regulators that control many aspects of embryonic development. Here, we demonstrate that the mesodermally expressed zebrafish spadetail (spt)/VegT and no tail (ntl)/Brachyury T-box genes are semi-redundantly and cell-autonomously required for formation of all trunk and tail mesoderm. Despite the lack of posterior mesoderm in spt(-);ntl(-) embryos, dorsal-ventral neural tube patterning is relatively normal, with the notable exception that posterior medial floor plate is completely absent. This contrasts sharply with observations in single mutants, as mutations singly in ntl or spt enhance posterior medial floor plate development. We find that ntl function is required to repress medial floor plate and promote notochord fate in cells of the wild-type notochord domain and that spt and ntl together are required non cell-autonomously for medial floor plate formation, suggesting that an inducing signal present in wild-type mesoderm is lacking in spt(-);ntl(-) embryos.</str>

      <str>Oct-1, a member of the POU family of transcription factors, is expressed at relatively high levels in ectodermal and mesodermal cell lineages during early Xenopus embryogenesis (Veenstra et al, 1995). Here we show that overexpression of Oct-1 induces programmed cell death concomitant with the loss of the posterior part of the body axis. Truncated Oct-1 variants, missing either the C-terminal or N-terminal trans-activation domain, exhibit a different capacity to cause such developmental defects. Oct-1-induced cell death is rescued in unilaterally injected embryos by non-injected cells, indicative of the non-cell autonomous character of the developmental effects of Oct-1. This was confirmed by marker gene analysis, which showed a significant decrease in brachyury expression, suggesting that Oct-1 interferes with an FGF-type signalling pathway.</str>

      <str>Germ cells ensure reproduction and heredity. In mice, primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors for spermatozoa and oocytes, are induced in pluripotent epiblast by BMP4 and WNT3, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, using an in vitro PGC specification system, we show that WNT3 induces many transcription factors associated with mesoderm in epiblast-like cells through β-CATENIN. Among these, T (BRACHYURY), a classical and conserved mesodermal factor, was essential for robust activation of Blimp1 and Prdm14, two of the germline determinants. T, but not SMAD1 or TCF1, binds distinct regulatory elements of both Blimp1 and Prdm14 and directly upregulates these genes, delineating the downstream PGC program. Without BMP4, a program induced by WNT3 prevents T from activating Blimp1 and Prdm14, demonstrating a permissive role of BMP4 in PGC specification. These findings establish the key signaling mechanism for, and a fundamental role of a mesodermal factor in, mammalian PGC specification.</str>

      <str>The modulation of developmental biochemical pathways by mechanical cues is an emerging feature of animal development, but its evolutionary origins have not been explored. Here we show that a common mechanosensitive pathway involving β-catenin specifies early mesodermal identity at gastrulation in zebrafish and Drosophila. Mechanical strains developed by zebrafish epiboly and Drosophila mesoderm invagination trigger the phosphorylation of β-catenin-tyrosine-667. This leads to the release of β-catenin into the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it triggers and maintains, respectively, the expression of zebrafish brachyury orthologue notail and of Drosophila Twist, both crucial transcription factors for early mesoderm identity. The role of the β-catenin mechanosensitive pathway in mesoderm identity has been conserved over the large evolutionary distance separating zebrafish and Drosophila. This suggests mesoderm mechanical induction dating back to at least the last bilaterian common ancestor more than 570 million years ago, the period during which mesoderm is thought to have emerged. </str>

      <str>The transcription factor brachyury (T, BRA) is one of the first markers of gastrulation and lineage specification in vertebrates. Despite its wide use and importance in stem cell and developmental biology, its functional genomic targets in human cells are largely unknown. Here, we use differentiating human embryonic stem cells to study the role of BRA in activin A-induced endoderm and BMP4-induced mesoderm progenitors. We show that BRA has distinct genome-wide binding landscapes in these two cell populations, and that BRA interacts and collaborates with SMAD1 or SMAD2/3 signalling to regulate the expression of its target genes in a cell-specific manner. Importantly, by manipulating the levels of BRA in cells exposed to different signalling environments, we demonstrate that BRA is essential for mesoderm but not for endoderm formation. Together, our data illuminate the function of BRA in the context of human embryonic development and show that the regulatory role of BRA is context dependent. Our study reinforces the importance of analysing the functions of a transcription factor in different cellular and signalling environments. </str>

      <str>We previously described a locus on chromosome (Chr) 17 of the mouse that is critical for normal testis development. This locus was designated "T-associated sex reversal" (Tas) because it segregated with the dominant brachyury allele hairpin tail (Thp) and caused gonads of C57BL/6J XY, Thp/+ individuals to develop as ovaries or ovotestes rather than as testes. To clarify the inheritance of Tas, we investigated the effects of T-Orleans (TOrl), another brachyury mutation, on gonad development. We found that gonads of C57BL/6J XY, Thp/+ and TOrl/+ mice develop ovarian tissue if the Y chromosome is derived from the AKR/J inbred strain, whereas normal testicular development occurs in the presence of a Y chromosome derived from the C57BL/6J inbred strain. From these observations we conclude that: (1) Tas is located in a region on Chr 17 common to the deletions associated with Thp, and TOrl, and (2) the Y-linked testis determining gene, Tdy, carried by the AKR/J inbred strain differs from that of the C57BL/6J inbred strain. We suggest that in mammals Tdy is not the sole testis determinant because autosomal loci must be genetically compatible with Tdy for normal testicular development.</str>

The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying ESC pluripotency are, however, poorly understood. We characterize a population of early mesoderm-specified (EM) progenitors that is generated from mouse ESCs by bone morphogenetic protein stimulation. We further show that pluripotent ESCs are actively regenerated from EM progenitors by the action of the divergent homeodomain-containing protein Nanog, which, in turn, is upregulated in EM progenitors by the combined action of leukemia inhibitory factor and the early mesoderm transcription factor T/Brachyury. These findings uncover specific roles of leukemia inhibitory factor, Nanog, and bone morphogenetic protein in the self-renewal of ESCs and provide novel insights into the cellular bases of ESC pluripotency.</str>

By activating or blocking the pathway we found that Notch expands the floor plate domain of sonic hedgehog and pintallavis and represses the notochordal markers chordin and brachyury, with a concomitant reduction of the notochord size. We propose that within a population of the early organiser with equivalent potential to develop either as notochord or floor plate, Notch activation favours floor plate development at the expense of the notochord, preferentially before mid gastrula. We present evidence that sonic hedgehog down-regulates chordin, suggesting that secreted Sonic hedgehog may be involved or reinforcing the cell-fate switch executed by Notch.

      <str>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for patterning many structures in vertebrates including the nervous system, chordamesoderm, limb and endodermal organs. In the sea urchin, a basal deuterostome, Hh signaling is shown to participate in organizing the mesoderm. At gastrulation the Hh ligand is expressed by the endoderm downstream of the Brachyury and FoxA transcription factors in the endomesoderm gene regulatory network. The co-receptors Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo) are expressed by the neighboring skeletogenic and non-skeletogenic mesoderm. Perturbations of Hh, Ptc and Smo cause embryos to develop with skeletal defects and inappropriate non-skeletogenic mesoderm patterning, although initial specification of mesoderm occurs without detectable abnormalities. Perturbations of the pathway caused late defects in skeletogenesis and in the non-skeletogenic mesoderm, including altered numbers of pigment and blastocoelar cells, randomized left-right asymmetry of coelomic pouches, and disorganized circumesophageal muscle causing an inability to swallow. Together the data support the requirement of Hh signaling in patterning each of the mesoderm subtypes in the sea urchin embryo.</str>

      <str>Developmental genetics has shown that the Brachyury (T) gene has a key role in mesoderm formation during gastrulation in the mouse. Homozygous embryos have a defective allantois, degenerate or absent notochord and disrupted primitive streak and node. The neural tube is kinked and somite formation interrupted. The T gene has been cloned and is expressed during the early stages of gastrulation, being restricted to the primitive streak region, nascent mesoderm and notochord. Neither the sequence of the gene nor its expression pattern define its developmental function. To study the cell autonomy of the T mutation we have isolated and genetically characterized embryonic stem cell lines and studied their behaviour in chimaeras. T/+ embryonic stem cells form normal chimaeras, whereas T/T in equilibrium with +/+ chimaeras mimic the T/T mutant phenotype. The results indicate that the T gene acts cell autonomously in the primitive streak and notochord but may activate a signalling pathway involved in the specification of other mesodermal tissues.</str>

Binding site selection experiments show that the three proteins bind the same core sequence, but they select paired sites that differ in their orientation and spacing. Lysine 149 of Xbra is conserved in all Brachyury homologues, while the corresponding amino acid in VegT and Eomesodermin is asparagine.

In contrast with X. laevis embryos, the blastopore closes before elongation of the archenteron and notochord in the embryos of G. riobambae and of the dendrobatid frogs. Moreover, the circumblastoporal collar (CBC) thickens due to the accumulation of involuted cells. An embryonic disk, however, is formed only in the G. riobambae gastrula. We differentiate three gastrulation patterns according to the speed of development: In X. laevis, elongation of the archenteron and notochord begin in the early to mid gastrula, whereas in the dendrobatids C. machalilla and E. anthonyi the archenteron elongates at mid gastrula and the notochord elongates after gastrulation. In G. riobambae, only involution takes place during gastrulation. Archenteron and notochord elongation occur in the post gastrula. In the non-aquatic reproducing frogs, the margin of the archenteron expands anisotropically, resulting in an apparent displacement of the CBC from a medial to a posterior location, resembling the displacement of Hensen's node in the chick and mouse.

Four patients were clinically disease-free at a mean follow-up of 94.5 months, while five patients died as a result of progressive local or metastatic disease at a mean follow-up of 31.4 months. Only one patient had normal bowel and bladder control postoperatively, and only three were able to walk without assistive devices. Eight patients had wound complications, and one patient had a deep-vein thrombosis. With the numbers available, neither negative margins at the time of initial tumor resection nor adjuvant radiation therapy had a significant impact on survival or local recurrence. More cephalad levels of resection were associated with significantly worse bowel (p = 0.01) and bladder (p = 0.01) control. Complications were frequent and were more common with a larger tumor size at the time of presentation (p = 0.034).</str>
      <str>The treatment of sacral chordoma is an arduous clinical undertaking that requires a multidisciplinary approach and attention to detail from the outset. Despite aggressive well-planned surgical management and adherence to strict surveillance protocols, frequent recurrence and the late onset of metastatic disease are to be expected in a substantial proportion of patients, especially those with a very large chordoma or one at a more cephalad level. Adequate surgical treatment results in substantial functional impairment and numerous complications; however, it does offer the possibility of long-term disease-free survival. We advocate an attempt at complete resection, when there is still a possibility of cure, and aggressive treatment of local recurrences.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is aggressive, locally invasive, and has a poor prognosis. Chordomas are thought to arise from transformed remnants of notochord and have a predilection for the axial skeleton, with the most common sites being the sacrum, skull base, and spine. The gold standard treatment for chordomas of the mobile spine and sacrum is en-bloc excision with wide margins and postoperative external-beam radiation therapy. Treatment of clival chordomas is unique from other locations with an enhanced emphasis on preservation of neurological function, typified by a general paradigm of maximally safe cytoreductive surgery and advanced radiation delivery techniques. In this Review, we highlight current standards in diagnosis, clinical management, and molecular characterisation of chordomas, and discuss current research.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare neoplasms arising from notochord remnants. Tyrosine kinase receptors (RTK) are altered in these lesions. We used a tissue microarray containing 58 chordomas to examine the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α and PDGFR-β, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Met, c-Kit, pAKT, mammalian target of rapamycin, and HER2 by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Most tumors were positive for PDGFR-α (92%), PDGFR-β (85%), c-Kit (77.4%), c-Met (96%), pAKT (82%), mammalian target of rapamycin (56%), HER2 (24%), and EGFR (26%) by immunohistochemistry. Amplifications or deletions could not be identified for HER2 or EGFR in the 13 cases available for fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis; however, chromosome 7 polysomy was detected in 29% of the cases. The only factor directly associated with a poorer survival rate was pAKT positivity (P = .042). The 5-year survival rate for patients with pAKT-negative chordomas was 100%, whereas it was 45% for patients with pAKT-positive chordomas. Our results confirm that RTKs are frequently altered in chordomas. Given the implications of pAKT positivity, RTK inhibitors might be efficacious, and drugs that inhibit AKT, alone or in combination with radiotherapy, could be an effective treatment for patients with refractory chordomas. </str>

      <str>The difference in biological features between recurrent and nonrecurrent intracranial chordomas has not been studied. In this study, proliferative potentials of chordomas were studied with an immunohistochemical staining method, mainly using anti-Ki-67 antibody, MIB-1, which is known to be available for archival paraffin sections, together with immunohistochemical studies on the expression of cell cycle or apoptosis-related proteins, including p53, cyclin D1, and bcl-2 proteins. The correlation among MIB-1 staining indices, the immunoreactivities of these proteins, and clinical courses of intracranial chordomas were analyzed retrospectively, and the statistically significant correlation between MIB-1 staining index (SI) and recurrence has been clarified. The mean MIB-1 SI of recurrent tumors was 10.2%, being shown to be higher than that of nonrecurrent tumors (2.8%). The immunohistochemically positive staining of cell cycle-related protein, especially p53 and cyclin D1 proteins, correlated well with recurrence and high MIB-1 SI. In conclusion, both the examination of proliferative potentials of chordomas using MIB-1 SI and the study of the immunoreactivity of p53 and cyclin D1 proteins are important for their biological and histopathological analyses and the prediction of future recurrence.</str>

      <str>To analyze a series of patients with pathologically confirmed skull-base chordoma, and to develop an algorithm for the management of this challenging disease based on the data, our experience, and the current literature.</str>
      <str>Between the years 1986 and 2001, 26 chordoma patients received multimodality treatment with various combinations of conventional surgery, skull-base surgical techniques, and gamma-knife surgery at the Marmara University Faculty of Medicine. A total of 57 procedures (43 tumor excision surgeries, 7 gamma-knife procedures, and 7 other operations to treat complications) were performed. The mean follow-up period was 4 years (48.5 months). Karnofsky scoring was used to follow the patients' clinical conditions, and magnetic resonance image analysis was used to measure tumor volume over time.</str>
      <str>Seven patients died during follow-up. Two of the deaths were due to surgical complications, four resulted from clinical deterioration related to tumor recurrence, and one was unrelated to neoplasia. The rate of tumor recurrence after the first surgical treatment was 58%. Residual tumor volume was lower in the cases in whom skull-base approaches were used as first-line management. The 19 survivors showed little change in clinical status from initial diagnosis to the most recent follow-up check. The mean follow-up time after gamma-knife treatment was 23.3 months. During this period, mean tumor volume increased 28% above the mean volume at the time of gamma-knife surgery. The mean Karnofsky score decreased by 6% during the same time frame.</str>
      <str>The most effective first-line treatment for chordoma patients is surgery. The findings for residual tumor volume indicated that skull-base approaches are the best surgical option, and the complication rates for these techniques are acceptable. However, it is rare that surgery ever biologically eradicates this disease, and the data showed that these chordomas almost always progress if the tumor volume at the time of diagnosis exceeds 20 cm(3). Based on our experience and the biological character of the disease, we now advocate radiosurgical treatment (gamma-knife in our case) immediately after the first-line skull-base surgery when the tumor residual volume is &lt;30 cm(3).</str>

      <str>Six participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 71 patients who underwent SRS for chordoma. The median patient age was 45 years (range, 7-80 years).

      <str>At a median follow-up of 5 years (range, 0.6-14 years) after SRS, 23 patients died of tumor progression. The 5-year actuarial overall survival after SRS was 80% for the entire group, 93% for the no prior fractionated radiation therapy (RT) group (n = 50), and 43% for the prior RT group (n = 21). Younger age, longer interval between initial diagnosis and SRS, no prior RT, &lt; 2 cranial nerve deficits, and smaller total tumor volume were significantly associated with longer patient survival. The 5-year treated tumor control rate after SRS was 66% for the entire group, 69% for the no prior RT group, and 62% for the prior RT group. Older age, recurrent group, prior RT, and larger tumor volume were significantly associated with worse tumor control.</str>

      <str>Between 2009 and 2012, 56 patients with sacral chordoma were treated in our center. The tumor was located above S3 in 33 patients and in S3 or below in 23 patients. In all, 41 patients received radiation therapy for the primary tumor, while 15 patients were treated for the recurrent tumor. Toxicity was measured using NCI CTCAE v.4.03. Local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method.</str>
      <str>A total of 23 patients were irradiated with carbon ions in combination with photon IMRT, while 33 received carbon ion therapy only. Forty-three patients had a macroscopic tumor at treatment start with a median tumor size (GTV) of 244 ml (range 5-1188 ml). The median total dose was 66 Gy (range 60-74 Gy; RBE). After a median follow-up time of 25 months, the 2- and 3-year local control probability was 76 % and 53 %, respectively. The overall survival rate was 100 %. Treatment for primary tumor and male patients resulted in significant better local control. No higher toxicity occurred within the follow-up time.</str>
      <str>High-dose photon/carbon ion beam radiation therapy is safe and, especially for primary sacral chordomas, highly effective.

      <str>Chordomas and chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors that are reported to have similar clinical presentations and radiological features but different behaviors and outcomes. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether specific radiological features of skull-base chordomas or chondrosarcomas are correlated with histopathology, and thus allow preoperative diagnosis. The study involved 32 classic chordomas, 6 chondroid chordomas and 4 chondrosarcomas (42 tumors total). For each case, tumor size and extent, the detailed anatomy involved, and magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography findings were analyzed. Tumor extent was assessed using a novel method that assessed presence/absence in 18 defined skull-base zones. The chondrosarcomas presented significantly earlier in life than the chordomas (means, 20.5 years versus 36 years, respectively). At time of diagnosis, the median tumor volume was 23 cm(3) (range, 1.2-78.8 cm(3)) and the mean tumor extent was 6.7+/-2.9 zones. There were no differences between chordomas and chondrosarcomas, or between the two chordoma subgroups, with respect to lesion volume or extent. Comparison of other imaging findings revealed no features that were diagnostic for either chordoma or chondrosarcoma. The data support previous claims that chondrosarcomas present earlier in life than chordomas, but this finding is not diagnostic. There is wide variation in the extent of skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, and in the specific anatomical structures these tumors involve. None of the MRI or CT features of these tumors appear to be useful for differentiating chordomas from chondrosarcomas preoperatively. For surgical planning, specific, area-oriented definition of tumor extent might provide more useful information than tumor-type classification schemes.</str>

      <str>Dynamic spatiotemporal expression of the nodal gene and its orthologs is involved in the dose-dependent induction and patterning of mesendoderm during early vertebrate embryogenesis. We report loss-of-function studies that define a high degree of synergistic negative regulation on the Xenopus nodal-related genes (Xnrs) by extracellular Xenopus antivin/lefty (Xatv/Xlefty)-mediated functional antagonism and Brachyury-mediated transcriptional suppression. A strong knockdown of Xlefty/Xatv function was achieved by mixing translation- and splicing-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides that target both the A and B alloalleles of Xatv. Secreted and cell-autonomous inhibitors of Xnr signaling were used to provide evidence that Xnr-mediated induction was inherently long-range in this situation in the large amphibian embryo, essentially being capable of spreading over the entire animal hemisphere. There was a greater expansion of the Organizer and mesendoderm tissues associated with dorsal specification than noted in previous Xatv knockdown experiments in Xenopus, with consequent exogastrulation and long-term maintenance of expanded axial tissues. Xatv deficiency caused a modest animal-ward expansion of the marginal zone expression territory of the Xnr1 and Xnr2 genes. In contrast, introducing inhibitory Xbra-En(R) fusion constructs into Xatv-deficient embryos caused a much larger increase in the level and spatial extent of Xnr expression. However, in both cases (Xatv/Xlefty-deficiency alone, or combined with Xbra interference), Xnr2 expression was constrained to the superficial cell layer, suggesting a fundamental tissue-specific competence in the ability to express Xnrs, an observation with direct implications regarding the induction of endodermal vs. mesodermal fates. Our experiments reveal a two-level suppressive mechanism for restricting the level, range, and duration of Xnr signaling via extracellular inhibition by Xatv/Xlefty coupled with potent indirect transcriptional repression by Xbra.</str>

      <str>The tadpole larva of an ascidian develops 40 notochord cells in the center of its tail. Most of the notochord cells originate from the A-line precursors, among which inductive interactions are required for the subsequent differentiation of notochord. The presumptive-endoderm blastomeres or presumptive-notochord blastomeres themselves are inducers of notochord formation. Notochord induction takes place during the 32-cell stage. In amphibia, mesoderm induction is thought to be mediated by several growth factors, for example, activins and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). In the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, treatment with bFGF of presumptive-notochord blastomeres that had been isolated at the early 32-cell stage promoted the formation of notochord at a low concentration of bFGF (0.02 ng/ml), while activin failed to induce notochord differentiation. The effect of bFGF reached a maximum at the end of the 32-cell stage and rapidly faded at the beginning of the subsequent cleavage, the time for full induction of notochord being at least 20 minutes. The expression of As-T, a previously isolated ascidian homolog of the mouse Brachyury (T) gene, starts at the 64-cell stage and is detectable exclusively in the presumptive-notochord blastomeres. The present study showed that presumptive-notochord blastomeres, isolated at the early 32-cell stage, neither differentiated into notochord nor expressed the As-T gene. However, when the presumptive-notochord blastomeres were coisolated or recombined with inducer blastomeres, transcripts of As-T were detected. When presumptive-notochord blastomeres were treated with bFGF, the expression of the As-T gene was also detected. These results suggest that inductive interaction is required for the expression of the As-T gene and that the expression of the As-T gene is closely correlated with the determined state of the notochord-precursor cells.</str>

      <str>A cDNA clone for a starfish T-box gene (Ap-Tbr) was isolated and characterized. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the Ap-Tbr gene was a member of the T-brain subfamily, which includes mouse T-brain-1 and Xenopus Eomesodermin. Ap-Tbr was expressed as early as in late blastulae, and the transcript was evident in a disc-like region at the vegetal end or the vegetal plate. In early gastrulae, the gene was expressed in the cells of the invaginated archenteron, from which the majority of mesodermal cells as well as some endodermal cells are derived. The Ap-Tbr expression disappeared by the end of gastrulation, and was not detected in early bipinnaria larvae. This expression pattern of Ap-Tbr suggests its role in an early step of archenteron invagination, associated with mesoderm and endoderm formation. Furthermore, double staining of late blastulae and early gastrulae with a probe specific for Ap-Tbr and one for ApBra (the starfish Brachyury gene) demonstrated that the regions of Ap-Tbr and ApBra expression at the vegetal/posterior end of the embryo did not overlap, the region with Ap-Tbr expression being encircled by a ring-shaped region of ApBra expression. A gap without expression of the two genes was located between them, and the gap was seen around the blastoporal lip in the early gastrula. These observations suggest implication of the two T-box genes, with different roles, in starfish gastrulation.</str>

      <str>A detailed morphological staging system for cattle embryos at stages following blastocyst hatching and preceding gastrulation is presented here together with spatiotemporal mapping of gene expression for BMP4, BRACHYURY, CERBERUS1 (CER1), CRIPTO, EOMESODERMIN, FURIN and NODAL. Five stages are defined based on distinct developmental events. The first of these is the differentiation of the visceral hypoblast underlying the epiblast, from the parietal hypoblast underlying the mural trophoblast. The second concerns the formation of an asymmetrically positioned, morphologically recognisable region within the visceral hypoblast that is marked by the presence of CER1 and absence of BMP4 expression. We have termed this the anterior visceral hypoblast or AVH. Intra-epiblast cavity formation and the disappearance of the polar trophoblast overlying the epiblast (Rauber's layer) have been mapped in relation to AVH formation. The third chronological event involves the transition of the epiblast into the embryonic ectoderm with concomitant onset of posterior NODAL, EOMES and BRACHYURY expression. Lastly, gastrulation commences as the posterior medial embryonic ectoderm layer thickens to form the primitive streak and cells ingress between the embryonic ectoderm and hypoblast. At this stage a novel domain of CER1 expression is seen whereas the AVH disappears. Comparison with the mouse reveals that while gene expression patterns at the onset of gastrulation are well conserved, asymmetry establishment, which relies on extraembryonic tissues such as the hypoblast and trophoblast, has diverged in terms of both gene expression and morphology. </str>

      <str>A retrospective review of 16 consecutive patients treated from 2005 to 2012 was performed. All patients had received at least 1 prior course of radiation therapy to the same area, and all but 1 patient had at least 1 surgical resection for disease before receiving reirradiation. At the time of recurrence or progression, half of the patients underwent additional salvage surgery before receiving reirradiation. The median prior dose of radiation was 75.2 Gy (range, 40-79.2 Gy). Six patients had received prior proton therapy, and the remainder had received photon radiation. The median gross tumor volume at the time of reirradiation was 71 cm(3) (range, 0-701 cm(3)). Reirradiation occurred at a median interval of 37 months after prior radiation (range, 12-129 months), and the median dose of reirradiation was 75.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) (range. 71.2-79.2 Gy [RBE]), given in standard daily fractionation (n=14) or hyperfractionation (n=2).</str>
      <str>The median follow-up time was 23 months (range, 6-63 months); it was 26 months in patients alive at the last follow-up visit (range, 12-63 months). The 2-year estimate for local control was 85%, overall survival 80%, chordoma-specific survival 88%, and development of distant metastases 20%. Four patients have had local progression: 3 in-field and 1 marginal. Late toxicity included grade 3 bitemporal lobe radionecrosis in 1 patient that improved with hyperbaric oxygen, a grade 4 cerebrospinal fluid leak with meningitis in 1 patient, and a grade 4 ischemic brainstem stroke (out of radiation field) in 1 patient, with subsequent neurologic recovery.</str>

C17.2 neural precursor cells were noted to express genes of neurotrophins and neuroprotective factors and to be enable to enhance proliferation, neuritogenesis, and differentiation of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS neuroblasts, suggesting their neurotrophic potential. We used C17.2 cells as neurotrophic chaperones to induce ESCs, D3, and E14TG2a into neural lineage cells. Significantly greater numbers of Sox-2(+), Musashi-1(+), and nestin(+) neurospheres developed in noncontact cocultures than in cultures of ESCs without C17.2 support or with 50% conditioned medium after 8 days. Immunoreactivity of the neuronal, astrocytic and oligodendrocytic markers was evident in cultures further differentiated for 10 days. Expression of Pax-6, Otx-1, and Nurr-1 genes suggested neuroectodermal precursors in products encompassing neural stem cells, dopaminergic neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Alpha-fetoprotein, GATA-4, Brachyury, Nkx-2.5, and Myf-5 genes were not detected, indicating any mesodermal and endodermal cells. However, weak expression of Oct-4 was noted. Behavioral assessment of ischemic mice 2 weeks after transplantation revealed significant improvement in cognitive function compared with that in ischemic sham-operated mice.

      <str>Dietary deprivation and gene disruption studies clearly demonstrate that biologically active retinoids, such as retinoic acid (RA), are essential for numerous developmental programs. Similar ontogenic processes are also affected by retinoic acid excess, suggesting that the effects of retinoid administration reflect normal retinoid-dependent events. In the mouse, exogenous retinoic acid can induce both anterior (anencephaly, exencephaly) and posterior (spina bifida) neural tube defects depending on the developmental stage of treatment. Retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) mediates these effects on the caudal neural tube at 8.5 days postcoitum, as RARgamma-/- mice are completely resistant to spina bifida induced by retinoic acid at this stage. We therefore used this null mouse as a model to examine the molecular nature of retinoid-induced caudal neural tube defects by using a panel of informative markers and comparing their expression between retinoic acid-treated wild-type and RARgamma-/- embryos. Our findings indicate that treatment of wild-type embryos led to a rapid and significant decrease in the caudal expression of all mesodermal markers examined (e.g., brachyury, wnt-3a, cdx-4), whereas somite, neuroepithelial, notochord, floorplate, and hindgut markers were unaffected. RARgamma-/- mutants exhibited normal expression patterns for all markers examined, consistent with the notion that mesodermal defects underlie the etiology of retinoid-induced spina bifida. We also found that posterior somitic, but not caudal presomitic, embryonic tissues contained detectable bioactive retinoids, an observation which correlated with the ability of caudal explants to rapidly clear exogenous RA. Interestingly, transcripts encoding mP450RAI, a cytochrome P450, the product of which is believed to catabolize retinoic acid, were abundant in the retinoid-poor region of the caudal embryo. mP450RAI was rapidly induced by retinoic acid treatment in vivo, consistent with previous studies suggesting that it plays a critical role in retinoid signaling. These data suggest that nascent mesoderm is highly sensitive to retinoic acid and that mP450RAI serves to tightly regulate retinoid levels in the caudal embryo. These findings also raise the possibility that RA may play a role in the generation of posterior mesoderm derivatives in part by affecting brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>The first haematopoietic stem cells in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates are derived from mesoderm, therefore genes that are important in mesoderm patterning and formation might also play an essential role in haematopoietic stem cell commitment and differentiation. Several members of the Wnt gene family are expressed in very specific patterns in embryonic mesoderm and have previously been shown to act as haematopoietic growth factors. In order to investigate in detail the role that such secreted proteins play in the biology of early haematopoietic commitment we have used in vitro differentiation of murine embryonal stem (ES) as a model system. Using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis we identified several candidate Wnt genes whose expression pattern was consistent with a role in generation, maintenance and/or differentiation of early haematopoietic progenitor cells including three genes previously shown to have a role in haematopoiesis (Wnt5a, Wnt2b and Wnt10b). The most interesting candidate was Wnt3, because of its strong and regulated expression during in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells as well as its early embryonic expression in mesoderm. Overexpression of Wnt3 was sufficient to cause a consistent increase in the number of embryoid bodies committing to haematopoiesis further strengthening the evidence that this protein can enhance haematopoietic commitment during in vitro differentiation of ES cells. In addition, overexpression of Wnt3 caused a marked upregulation of Brachyury expression, thus providing some evidence that Brachyury may be one of the target genes for the Wnt3 signalling pathway.</str>

      <str>Thirty-six patients underwent initial operation for sacral chordoma between 1992 and 2007. Data regarding age, gender, tumor size, tumor location, and type of surgery, surgical margins, surrounding muscle invasion, radiation therapy, and recurrences were reviewed and analyzed statistically.</str>
      <str>The average duration of follow-up was 74.4 months (range, 16-182 months). Sixteen patients developed local recurrences at the time of final follow-up. The average recurrence time was 30 months (range, 3-84 months). The 5-year and 10-year actuarial CDFS were 59.5 and 42%, respectively. CDFS was found statistically longer in patients whose tumor highest level at or below S3 compared with above S3 (P=0.047). Patients who had invasion into the surrounding muscle had a shorter CDFS than those without surrounding muscle invasion (P=0.014). Statistic analysis showed that the type of surgery was the most valuable indicator of CDFS (P=0.001). The local recurrence rate was statistically higher when an inadequate margin has been achieved (P=0.021). The Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that surrounding muscle invasion (P=0.024) was an independent adverse prognostic factor for CDFS, whereas incomplete excision (P=0.056) achieved borderline significance.</str>

      <str>Endoscopic resection of nasal and paranasal sinus tumors is more aesthetic and less invasive than conventional resection, such as Luc's operation and lateral rhinotomy. We clarified the effect of radical endoscopic tumor excision and the control of local bleeding hazardous in endoscopic surgery. Subjects were patients with benign lesions in the nasal cavity, medial wall of the maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, and/or sphenoid sinus without concurrent malignant lesions. Although patients selection for malignant tumor excision was based on (1) possible en bloc resection, (2) low-grade malignant tumors, and (3) tumors in the nasal cavity and adjoining paranasal sinus, the final decision was made individual. Subjects were 23 patients with benign tumor (10 inverted papilloma, 9 hemangioma, 2 juvenile angiofibroma, and 2 other tumors) and 4 with malignant tumor (olfactory neuroblastoma, acinic cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and chondroid chordoma) in the nasal and paranasal sinus. The tumor was resected en bloc except for patients with inverted papilloma (2 cases) and chondroid chordoma. Recurrence in benign tumors was zero during a mean observation of 21 months. One with chondroid chordoma, however, suffered a recurrent lesion 7 months after the initial operation. The lesion was successfully salvaged by a similar endoscopic procedure and subsequently treated with electron beam irradiation. Preoperative arterial embolization, laser coagulation, and ligation of the sphenopalatine artery were very useful in reducing blood loss during surgery and maintaining a clear endoscopic view. In intraoperative bleeding volume, less than 100 ml of bleeding occurred during surgery in 23 of 27 patients. The endoscopic excision of benign lesions in the nasal and paranasal sinus is thus as effective as conventional radical surgery. Endoscopic removal of malignant lesions remains controversial because of the small number of patients and short postoperative observation.</str>

      <str>Bcor (BCL6 corepressor) is a widely expressed gene that is mutated in patients with X-linked Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome. BCOR regulates gene expression in association with a complex of proteins capable of epigenetic modification of chromatin. These include Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase components and a Jumonji C (Jmjc) domain containing histone demethylase. To model OFCD in mice and dissect the role of Bcor in development we have characterized two loss of function Bcor alleles. We find that Bcor loss of function results in a strong parent-of-origin effect, most likely indicating a requirement for Bcor in extraembryonic development. Using Bcor loss of function embryonic stem (ES) cells and in vitro differentiation assays, we demonstrate that Bcor plays a role in the regulation of gene expression very early in the differentiation of ES cells into ectoderm, mesoderm and downstream hematopoietic lineages. Normal expression of affected genes (Oct3/4, Nanog, Fgf5, Bmp4, Brachyury and Flk1) is restored upon re-expression of Bcor. Consistent with these ES cell results, chimeric animals generated with the same loss of function Bcor alleles show a low contribution to B and T cells and erythrocytes and have kinked and shortened tails, consistent with reduced Brachyury expression. Together these results suggest that Bcor plays a role in differentiation of multiple tissue lineages during early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>The molecular mechanism underlying somite development differs along the embryonic antero-posterior axis. In zebrafish, cell lineage tracing and genetic analysis have revealed a difference in somite development between the trunk and tail. For instance, spadetail/tbx16 (spt) mutant embryos lack trunk somites but not tail ones. Trunk and tail somites are developed from mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) located in the tailbud. While the undifferentiated state of MPCs is maintained by mutual activation between Wnt and Brachyury/Ntl, the mechanism by which the MPCs differentiate into presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells remains largely unclear. Especially, the molecules that promote PSM differentiation during tail development should be clarified. Here, we show that zebrafish embryos defective in mesogenin1 (msgn1) and spt failed to differentiate into PSM cells in tail development and show increased expression of wnt8 and ntl. Msgn1 acted in a cell-autonomous manner and as a transcriptional activator in PSM differentiation. The expression of msgn1 initially overlapped with that of ntl in the ventral tailbud, as previously reported; and its mis-expression caused ectopic expression of tbx24, a PSM marker gene, only in the tailbud and posterior notochord, both of which expressed ntl in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, the PSM-inducing activity of misexpressed msgn1 was enhanced by co-expression with ntl. Thus, Msgn1 exercised its PSM-inducing activity in cells expressing ntl. Based on these results, we speculate that msgn1 expression in association with that of ntl may allow the differentiation of progenitor cells to proceed during development of somites in the tail.</str>

      <str>Fgf signaling, mediated in part by the transcription factor Brachyury/Xbra/Ntl, plays important roles in mesoderm formation during the early development of vertebrate embryos. We have identified a zebrafish gene, spr2, which encodes a member of the Sp1-like transcription factor family. spr2 is expressed in both hypoblast and epiblast cells during late blastulation/early gastrulation, and in some mesodermal and neural tissues at later stages. Injection with spr2 mRNA enhances ntl expression and alleviates the inhibitory effect on ntl of XFD, a Xenopus dominant-negative FGF receptor. In contrast, morpholino- mediated knockdown of Spr2 activity inhibits ntl expression and reduces the inductive effect of Fgfs on ntl. We also demonstrate that Fgf signaling relays mesoderm induction activity of Nodal signaling and Spr2 is involved in this signal relay process. Furthermore, the correct spatial expression of spr2 requires Nodal, Fgf and Wnt signals. We suggest that expression of spr2 is an immediate-early response to mesoderm induction by Fgfs, which in turn regulates the expression of effector genes involved in the development of mesodermal tissues.</str>

      <str>T-domain transcription factors are involved in many different processes during embryogenesis, such as mesoderm, heart or gut development in vertebrates and in invertebrates. In insects, the following five types of T-box genes are known: brachyenteron (byn), optomotor-blind (omb), optomotor-blind-related-gene-1 (org-1), dorsocross (doc) and H15. As all these classes are present in the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the flour beetle Tribolium, the multiplicity of the five types of genes varies from dipterans to the beetle. In higher dipterans, a small cluster of three doc genes (doc1-doc3) exists, while the Tribolium genome contains a single Tc-doc gene only. Two H15 genes, Tc-H15a and Tc-H15b, are present in the Tribolium genome compared to a single H15 gene in Drosophila. We have analysed the expression and function of the Tribolium brachyenteron ortholog (Tc-byn). During embryogenesis, Tc-byn is exclusively expressed in the growth zone of the extending germband and later becomes confined to the distal proctodeum and the hindgut, a situation that parallels the expression pattern of byn in Drosophila. Tc-byn-RNAi treated embryos phenocopy Drosophila byn mutants and form no hindgut. In addition, we have characterised a regulatory element upstream of the Tc-byn transcription start site that confers specific gene expression in the developing hindgut of the Drosophila embryo. Our results demonstrate a highly conserved role for Brachyury-type transcriptional regulators in posterior gut development of insects at the level of expression, function and regulation.</str>

      <str>Malignant osseous spinal neoplasms are aggressive tumors associated with poor outcomes despite aggressive multidisciplinary measures.

      <str>The SEER registry (1973-2003) was queried to identify cases of histologically confirmed primary spinal chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma. Extent of local invasion was defined at time of care by histology, radiology, or intraoperative assessment and classified as confined (tumor within periosteum), local invasion (extension to surrounding tissues), or distal metastasis. The association of extent of local tumor invasion with overall survival was assessed by Cox analysis.</str>
      <str>One thousand eight hundred ninety-two patients were identified (414 chordoma, 579 chondrosarcoma, 430 osteosarcoma, 469 Ewing sarcoma). Overall median survival was histology specific (osteosarcoma, 11 months; Ewing sarcoma, 26 months; chondrosarcoma, 37 months; chordoma, 50 months) and correlated with extent of local tissue invasion or metastasis at presentation. Presence of metastasis was associated with marked decrease in survival (P &lt; 0.001) for all tumor types. For patients with isolated spine tumors, neoplasms confined within the periosteum were associated with improved overall survival independent of age, radiotherapy, or surgical resection for chordoma (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; P = 0.08), chondrosarcoma (HR, 0.62; P = 0.03), and osteosarcoma (HR, 0.68; P = 0.05), but not Ewing sarcoma (HR, 0.62; P = 0.27).</str>

      <str>The murine tumor suppressor p19(ARF) (p14(ARF) in humans) is thought to fulfill an important protective role in preventing primary cells from oncogenic transformation via its action in the p53 pathway. Several disease-implicated regulators of p19(ARF) are known to date, among which are the T-box genes TBX2, which resides on an amplicon in primary breast tumors, and TBX3, which is mutated in the human developmental disorder Ulnar-Mammary syndrome. Here we identify a variant T-site, matching 13 of 20 nucleotides of a consensus T-site, as the essential TBX2/TBX3-binding element in the human p14(ARF) promoter. Mutant analysis indicates that both the consensus T-box and a C-terminal conserved repression domain are essential for p14(ARF) repression. Whereas the core nucleotides required for interaction of the archetypal T-box protein Brachyury with a consensus T-site are conserved in the variant site, additional flanking nucleotides contribute to the specificity of TBX2 binding. This is illustrated by the inability of TBX1A or Xbra to activate via the variant p14(ARF) T-site. Importantly, this suggests a hitherto unsuspected level of specificity associated with T-box factors and corresponding recognition sites in regulating their target genes in vivo.</str>

      <str>A characteristic abnormality of chimeras composed of wildtype and T/T (Brachyury) mutant embryonic stem cells is the aggregation and accumulation of mutant cells in the primitive streak and its descendant, the tail bud (V. Wilson, L. Manson, W. C. Skarnes, and R. S. P. Beddington (1995). Development 121, 877-886). To demonstrate that this aberrant behaviour of mutant cells in the streak is due only to the absence of wild-type T protein and to investigate dosage effects of T function on cell deployment during gastrulation, a vector expressing T under the control of its own promoter (which results in T expression in the primitive streak but not in the notochord) was introduced into T/T mutant ES cells carrying a ubiquitous lacZ lineage marker. Four clones (TR clones) that express T appropriately in the streak and rescue abnormal chimeric morphology were recovered. In chimeras, these four clones fall into two distinct categories with respect to their ability to exit from the primitive streak and their subsequent tissue colonisation profile. TR1 and TR4 descendants no longer accumulated in the tail bud and gave rise to all types of mesoderm as well as colonising ventral neurectoderm. Interestingly, TR2 and TR5 cells (which express higher levels of T protein than TR1 and TR4 in vitro) tended to exit the streak prematurely, showed a marked reduction in posterior mesoderm colonisation, and were virtually excluded from ventral neurectoderm. However, while descendants of all four TR clones can colonise dermomyotome at all axial levels, the parent T/T mutant cells only contribute to this tissue rostral to the forelimb bud and are completely excluded from more caudal dermomyotome. These results show that the abnormal aggregation of mutant cells homozygous for the Brachyury deletion (approximately 200 kb) can be ascribed solely to the lack of wild-type T protein, as can the failure of T/T cells to colonise caudal dermomyotome. They also suggest that patterns of cell recruitment from the streak can be influenced by the level of T expression.</str>

      <str>Although largely involved in innate and adaptive immunity, NF-kappa B plays an important role in vertebrate development. In chicks, the inactivation of the NF-kappa B pathway induces functional alterations of the apical ectodermal ridge, which mediates limb outgrowth. In mice, the complete absence of NF-kappa B activity leads to prenatal death and neural tube defects. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of NF-kappa B/I kappa B proteins in zebra fish. Despite being ubiquitously expressed among the embryonic tissues, NF-kappa B/I kappa B members present distinct patterns of gene expression during the early zebra fish development. Biochemical assays indicate that zebra fish NF-kappa B proteins are able to bind consensus DNA-binding (kappa B) sites and inhibitory I kappa B alpha proteins from mammals. We show that zebra fish I kappa B alphas are degraded in a time-dependent manner after induction of transduced murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and that these proteins are able to rescue NF-kappa B activity in I kappa B alpha(-/-) MEFs. Expression of a dominant-negative form of the murine I kappa B alpha (mI kappa B alpha M), which is able to block NF-kappa B in zebra fish cells, interferes with the notochord differentiation, generating no tail (ntl)-like embryos. This phenotype can be rescued by coinjection of the T-box gene ntl (Brachyury homologue), which is typically required for the formation of posterior mesoderm and axial development, suggesting that ntl lies downstream of NF-kappa B . We further show that ntl and Brachyury promoter regions contain functional kappa B sites and NF-kappa B can directly modulate ntl expression. Our study illustrates the conservation and compatibility of NF-kappa B/I kappa B proteins among vertebrates and the importance of NF-kappa B pathway in mesoderm formation during early embryogenesis.</str>

      <str>The formation of a through-gut was a key innovation in the evolution of metazoans. There is still controversy regarding the origin of the anus and how it may have been either gained or lost during evolution in different bilaterian taxa. Thus, the study of groups with a blind gut is of great importance for understanding the evolution of this organ system. Here, we describe the morphogenesis and molecular patterning of the blind gut in the sexual triclad Schmidtea polychroa. We identify and analyze the expression of goosecoid, commonly associated with the foregut, and the GATA, ParaHox and T-box genes, members of which commonly are associated with gut regionalization. We show that GATA456a is expressed in the blind gut of triclads, while GATA456b is localized in dorsal parenchymal cells. Goosecoid is expressed in the central nervous system, and the unique ParaHox gene identified, Xlox, is detected in association with the nervous system. We have not isolated any brachyury gene in the T-box complement of S. polychroa, which consists of one tbx1/10, three tbx2/3 and one tbx20. Furthermore, the absence of genes like brachyury and caudal is also present in other groups of Platyhelminthes. This study suggests that GATA456, in combination with foxA, is a gut-specific patterning mechanism conserved in the triclad S. polychroa, while the conserved gut-associated expression of foregut, midgut and hindgut markers is absent. Based on these data and the deviations in spiral cleavage found in more basal flatworms, we propose that the lack of an anus is an innovation of Platyhelminthes. This may be associated with loss of gut gene expression or even gene loss.</str>

      <str>Definitive mesoderm arises from a bipotent mesendodermal population, and to study processes controlling its development at this stage, embryonic stem (ES) cells can be employed. SHB (Src homology 2 protein in beta-cells) is an adapter protein previously found to be involved in ES cell differentiation to mesoderm. To further study the role of SHB in this context, we have established ES cell lines deficient for one (SHB+/-) or both SHB alleles (SHB-/-). Differentiating embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from these ES cell lines were used for gene expression analysis. Alternatively, EBs were stained for the blood vessel marker CD31. For hematopoietic differentiation, EBs were differentiated in methylcellulose. SHB-/- EBs exhibited delayed down-regulation of the early mesodermal marker Brachyury. Later mesodermal markers relatively specific for the hematopoietic, vascular, and cardiac lineages were expressed at lower levels on day 6 or 8 of differentiation in EBs lacking SHB. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 was also reduced in SHB-/- EBs. SHB-/- EBs demonstrated impaired blood vessel formation after vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation. In addition, the SHB-/- ES cells formed fewer blood cell colonies than SHB+/+ ES cells. It is concluded that SHB is required for appropriate hematopoietic and vascular differentiation and that delayed down-regulation of Brachyury expression may play a role in this context.</str>

      <str>Echinoderms are the sister group of the chordates and hemichordates within the deuterostomes. They lack a notochord or any structures obviously homologous with it. To gain insight into developmental mechanisms important in the origin and early evolution of chordates, we investigated sea urchin homologues of chordate genes that are implicated in notochord formation, viz. Brachyury and HNF-3 beta. Here we report the pattern of expression of a sea urchin orthologue of forkhead, Hphnf3 which is present as a single copy per haploid genome. An Hphnf3 transcript of 3.0 kb was first detected at the swimming blastula stage, accumulated maximally at the gastrula and prism-embryo stages, and decreased at the pluteus-larva stage. In situ hybridization signals were found in cells of the vegetal plate of the swimming blastula. During gastrulation, intense staining was evident in the cells surrounding the blastopore, whereas weak staining was detected in the invaginating archenteron. At the prism-embryo stage, the entire archenteron stained intensely; then, at pluteus stage, the larva staining decreased in intensity. The forkhead and Brachyury genes begin to be expressed almost simultaneously in sea urchin embryos, in the vegetal plate at the late blastula stage. After the onset of gastrulation, however, Hphnf3 is expressed in the posterior part of the archenteron, whereas the Brachyury orthologue, HpTa, is expressed in the secondary mesenchyme founder cells, which occupy the anterior tip of archenteron. Hphnf3 may contribute to specification of embryonic cells as archenteron, and the role of HpTa may be directed towards specification of mesodermal founder cells. Except for the basal character of expression in endoderm and endomesoderm, these transcription factors are clearly utilized differently in chordates.</str>

      <str>The expression of E and D-type cyclins, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) 2 and 4, as well as CDK inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were examined during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells cultured in presence of Differentiation Inhibitory Activity/Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (DIA/LIF) express very low levels of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 CDK inhibitors, while cyclin D/CDK4-associated kinase activity is undetectable. Withdrawal of DIA/LIF, which induces differentiation, results in the progressive up-regulation of all. Up-regulation of D cyclins occurs through an increase in the steady-state levels of mRNA, concomitantly with the activation of Brachyury and Goosecoid, two early markers of mesoderm differentiation. Similarly, cells from the epiblast of the early postimplantation mouse embryo do not express any cyclin D/CDK4 complexes. These are progressively upregulated at gastrulation and early organogenesis. DIA/LIF-stimulated ES cells are not growth-arrested by overexpression of p16Ink4a, a specific inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6. We propose that the G1/S transition may be regulated by a minimal mechanism in mouse embryonic stem cells. Induction of differentiation triggers the establishment of a more sophisticated mechanism involving both cyclin D/CDK4- and CDK inhibitor-associated control of G1-phase progression.</str>

      <str>Sponges are among the earliest diverging lineage within the metazoan phyla. Although their adult morphology is distinctive, at several stages of development, they possess characteristics found in more complex animals. The T-box family of transcription factors is an evolutionarily ancient gene family known to be involved in the development of structures derived from all germ layers in the bilaterian animals. There is an incomplete understanding of the role that T-box transcription factors play in normal sponge development or whether developmental pathways using the T-box family share similarities between parazoan and eumetazoan animals. To address these questions, we present data that identify several important T-box genes in marine and freshwater sponges, place these genes in a phylogenetic context, and reveal patterns in how these genes are expressed in developing sponges. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that sponges have members of at least two of the five T-box subfamilies (Brachyury and Tbx2/3/4/5) and that the T-box genes expanded and diverged in the poriferan lineage. Our analysis of signature residues in the sponge T-box genes calls into question whether "true" Brachyury genes are found in the Porifera. Expression for a subset of the T-box genes was elucidated in larvae from the marine demosponge, Halichondria bowerbanki. Our results show that sponges regulate the timing and specificity of gene expression for T-box orthologs across larval developmental stages. In situ hybridization reveals distinct, yet sometimes overlapping expression of particular T-box genes in free-swimming larvae. Our results provide a comparative framework from which we can gain insights into the evolution of developmentally important pathways.</str>

The phospho-glycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was used to ubiquitously direct expression of histone-2B fused eGFP and mCherry proteins to the nucleus to monitor DNA content and enable tracking of cell migration and lineage. Vectors with T/Brachyury and alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoters targeted fluorescent or drug-resistance proteins to early mesoderm and cardiomyocytes. The drug selection protocol yielded 96% pure cardiomyocytes that could be cultured for over 4 months. Puromycin-selected cardiomyocytes exhibited a gene expression profile similar to that of adult human cardiomyocytes and generated force and action potentials consistent with normal fetal cardiomyocytes, documenting these parameters in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes and validating that the selected cells retained normal differentiation and function.</str>

      <str>Tenascin is a large glycoprotein which is expressed in a restricted pattern in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of vertebrate embryos. Tenascin interferes with cell-fibronectin interactions in vitro, and may play a role in the control of cell migration and differentiation during development. In Xenopus, tenascin immunoreactivity is first detected at the early tailbud stage in the ECM of the most anterior somite. Thereafter, it is distributed dorsally along neural crest cell migration pathways. In this paper, we report that tenascin mRNA is most abundant in dorsal mesoderm at the neurula stage and in somites at the early tailbud stage, indicating that the initial accumulation of tenascin in the ECM is due to secretion from paraxial mesoderm. To understand how tenascin expression in somitic mesoderm is controlled, we have expressed Xbra and the myogenic factors XMyoD and XMyf5 in blastula animal cap tissue. The tenascin gene is activated by all three transcription factors. Interestingly, expression of tenascin mRNA, and accumulation of the protein in the ECM, can occur without formation of muscle. Our results suggest that tenascin regionalization in early Xenopus embryos depends on tenascin RNA expression by somitic mesoderm, where it is likely to be activated by myogenic factors.</str>

      <str>To investigate formation of the three primary germ layers in mouse embryoid bodies (EBs), we observed changes in structure and gene expression over a 7-day culture period. We compared these changes using two methods for EB formation: hanging drop (HD) and static suspension culture (SSC). Light microscopy showed that a stratified columnar epithelial layer developed on the surface of EBs formed using the HD method. From Day 3 in culture, ultrastructural changes occurred in the aligned cellular membranes. Condensation of actin filaments was followed by formation of complicated adherent junctions and dilatation of intercellular canaliculi containing well-developed microvilli. These changes were more marked in EBs formed by the HD method than the SSC method. On Day 5 of culture, Brachyury gene expression, a marker for mesoderm formation, was detected only with the HD method. Nestin, an ectoderm marker, and Foxa2, an endoderm marker, were expressed with both methods. These results suggest that in EBs formed with the HD method, actin formation and Brachyury gene expression mark the transition from two to three primary germ layers. Additionally, the HD method promotes more rapid and complete development of mouse EBs than does the SSC method. While the SSC method is simple and easy to use, it needs improvement to form more complete EBs.</str>

      <str>goosecoid is an immediate early gene expressed at the dorsal blastoporal lip of the Xenopus gastrula. Microinjection experiments have suggested a direct role for goosecoid in organizing the dorsoventral axis of the frog embryo. Here we characterize the zebrafish homologue of goosecoid (gsc) and compare its expression to that of Brachyury or no tail (ntl), another immediate early gene required in developing mesoderm. We show that gsc exhibits two independent phases of expression: an early one in cells anterior to the presumptive notochord, but not in cells of the notochord itself, and a later one in neural crest derivatives in the larval head. Zygotic gsc transcripts are detected soon after the midblastula transition, and at the blastula stage form a gradient with a maximum at the dorsal side. Use of gsc as a dorsal marker allowed us to demonstrate that ntl expression is initially activated at the dorsal side of the blastula. At this early stage, gsc and ntl show overlapping domains of expression and are co-expressed in cells at the dorsal midline of the early gastrula. However, gsc- and ntl-expressing cells become separated in the course of gastrulation, with gsc being expressed in the axial hypoblast (prechordal plate) anterior to the ntl-expressing presumptive notochord cells. Studies with mutant embryos suggest that gsc is independent of ntl function in vivo.</str>

      <str>Patterning events that occur before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) and that organize the spatial pattern of gene expression in the animal hemisphere have been analyzed in Xenopus embryos. We present evidence that genes that play a role in dorsoventral specification display different modes of activation. Using early blastomere explants (16-128-cell stage) cultured until gastrula stages, we demonstrate by RT-PCR analysis that the expression of goosecoid (gsc), wnt-8 and brachyury (bra) is dependent on mesoderm induction. In contrast, nodal-related 3 (nr3) and siamois (sia) are expressed in a manner that is independent of mesoderm induction, however their spatially correct activation does require cortical rotation. The pattern of sia and nr3 expression reveals that the animal half of the 16-cell embryo is already distinctly polarized along the dorsoventral axis as a result of rearrangement of the egg structure during cortical rotation. Similar to the antagonistic activity between the ventral and the dorsal mesoderm, the ventral animal blastomeres can attenuate the expression of nr3 and sia in dorsal animal blastomeres. Our data suggest that no Nieuwkoop center activity at the blastula stage is required for the activation of nr3 and sia in vivo.</str>

      <str>Tissue specification in the early embryo requires the integration of spatial information at the promoters of developmentally important genes. Although several response elements for signalling pathways have been identified in Xenopus promoters, it is not yet understood what defines the sharp borders that restrict expression to a specific tissue. Here we use transgenic frog embryos to study the spatial and temporal regulation of the Xbra promoter. Deletion analysis and point mutations in putative transcription factor-binding sites identified two repressor modules, which exert their main effects at different stages during gastrulation. One module is defined by a bipartite binding site for a Smad-interacting protein (SIP1) of the deltaEF1 repressor family and acts to confine expression to the marginal zone early in gastrulation. The other module is defined by two homeodomain-binding sites and is responsible for repression in dorsal mesoderm and ectoderm at mid-gastrula stages. In addition, an upstream region of the promoter is necessary to repress expression in neural tissues later in development. Together, our results show that repression plays an important role in the restriction of Xbra expression to the mesoderm, and we suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in the spatial regulation of other genes in early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>Advancements in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) research have potential to revolutionize therapeutic transplantation. It has been demonstrated that transcription factors may play key roles in regulating maintenance, expansion, and differentiation of hPSCs. In addition to its regulatory functions in hematopoiesis and blood-related disorders, the transcription factor RUNX1 is also required for the formation of definitive blood stem cells. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of endogenous RUNX1a, an isoform of RUNX1, parallels with lineage commitment and hematopoietic emergence from hPSCs, including both human embryonic stem cells and inducible pluripotent stem cells. In a defined hematopoietic differentiation system, ectopic expression of RUNX1a facilitates emergence of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and positively regulates expression of mesoderm and hematopoietic differentiation-related factors, including Brachyury, KDR, SCL, GATA2, and PU.1. HPCs derived from RUNX1a hPSCs show enhanced expansion ability, and the ex vivo-expanded cells are capable of differentiating into multiple lineages. Expression of RUNX1a in embryoid bodies (EBs) promotes definitive hematopoiesis that generates erythrocytes with β-globin production. Moreover, HPCs generated from RUNX1a EBs possess ≥9-week repopulation ability and show multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. Together, our results suggest that RUNX1a facilitates the process of producing therapeutic HPCs from hPSCs.</str>

      <str>The heart is the first organ to form and function in the vertebrate embryo. Furthermore, differences between the left and right sides of the embryo become first detectable during cardiac development. We observed strong cardiac laterality phenotypes in medaka embryos by manipulating Groucho protein activity. The phenotypes produced by misexpressing Tle4 and the dominant-negative Aes reveal a general effect of these corepressor proteins on left-right (LR) development. With the help of an inducible expression system, we were able to define temporally different phases for these effects. In an early phase during gastrulation, Groucho proteins regulate Brachyury expression in the dorsal forerunner cells, which later gives rise to the Kupffer's vesicle (KV). The interference of endogenous Groucho proteins by misexpression of Aes leads to KVs of reduced size, whereas overexpression of Tle4 results in enlarged KVs. The expression level of the cilia marker Lrd was also affected both positively and negatively from these treatments. In the late phase during somitogenesis, Groucho proteins regulate the asymmetric activities of Nodal and Lefty genes. Altering canonical Wnt signaling produced similar results in late embryos, however, this did not affect KV morphogenesis or Lrd expression in early embryos. Therefore, changes in Kupffer's vesicle morphogenesis and the laterality of visceral organs following alterations in Groucho corepressor levels demonstrate two distinct phases in which Groucho proteins help establish LR asymmetry in medaka fish.</str>

Immunohistochemical analysis of sectioned embryos indicated that Bmp-4 protein was depleted and gene expression analysis indicated there was a reduction in Bmp-4 mRNA and an upregulation of the Bmp-4 antagonists, noggin and chordin, in embryos exposed to the shRNA, but not in control embryos. There was no change in the expression of Gata4, brachyury, or claudin6 in RNAi exposed embryos, indicating that RNA silencing was specific to Bmp-4 rather than producing widespread gene inhibition.

      <str>The murine Brachyury (T) gene is required in mesoderm formation. Mutants carrying different T alleles show a graded severity of defects correlated with gene dosage along the body axis. The phenotypes range from shortening of the tail to the malformation of sacral vertebrae in heterozygotes, and to disruption of trunk development and embryonic death in homozygotes. Defects include a severe disturbance of the primitive streak, an early cessation of mesoderm formation and absence of the allantois and notochord, the latter resulting in an abnormality of the neural tube and somites. The T gene is expressed in nascent mesoderm and in the notochord of wild-type embryos. Here the expression of T in whole-mount mutant embryos homozygous for the T allele TWis is described. The TWis gene product is altered, but the TWis/TWis phenotype is very similar to that of T/T embryos which lack T. In early TWis/TWis embryos T expression is normal, but ceases prematurely during early organogenesis coincident with a cessation of mesoderm formation. The archenteron/node region is disrupted and the extension of the notochord precursor comes to a halt, followed by a decrease and finally a complete loss of T gene expression in the primitive streak and the head process/notochord precursor. It appears that the primary defect of the mutant embryo is the disruption of the notochord precursor in the node region which is required for axis elongation. Thus the T gene product is directly or indirectly involved in the organization of axial development.</str>

      <str>Expansible and lobular soft tissue masses were mainly present, with irregular intratumor calcification in all 5 cases on CT examination. MR imaging revealed a well-defined tumor with heterogeneous signal intensity in 4 patients, whereas homogeneous signal intensity in 1 patient was present on all pulse sequences. Four cases of nasopharyngeal mass showed mild to moderate heterogenous enhancement. Intratumor septa could be seen in 2 cases.</str>
      <str>Although no imaging features are pathognomonic, primary chordomas without skull base (clivus) bony changes in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx have some CT and MR imaging findings that are suggestive of diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of the soft tissue mass should be limited to these sites.</str>

      <str>En bloc wide-margin excision significantly decreases the risk of chordoma recurrence. However, a wide surgical margin cannot be obtained in many chordomas because they arise primarily in the sacrum, clivus, and mobile spine.

      <str>Twenty-four patients with chordoma of the sacrum and mobile spine were treated with high-dose single-fraction SRS (median dose, 2400 cGy). Twenty-one primary and 3 metastatic tumors were treated. Seven patients were treated for postoperative tumor recurrence. In 7 patients, SRS was administered as planned adjuvant therapy, and in 13 patients, SRS was administered as neoadjuvant therapy. All patients had serial magnetic resonance imaging follow-up.</str>
      <str>The overall median follow-up was 24 months. Of the 24 patients, 23 (95%) demonstrated stable or reduced tumor burden based on serial magnetic resonance imaging. One patient had radiographic progression of tumor 11 months after SRS. Only 6 of 13 patients who underwent neoadjuvant SRS proceeded to surgery. This decision was based on the lack of radiographic progression and the patient's preference. Complications were limited to 1 patient in whom sciatic neuropathy developed and 1 with vocal cord paralysis.</str>

      <str>Previous studies of chordoma have focused on either surgery, radiotherapy, or particular tumor locations. This paper reviewed the outcomes of surgery and proton radiotherapy with various tumor locations. Between 2001 and 2008, 40 patients with chordomas of the skull base and cervical spine had surgery at our hospital. Most patients received proton therapy. Their clinical course was reviewed. Age, sex, tumor location, timing of surgery, extent of resection, and chondroid appearance were evaluated in regard to the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The primary surgery (PS) group was analyzed independently. The extensive resection rate was 42.5%. Permanent neurological morbidity was seen in 3.8%. Radiotherapy was performed in 75% and the mean dose was 68.9 cobalt gray equivalents. The median follow-up was 56.5 months. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 70% and 83.4%, respectively. Metastasis was seen in 12.5%. The tumor location at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ) was associated with a lower PFS (P = 0.007). In the PS group, a younger age and the CCJ location were related to a lower PFS (P = 0.008 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The CCJ location was also related to a lower OS (P = 0.043) and it was more common in young patients (P = 0.002). Among the survivors, the median of the last Karnofsky Performance Scale score was 80 with 25.7% of patients experiencing an increase and 11.4% experiencing a decrease. Multimodal surgery and proton therapy thus improved the chordoma treatment. The CCJ location and a younger age are risks for disease progression.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are locally destructive tumors with high rates of recurrence, and therapeutic strategies remain controversial. This study analyzed long-term outcomes for clival chordomas after initial aggressive surgical resection and gamma knife radiosurgery for recurrence and investigated clinical factors predicting recurrence.</str>
      <str>Clinical records were reviewed for 19 consecutive patients (11 men, 8 women; mean age, 43.1 years) with clival chordoma who underwent initial surgical resection using skull base approaches (mean follow-up after surgical resection, 87.2 months). All tumors were aggressively removed, along with the surrounding bone. Four patients were treated with radiotherapy after surgical resection.Recurrent lesions were treated with gamma knife radio surgery or reoperation. Factors predicting tumor recurrence were analyzed, including age, tumor extension, extent of resection and MIB-1 labeling index. Patient status was evaluated using the Karnofsky performance scale (KPS).</str>
      <str>Tumor resection was total, subtotal and partial in 14, 4 and 1 patients, respectively. Tumors recurred in 11 patients. Overall, 2- and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 77.9% and 47.9%, respectively. The MIB-1 labeling index was independently associated with recurrence.The optimum cutoff point for the MIB-1 labeling index was 3.44%. All recurrent tumors were totally resected or controlled by gamma knife (mean follow-up after recurrence, 71.2 months). All patients survived and were active (mean KPS at final follow-up, 89.5%).</str>
      <str>Long-term control of clival chordomas was achieved. Recurrent tumors were controlled with gamma knife radiosurgery, since lesions were localized and small after initial aggressive resection. The MIB-1 labeling index can provide important information for predicting tumor recurrence.</str>

      <str>A sacral chordoma is a rare, slow-growing, primary bone tumor, arising from embryonic notochordal remnants. Radical surgery is the only hope for cure. The aim of our present study is to analyse our experience with the challenging treatment of this rare tumor, to review current treatment modalities and to assess the outcome based on R status.</str>
      <str>Eight patients were treated in our institution between 2001 and 2011. All patients were discussed by a multidisciplinary tumor board, and an en bloc surgical resection by posterior perineal access only or by combined anterior/posterior accesses was planned based on tumor extension.</str>
      <str>Seven patients underwent radical surgery, and one was treated by using local cryotherapy alone due to low performance status. Three misdiagnosed patients had primary surgery at another hospital with R1 margins. Reresection margins in our institution were R1 in two and R0 in one, and all three recurred. Four patients were primarily operated on at our institution and had en bloc surgery with R0 resection margins. One had local recurrence after 18 months. The overall morbidity rate was 86% (6/7 patients) and was mostly related to the perineal wound. Overall, 3 out of 7 resected patients were disease-free at a median follow-up of 2.9 years (range, 1.6-8.0 years).</str>
      <str>Our experience confirms the importance of early correct diagnosis and of an R0 resection for a sacral chordoma invading pelvic structures. It is a rare disease that requires a challenging multidisciplinary treatment, which should ideally be performed in a tertiary referral center.</str>

      <str>Prospective analysis of local tumor control, survival, and treatment complications in 44 consecutive patients treated with fractionated photon and proton radiation for a chordoma or chondrosarcoma of the skull base.</str>
      <str>Between December 1995 and December 1998, 45 patients with a median age of 55 years (14-85) were treated using a 201-MeV proton beam at the Centre de Protonthérapie d'Orsay, 34 for a chordoma and 11 for a chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two-thirds of the total dose and protons one-third. The median total dose delivered within the gross tumor volume was 67 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) (range: 60-70).</str>
      <str>With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 2-56), the 3-year local control rates for chordomas and chondrosarcomas were 83.1% and 90%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients (18%) failed locally (7 within the clinical tumor volume and 1 unknown). Four patients died of tumor and 2 others of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, young age at time of radiotherapy influenced local control positively (p &lt; 0.03), but not in multivariate analysis. Only 2 patients presented Grade 3 or 4 complications.</str>
      <str>In skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas, the combination of photons with a proton boost of one-third the total dose offers an excellent chance of cure at the price of an acceptable toxicity. These results should be confirmed with a longer follow-up.</str>

      <str>Postoperative radiation is often given in cases of cervical chordoma because of the high incidence of local recurrence. The tumor mass usually surrounds the spinal cord and infiltrates vertebral bone. A combined technique using protons or electrons to boost the initial photon fields is generally applied. We evaluated the use of dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy as an alternative technique for treating advanced cervical chordoma.</str>
      <str>A female patient with incomplete resection of a vertebral chordoma surrounding C2-C3 was irradiated with a total dose of 58 Gy (ICRU point) in 2 Gy daily fractions for 29 days between December 2001 and January 2002. Beam arrangement consisted of seven 6 MV non-opposed coplanar fields. Pretreatment quality assurance included checking of the absolute dose at reference points and 2D dose map analysis. Treatment was delivered with a 120-leaf collimator in sliding window mode. To verify the daily setup, portal images at 0 degrees and 90 degrees were compared with the simulation images before treatment delivery (manual matching) and after treatment delivery (automatic anatomy matching).</str>
      <str>The mean dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 57.6 +/- 2.1 Gy covering 95% of the PTV per 95% isodose. The minimum dose to the PTV (D99) was 53.6 Gy in the overlapping area between the PTV and the spinal cord planning organ at risk volume (PRV). The maximum dose to the spinal cord was 42.2 Gy and to the spinal cord PRV (8 mm margin) 53.7 Gy. The mean dose to the parotid glands was 37.4 Gy (homolateral gland) and 19.5 Gy (contralateral gland). Average deviation in setup was -1.1 +/- 2.5 mm (anterior-posterior), 2.4 +/- 1.3 mm (latero-lateral), 0.7 +/- 0.9 mm (craniocaudal) and -0.43 +/- 1 degree (rotation).</str>
      <str>In the treatment of chordomas surrounding the spinal cord, intensity-modulated radiotherapy can provide high dose homogeneity and PTV coverage.

      <str>When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.</str>
      <str>132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.</str>
      <str>Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.</str>
      <str>This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.</str>

      <str>The metanephric kidney is a mesodermal organ that develops as a result of reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the blastema. The generation of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived progenitors offers potential for regenerative therapies but is often limited by development of tumor formation. Because brachyury (T) denotes mesoderm specification, a mouse ES cell line with green fluorescence protein (GFP) knocked into the functional T locus as well as lacZ in the ROSA26 locus (LacZ/T/GFP) was used in cell selection and lineage tracing. In the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, mouse ES cells give rise to embryoid bodies that can differentiate into mesoderm. Culture conditions were optimized (4 d, 10 ng/ml Activin-A) to generate maximal numbers of renal progenitor populations identified by expression of the specific combination of renal markers cadherin-11, WT-1, Pax-2, and Wnt-4. LacZ/T/GFP+ cells were further enriched by FACS selection. Five days after injection of LacZ/T/GFP+ cells into embryonic kidney explants in organ culture, beta-galactosidase immunohistochemistry showed incorporation into blastemal cells of the nephrogenic zone. After a single injection into developing live newborn mouse kidneys, co-localization studies showed that the LacZ/T/GFP+ cells were stably integrated into proximal tubules with normal morphology and normal polarization of alkaline phosphatase and aquaporin-1 for 7 mo, without teratoma formation. It is concluded that defined differentiation of ES cells into embryoid bodies with Activin-A and selection for T expression provides a means to isolate and purify renal proximal tubular progenitor cells with the potential for safe use in regenerative therapies.</str>

      <str>The murine developmental mutation T identifies a gene required in mesoderm formation. T/T mutant embryos develop normally to the primitive streak stage; during early organogenesis they show insufficient mesoderm and absence of the notochord. The mutants die at around 10 days of gestation because of the lack of the allantois. We have localized the T mutation relative to DNA markers and used a combination of genetic and molecular techniques to clone the T gene. Expression of the T gene is restricted to nascent mesoderm and to the notochord, the tissues most strongly affected by the mutation. Recent results suggest that the T gene encodes a nuclear factor involved in establishing notochord cell identity and differentiation, and is directly or indirectly involved in the organization of axial development.</str>

      <str>The zebrafish T-box transcription factors spadetail (spt) and the brachyury ortholog no tail (ntl) are together essential for posterior mesoderm formation. In addition to being functionally redundant, spt and ntl also genetically interact with zygotic mutant alleles of one-eyed pinhead (Zoep), leading to synergistic mesodermal defects. Here we have used genetic and pharmacological assays to address the mechanism of these interactions. We show that Zoep and ntl are together required upstream of spt expression, accounting for the severity of the mesodermal defects in Zoep;ntl embryos. Since Xenopus brachyury is proposed to regulate fgf expression, and FGF signaling is required for spt expression, we analyzed the involvement of the FGF signaling pathway in these genetic interactions. Using a specific inhibitor of FGFR activity to indirectly assay the strength of FGF signaling in individual embryos, we found that spt and ntl mutant embryos were both hypersensitive to the FGFR inhibitor. This hypersensitivity is consistent with the possibility that Spt and Ntl function upstream of FGF signaling. Furthermore, we show that minor pharmacological or genetic perturbations in FGF signaling are sufficient to dramatically enhance the Zoep mutant phenotype, providing a plausible explanation for why Zoep genetically interacts with spt and ntl. Finally, we show that Zoep and ace/fgf8 function are essential for the formation of all posterior tissues, including spinal cord. Taken together, our data provide strong in vivo support for the regulation of FGF signaling by T-box transcription factors, and the cooperative activity of Oep and FGF signaling during the formation of posterior structures.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are low to intermediate grade malignancies that arise from remnants of embryonic notochord. They often recur after surgery and are highly resistant to conventional adjuvant therapies. Recently, the development of effective targeted molecular therapy has been investigated in chordomas that show receptors for tyrosine kinase (RTKs) activation. Expression of specific RTKs such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) in chordomas may offer valuable therapeutic options. We investigated changes in copy number of chromosome 7 and correlated it with EGFR gene status and EGFR and c-MET protein expression in 22 chordoma samples. Chromosome 7 copy number was evaluated by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and protein expression of EGFR and c-MET by immunohistochemistry. Tumors mostly showed conventional histopathologic features and were found mainly in sacral (41%) and cranial sites (54.5%). Aneusomy of chromosome 7 was seen in 73% of the samples, 62% of primary tumors and in all recurrent chordomas. EGFR and c-MET were both expressed, but only c-MET protein expression was significantly correlated with chromosome 7 aneusomy (P ≤ 0.001). c-MET overexpression may represent an early chromosome 7 alteration that could play an important role during chordoma pathogenesis. c-MET overexpression shows promise as a molecular marker of response to targeted molecular therapy in the treatment of chordomas.</str>

Complete resection prolonged median overall survival (OS) (p = 0.04). Male patients presented with worse PFS (4.8 years vs 9.8 years; p = 0.04) and OS (8.3 years vs not reached; p = 0.03) even though complete resection was exclusively achieved in the male subpopulation. Multivariate analysis confirmed male sex as the most important risk factor for tumor progression (p = 0.04) and death (p = 0.02).

      <str>Chordomas are malignant tumors with lobulated structure which usually consists of vacuolated physaliferous cells in a mucoid stroma (Enzinger et al. 1969). These cells originate from remnants of the chorda dorsalis. Most chordomas are located either at the end of the vertebral column, i.e., in the sacrococcygeal region or at the base of the skull near the sphenooccipital synchondrosis. More than half of all tumors are located in the sacrococcygeal region. In contrast to most cases of sacrococcygeal chordomas which show a predominant presacral tumor infiltration we report on a patient suffering from a sacrococcygeal chordoma with a retrosacral tumor mass. Here, the presacral tumor infiltration became apparent only much latter. It was nevertheless of great prognostic relevance as tumor infiltration of the urinary bladder lead to lethal septicaemia.</str>

      <str>Eukaryotic chromosomes contain specialized structures at the termini called telomeres. This region of DNA is required for replication and stability of the chromosome. Telomere reduction can contribute to genetic instability and has been described in certain malignancies (e.g., colon, leukemia, giant cell tumor of bone). To determine whether telomere reduction is a generalized phenomenon in malignancies, the telomere integrity of genomic DNA isolated from tumor cells was determined from 39 individuals with 15 different malignancies categorized as musculoskeletal, epithelial, cranial, or other, and peripheral blood leukocytes from the same patient, when possible, or age-matched controls. Significant telomere reduction occurred randomly across histopathologic groups including giant cell tumor of bone, glioblastoma, colon cancer, and Wilms' tumor while telomere elongation occurred in chordoma. The other remaining 10 malignancies do not show significant differences in telomere lengths compared with controls.</str>

      <str>Malignant transformation of benign neoplasm after radiosurgery is usually diagnosed based on the initial presence of benign tumor, its exposure to ionizing radiation, elapsed time from radiation exposure to malignant progression, and different histological characteristics or growth rate of the regrowing tumor comparing with those originally treated. Three presented cases fulfilled these diagnostic criteria; however, it seems that progression of the tumors (schwannoma, meningioma, chordoma) resulted from the natural course of the disease, rather than represented side effects of gamma knife radiosurgery. Evaluation of the proliferative potential of the benign neoplasm before radiosurgical treatment either directly, if tumor sampling is available, or indirectly, by calculation of the tumor growth rate and/or analysis of the data of the metabolic imaging (PET, MRS) is important for identification of "aggressive" subtypes, precise prediction of prognosis, and confirmation of the radiation-induced malignant transformation in cases of tumor regrowth.</str>

      <str>Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of peptide growth factors are widely expressed in the germ layer derivatives during gastrulation and early organogenesis of the mouse. We have investigated the effect of administering recombinant FGF-4 in the late-primitive streak stage embryo to test if the patterning of the body plan may be influenced by this growth factor. Shortly after FGF treatment the embryonic tissues up-regulated the expression of Brachyury and the RTK signaling regulator Spry2, suggesting that FGF signaling was activated as an immediate response to exogenous FGF. Concomitantly, Hesx1 expression was suppressed in the prospective anterior region of the embryo. After 24 h of in vitro development, embryos displayed a dosage-related suppression of forebrain morphogenesis, disruption of the midbrain-hindbrain partition, and inhibition of the differentiation of the embryonic mesoderm. Overall, development of the anterior-posterior axis in the late gastrula is sensitive to the delivery of exogenous FGF-4. The early response associated with the expression of Spry2 suggests that the later phenotype observed could be primarily related to an inhibition of the FGF signaling pathway.</str>

      <str>The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is associated with extensive changes in gene expression. It is not yet clear whether these changes are the result of binary switch-like mechanisms or that of continuous and progressive variation. Here, I have used immunostaining and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess changes in the expression of the well-known pluripotency-associated gene Pou5f1 (also known as Oct4) and early differentiation markers Sox1 and T-brachyury in single cells during the early steps of differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. I found extensive overlap between the expression of Pou5f1/Sox1 or Pou5f1/T-brachyury shortly after the initiation of differentiation towards either the neuronal or the mesendodermal lineage, but no evidence of correlation between their respective expression levels. Quantitative analysis of transcriptional output at the sites of nascent transcription revealed that Pou5f1 and Sox1 were transcribed in pulses and that embryonic stem cell differentiation was accompanied by changes in pulsing frequencies. The progressive induction of Sox1 was further associated with an increase in the average size of individual transcriptional bursts. Surprisingly, single cells that actively and simultaneously transcribe both the pluripotency- and the lineage-associated genes could easily be found in the differentiating population. The results presented here show for the first time that lineage priming can occur in cells that are actively transcribing a pluripotent marker. Furthermore, they suggest that this process is associated with changes in transcriptional dynamics. Stem Cells 2015;33:2949-2960. </str>

      <str>Early degenerative changes in the nucleus pulposus (NP) are observed after the disappearance of notochordal cells (NCs). Thus, it has been suggested that NCs play an important role in maintaining the NP and may have a regenerative potential on other cells of the NP. As the number of resident NP cells (NPCs) decreases in a degenerating disc, mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) may be used for cell supplementation. In this study, using cells of one species, the regenerative potential of canine NCs was assessed in long-term three-dimensional coculture with canine NPCs or MSCs.</str>
      <str>Canine NCs and canine NPCs or MSCs were cocultured in alginate beads for 28 days under hypoxic and high-osmolarity conditions. Cell viability, cell morphology and DNA content, extracellular matrix production and expression of genes related to NC markers (Brachyury, KRT18) and NP matrix production (ACAN, COL2A1, COL1A1) were assessed after 1, 15 and 28 days of culture.</str>
      <str>NCs did not completely maintain their phenotype (morphology, matrix production, gene expression) during 28 days of culture. In cocultures of NPCs and NCs, both extracellular matrix content and anabolic gene expression remained unchanged compared with monoculture groups, whereas cocultures of MSCs and NCs showed increased glycosaminoglycan/DNA. However, the deposition of these proteoglycans was observed near the NCs and not the MSCs. Brachyury expression in the MSC and NC coculture group increased in time. The latter two findings indicate a trophic effect of MSCs on NCs rather than vice versa.</str>
      <str>No regenerative potential of canine NCs on canine NPCs or MSCs was observed in this study. However, significant changes in NC phenotype in long-term culture may have resulted in a suboptimal regenerative potential of these NCs.

      <str>The widespread expression of the Xenopus homeobox gene Xhox3 in zebrafish was performed by microinjection of synthetic Xhox3 mRNA into uncleaved fertilized eggs and resulted in embryos displaying varying degrees of anterior-posterior (A-P) axis disruption. The phenotype observed was dose-dependent and showed anomalies, mainly in neural keel development, from microphthalmia to acephaly. Injection of 5 pg to 10 pg of mRNA caused a range of phenotypes in prim 5 stage embryos from normal to acephalic. Anomalies have been categorized according to an index of axis deficiency (Zf-IAD). We further characterized the axis disturbance by analyzing the expression of two genes implicated in axis formation: engrailed (eng) and brachyury (ntl). eng could not be detected in the muscle pioneer cells of embryos injected with Xhox3. The pattern distribution of brachyury (Ntl) protein is abnormal in Xhox3 injected embryos. Evidence for the conservation of the NH2 terminal region of the Xhox3 protein in frogs and fish is provided by the detection of a nuclear Xhox3-like protein in 24 h zebrafish embryos located in posterior mesoderm tissue. Previous results in Xenopus embryo research and the data presented here support the conservation of an A-P patterning mechanism involving the Xhox3 gene.</str>

      <str>During the early vertebrate body plan formation, convergent extension (CE) of dorsal mesoderm and neurectoderm is coordinated by the evolutionarily conserved non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling. Disheveled (Dvl), a key mediator of Wnt/PCP signaling, is essential for the medial-lateral polarity formation in the cells undergoing convergent extension movements. NEDD4L, a highly conserved HECT type E3 ligase, has been reported to regulate the stability of multiple substrates including Dvl2. Here we demonstrate that NEDD4L is required for the cellular polarity formation and convergent extension in the early Xenopus embryos. Depletion of NEDD4L in early Xenopus embryos results in the loss of mediolateral polarity of the convergent-extending mesoderm cells and the shortened body axis, resembling those defects caused by the disruption of non-canonical Wnt signaling. Depletion of xNEDD4L also blocks the elongation of the animal explants in response to endogenous mesoderm inducing signals and partially compromises the expression of Brachyury. Importantly, reducing Dvl2 expression can largely rescue the cellular polarity and convergent extension defects in NEDD4L-depleted embryos and explants. Together with the data that NEDD4L reduces Dvl2 protein expression in the frog embryos, our findings suggest that regulation of Dvl protein levels by NEDD4L is essential for convergent extension during early Xenopus embryogenesis. </str>

      <str>Cellular differentiation and lineage commitment are considered to be robust and irreversible processes during development. Recent work has shown that mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors. We hypothesized that combinatorial expression of chondrocyte-specific transcription factors could directly convert human placental cells into chondrocytes. Starting from a pool of candidate genes, we identified a combination of only five genes (5F pool)-BCL6, T (also called BRACHYURY), c-MYC, MITF, and BAF60C (also called SMARCD3)-that rapidly and efficiently convert postnatal human chorion and decidual cells into chondrocytes. The cells generated expressed multiple cartilage-specific genes, such as Collagen type II α1, LINK PROTEIN-1, and AGGRECAN, and exhibited characteristics of cartilage both in vivo and in vitro. Expression of the endogenous genes for T and MITF was initiated, implying that the cell conversion is due to not only the forced expression of the transgenes, but also to cellular reprogramming by the transgenes. This direct conversion system from noncartilage tissue to cartilaginous tissue is a substantial advance toward understanding cartilage development, cell-based therapy, and oncogenesis of chondrocytes.</str>

      <str>The vertebrate somite is the source of all trunk skeletal muscles. Myogenesis in avian embryos is thought to depend on signals from notochord and neural tube for the epaxial muscles, and signals from lateral mesoderm and surface ectoderm for the hypaxial muscles. However, this hypothesis has to be tested because in mouse mutants lacking a notochord the presence of a fused myotome beneath the neural tube has been reported. We have compared the expression pattern of myogenic markers and markers for the hypaxial muscle precursors in the mutants Brachyury curtailed, truncate, Danforth's short tail and Pintail. In regions lacking notochord and sclerotome, we found small, ventrally located domains of Myf5 and MyoD expression, concomitant with ventrally expanded Pax3 signals and upregulated expression of the hypaxial marker Lbx1, suggesting that only the hypaxial program is active. We therefore hypothesise that in mammals, as in birds, the formation of the epaxial musculature depends on the presence of notochord derived signals.</str>

      <str>The T (Brachyury) gene, which encodes a transcription factor, is involved in the formation of posterior mesoderm. Although studies in Xenopus have shown that T gene expression is responsive to mesoderm inducing factors and furthermore suggest the existence of an autoregulatory loop involving T itself, eFGF, and the FGF receptor, little is known about the regulation of T expression in the mouse. We report here that in the mouse the expression of fgf-4, the putative homologue of Xenopus efgf, is not dependent on the presence of T protein during the first 48 hr of gastrulation. Furthermore, we address the question of autoregulation using a chimeric approach. Introduction of a T promoter-lacZ construct into T/T ES cells results in T promoter activity in the primitive streak and tail bud in the absence of functional T protein. Therefore, we suggest that a direct FGF and T autoregulatory loop is unlikely to operate during gastrulation and axis elongation in the mouse.</str>

      <str>A major challenge facing the development of effective cell therapies is the efficient differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into pure populations. Lowering oxygen tension to physiological levels can affect both the expansion and differentiation stages. However, to date, there are no studies investigating the knock-on effect of culturing PSCs under low oxygen conditions on subsequent lineage commitment at ambient oxygen levels. PSCs were passaged three times at 2% O2 before allowing cells to spontaneously differentiate as embryoid bodies (EBs) in high oxygen (20% O2) conditions. Maintenance of mouse PSCs in low oxygen was associated with a significant increase in the expression of early differentiation markers FGF5 and Eomes, while conversely we observed decreased expression of these genes in human PSCs. Low oxygen preconditioning primed mouse PSCs for their subsequent differentiation into mesodermal and endodermal lineages, as confirmed by increased gene expression of Eomes, Goosecoid, Brachyury, AFP, Sox17, FoxA2, and protein expression of Brachyury, Eomes, Sox17, FoxA2, relative to high oxygen cultures. The effects extended to the subsequent formation of more mature mesodermal lineages. We observed significant upregulation of cardiomyocyte marker Nkx2.5, and critically a decrease in the number of contaminant pluripotent cells after 12 days using a directed cardiomyocyte protocol. However, the impact of low oxygen preconditioning was to prime human cells for ectodermal lineage commitment during subsequent EB differentiation, with significant upregulation of Nestin and β3-tubulin. Our research demonstrates the importance of oxygen tension control during cell maintenance on the subsequent differentiation of both mouse and human PSCs, and highlights the differential effects. </str>

      <str>In the present study, we show that insulin accelerates early morphogenesis in gastrulating chick embryo explants cultured in vitro, whereas antiserum to insulin adversely affects this process. Comparison between length of body axis of control and treated embryos clearly brings out the significant acceleration of development by excess insulin (0.175 to 17.5 nM). In embryos treated with 87.5 and 175 nM insulin, a high occurrence of abnormalities is observed. Treatment of embryos with antiserum to porcine insulin results in a high percentage of abnormalities, particularly in the forming neural tube. In situ hybridization of whole embryos using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes showed that insulin modifies the expression of crucial developmental genes within 2 hours. While Brachyury, a pan-mesodermal marker gene, ERNI, the earliest known marker for neural induction in chick, and noggin, important in neural tube patterning, are upregulated, expression of goosecoid, necessary for gastrulation movements, does not appear to be significantly altered. During the same time, insulin does not exert any mitogenic effect on chick embryonic cells as assessed by nuclear counts. These findings demonstrate that insulin plays an important role in the early morphogenesis of the chick embryo. The function of insulin appears to be mediated by specific genes which orchestrate pattern formation during early development.</str>

      <str>Mutations in the T-box gene Brachyury have well known effects on invagination of the endomesodermal layer during gastrulation, but the gene also plays a role in the determination of left/right axis determination that is less well studied. Previous work has implicated node morphology in this effect. We use the T(Wis) allele of Brachyury to investigate the molecular and morphological effects of the T locus on axis determination in the mouse.</str>
      <str>Similar to embryos mutant for the T allele, T(Wis) /T(Wis) embryos have a high incidence of ventral and/or reversed heart looping. In addition, heterotaxia between the direction of heart looping and the direction of embryo turning is common. Scanning electron microscopy reveals defects in node morphology including irregularity, smaller size, and a decreased number of cilia, although the cilia appear morphologically normal. Molecular analysis shows a loss of perinodal expression of genes involved in Nodal signaling, namely Cer2, Gdf1, and Nodal itself. There is also loss of Dll1 expression, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, in the presomitic mesoderm.</str>
      <str>Morphological abnormalities of the node as well as disruptions of the molecular cascade of left/right axis determination characterize T(Wis) /T(Wis) mutants. Decreased Notch signaling may account for both the morphological defects and the absence of expression of genes in the Nodal signaling pathway.</str>

      <str>The mouse T (Brachyury) gene is required for early mesodermal patterning. Mice homozygous for mutations in T die at midgestation and display defects in mesodermal tissues such as the notochord, the allantois and the somitic mesoderm. To examine the role of T in patterning of somitic and posterior mesoderm along the anterior-posterior axis, we have examined the expression of a panel of molecular markers normally localized to the sub-set of cell types affected in TWis mutant mice. Through the use of whole-mount antibody double labelling techniques, we have analysed the spatial relationships of distinct mesodermal populations relative to cells expressing the T protein. We have also examined the consequences of the TWis mutation on mesodermal populations recognised by these markers. We demonstrate that TWis homozygous mutants retain the ability to form notochordal precursor cells, as identified both by the T antibody and the expression of sonic hedgehog/vertebrate homolog of hedgehog 1 (Shh/vhh-1) and goosecoid, however, these cells fail to proliferate or differentiate. These early notochordal defects appear to result in aberrant somitic differentiation as revealed by the distribution of mox-1 protein and twist RNA expression. Moreover, twist expression in paraxial mesoderm appears to be dependent on normal T activity, while Shh/vhh-1, goosecoid, mox-1 and cdx-4 are not T dependent. We propose that T is required for the maintenance of notochordal tissue and subsequent signals required for somite differentiation.</str>

      <str>Fifty patients (56% male) with median age of 59 years (range, 8-76) were newly diagnosed with clival chordoma of mean diameter 3.3 cm (range, 1.5-6.7). Symptoms included headaches (38%), diplopia (36%), and dysphagia (14%). Procedures included transsphenoidal (n = 34), transoral (n = 4), craniotomy (n = 5), and staged approaches (n = 7). Gross total resection (GTR) rate was 52%, with 83% mean volumetric reduction, values that improved over time. While the lower third of the clivus was the least likely superoinferior zone to contain tumor (upper third = 72%/middle third = 82%/lower third = 42%), it most frequently contained residual tumor (upper third = 33%/middle third = 38%/lower third = 63%; P &lt; .05). Symptom improvement rates were 61% (diplopia) and 53% (headache). Postoperative radiation included proton beam (n = 19), cyberknife (n = 7), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (n = 6), external beam (n = 10), and none (n = 4). At last follow-up of 47 patients, 23 (49%) remain disease-free or have stable residual tumor. Lower third of clivus progressed most after GTR (upper/mid/lower third = 32%/41%/75%). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, male gender (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.2/P = .03), subtotal resection (HR = 5.0/P = .02), and the preoperative presence of tumor in the middle third (HR = 1.2/P = .02) and lower third (HR = 1.8/P = .02) of the clivus increased further growth or regrowth, while radiation modality did not.</str>
      <str>Our findings underscore long-standing support for GTR as reducing chordoma recurrence. The lower third of the clivus frequently harbored residual or recurrent tumor, despite staged approaches providing mediolateral (transcranial + endonasal) or superoinferior (endonasal + transoral) breadth. There was no benefit of proton-based over photon-based radiation, contradicting conventional presumptions.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are slow-growing, malignant tumors of bone that are thought to be derived from the primitive notochord and occur almost exclusively in the axial skeleton. The so-called extra-axial chordoma has been shown to demonstrate identical features to the classic chordoma, except that it is found outside the axial skeleton. Only six cases of extra-axial chordoma have been reported in the literature to date. In this report, we present another case of extra-axial chordoma for the first time originating from the lung parenchyma. A 79-year-old man presented a 7.3-cm-sized cavitary lung mass. Pathologic examination, including immunohistochemical studies, revealed that the mass was a chordoma. We report an extra-axial chordoma for the first time presenting as a lung mass.</str>

      <str>Twelve cases of the chordoma, including 4 cases with metastases, have been examined by light and electron microscopy for a comparison with 5 cases of the human notochord. Observed similarities in the histological and ultrastructural characteristics of the chordoma with those of the notochord suggested the histogenetic origin of the chordoma from the remnant of notochord. A "diffuse pattern" that was seen in the histological appearance of 4 cases of the chordoma, including 2 cases with metastases, was not observed in the notochord and was considered to indicate the malignant nature of such chordoma. Electron microscopy of the physaliphorous cells characteristic of the chordoma demonstrated intracytoplasmic large vacuoles containing glycogen.</str>

      <str>Twenty-two patients with primary tumors of the sacrum were surgically treated between 1983 and 1997. Seventeen male and 5 female patients were followed up for a mean of 53.6 months (range 12-203 months). The histopathologic diagnoses were giant cell tumor (GCT) in 7 patients, chordoma in 4 patients, aneurysmal bone tumor in 3 patients, chondrosarcoma in 2 patients, osteoblastoma in 2 patients, synovial sarcoma in 2 patients, Ewing's sarcoma in 1 patient, and simple bone cyst in 1 patient. Currettage and thermo- or chemocauterization was applied to 8 patients, a subtotal sacrectomy was done in 11 patients, and total sacrectomy and lumbopelvic stabilization was done in 3 patients. The surgical margins were wide in all patients with GCT. The surgical margins were wide in 3 patients and wide contaminated in 1 patient with chordoma. The 2 patients with chondrosarcoma had high sacral lesions and were managed with total sacrectomy and lumbopelvic fixation. The surgical margin was wide in 1 patient and wide contaminated in the other, who relapsed locally and systemically in the 30th postoperative month. Three patients with aggressive aneurysmal bone cyst and 1 patient with simple bone cyst were managed by curettage and thorough debridement. One patient with low sacral Ewing sarcoma was managed by subtotal sacrectomy with wide margins. The two osteoblastomas were localized to the posterior elements of the sacrum. None of the patients relapsed. Most of the tumors of the sacrum are benign aggressive lesions or low grade malignancies. Intralesional resections in the form of curettage, with the addition of chemo- or thermocauterization, provide a complete cure for benign lesions. In contrast, wide resections are necessary for complete disease control in radio- and chemoresistant malignancies. Nerve root dissection should be performed in order to achieve wide margins.</str>

      <str>We describe the outcomes and complications of 14 patients with paranasal sinus and anterior cranial fossa lesions surgically treated by an extended transbasal approach, originally described by Kawakami, in our department. They were 10 patients with malignant tumors, 2 with benign tumors, and 2 with inflammatory diseases. A bifrontal craniotomy was performed using a high coronal skin incision, and the orbital rim and roof were removed after the dissection of the dura mater from the anterior skull base. Transcranial resection of the tumor was performed, and assisted by transnasal and transmaxillar resection using a nasal endoscope. Reconstruction of the anterior skull base was performed with the fasica lata and galeopericranial flap in all cases, temporal musculo-pericranial flap in 3 and free bone flap from the cranial convex in 3. Among 10 patients with malignant tumors (malignant melanoma; 4, squamous cell carcinoma; 2 adenocarcinoma; 1, malignant plemorphic adenoma; 1, chondrosarcoma; 1, and neuroblastoma; 1), total removal was performed in 5 patients and subtotal removal in 5 patients. Though local recurrence of the tumor was recognized in 6 patients, only one underwent additional surgery. Eight patients survived, and 2 patients died of systemic metastasis of the tumor and complications due to liquorrhea. Seven patients obtained a good quality of life, and the mean survival period in 8 patients still living was 27 months after the first surgery. In 2 patients with benign tumors (chordoma and osteoma), partial and total removal was performed. The patient with chordoma was operated on several times by this approach and the transoral approach, respectively. Each had a good postoperative course.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>There has recently been interest in the use of high-dose radiation with methods such as radiosurgery and brachytherapy for skull base tumors. Brachytherapy is believed to be effective for clival chordomas, but technical difficulties exist in stereotactic insertion of catheters into the clivus. We assessed the usefulness following improvement of implantation techniques in three patients with clival chordomas. All tumors were larger than 50 mm in diameter. Removable iridium-192 sources were held in catheters which were implanted through a transnasal approach under general anesthesia using a CT-guided stereotactic system in one patient and a CRW stereotactic system adapted to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in 2 patients. The implantation array was designed based on results of stereotactic 3-D MRI scanning, and coordinates were calculated for stereotactic implantation through twist drill holes. These catheters were introduced through the nares and directed into the clival chordoma under endoscopic visualization and X-ray fluoroscopy. No complications such as CSF liquorrhea, hemorrhage or infection were observed. Brachytherapy with a total dose of 43.2-58.0 Gy at the tumor periphery was administered for 7 to 10 days, and serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated reduction in tumor size in two patients and no tumor growth in the other. Our results suggested that stereotactic brachytherapy is potentially useful for the control of clival chordomas and that computer-guided transnasal stereotactic insertion enables implantation of catheters less invasively and more accurately than does X-ray fluoroscopic guidance alone.</str>

      <str>The prognosis of aggressive benign and low-grade malignant tumors in the spine as in the limbs, seems to be mostly related to the feasibility of en bloc resection, while in the treatment of high-grade malignant tumors the protocols of treatment include the combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Indications, criteria of feasibility and surgical technique are extensively reported for the thoracic and lumbar spine. In the cervical spine few cases are reported of resection, due not only to anatomical constraint, but also to the rarity of finding a tumor accomplishing the criteria of feasibility. A case of double-approach vertebrectomy finalized to remove en bloc the body of C4 for a stage IA chordoma is reported. The first stage was posterior, aiming to remove the posterior healthy elements by piecemeal technique. The anterior approach consisted of contemporary right and left prevascular presternocleidomastoid approaches The specimen was submitted for the histological study of the margins, which resulted tumor-free. This technical note is finalized to confirm that en bloc resection of the vertebral body through total vertebrectomy is feasible in the midcervical spine by double approaches, provided the tumor involves only layers B and C, maximum extension sectors 5-8.</str>

      <str>Twelve patients with histologically confirmed clivus chordoma were treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1971 and 1989. Eight of the patients were men and four were women. The mean age at first operation was 51 years (range, 10 to 80). The most common presenting symptoms were headache, diplopia, dysphagia and dysarthria, and facial sensory changes. Computed tomography, with and without contrast enhancement, proved adequate for tumor identification and localization. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography were occasionally employed to localize the tumors further and to define tumor vascular supply and proximity to vascular structures. Twenty-two resections were performed in 11 patients, and another patient underwent biopsy only. Seven were also treated with radiation therapy. Tumors recurred in eight patients, six of whom underwent further operations. The mean time to first recurrence was 22 months (range 8 to 36 months). Six of the patients are still alive, with a mean follow-up of 31 months (range, 3 to 89 months) from first surgical resection. The mean survival time from first treatment was 31 months (range, 4 to 62 months) among those patients who died. There was no operative mortality. The 5-year cumulative survival rate was 20%. Six patients with long follow-up have had fair to good results, being free of recurrences for at least a year. However, none of the patients returned to their premorbid baseline of activities. Five of the patients had tumors with the histologic diagnosis of chondroid chordoma. Three of these patients are still alive. The mean age at first treatment was 44 (compared with 62 for typical chordomas). The mean time from symptoms to diagnosis was 29 months (typical chordomas, 18 months). The mean length of survival and time to tumor recurrence were not significantly different between chondroid and typical chordomas.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors that usually occur in adults. This report describes four cases of intracranial chordomas treated in patients 20 years of age or younger by the senior author (O.A.M.) during a 4-year period. The authors also reviewed the literature on pediatric patients, which revealed that the clinical presentations, histological patterns, and behaviors of these tumors differ considerably depending on whether the patient is younger or older than 5 years of age. The younger population had a wider range of presenting symptoms, a greater prevalence of atypical histological findings with aggressive behavior, a greater range of cellularity than the classic chordomas, and a higher instance of metastasis; it showed no chondroid component compared to a 17.1% instance in the older patients. The prognosis for patients with a chordoma is related directly to the histological pattern of the tumor; the atypical chordoma carries a poor prognosis. The prognoses for children older than 5 years of age with a classic or chondroid tumor were not significantly different (p=0.788). At follow up, the difference in survival rates between patients undergoing surgery plus radiation therapy and those who had surgery alone was statistically significant (p=0.00446). No correlation was found between radical resection or radiation therapy and an improved prognosis for patients younger than 5 years of age who had a tumor with an atypical histological pattern. This study identifies and delineates the distinction between these age groups and provides a review of the potential prognostic factors.</str>

Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants.

      <str>Malignant primary osseous spinal neoplasms are aggressive tumors that remain associated with poor outcomes despite aggressive multidisciplinary treatment measures. To date, prognosis for patients with these tumors is based on results from small single-center patient series and controlled trials. Large population-based observational studies are lacking. To assess national trends in histology-specific survival, the authors reviewed patient survival data spanning 30 years (1973-2003) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, a US population-based cancer registry.</str>
      <str>The SEER registry was queried to identify cases of histologically confirmed primary spinal chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma using coding from the International Classification of Disease for Oncology, Third Edition. Association of survival with histology, metastasis status, tumor site, and year of diagnosis was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis.</str>
      <str>A total of 1892 patients were identified with primary osseous spinal neoplasms (414 with chordomas, 579 with chondrosarcomas, 430 with osteosarcomas, and 469 with Ewing sarcomas). Chordomas presented in older patients (60 ± 17 years; p &lt; 0.01) whereas Ewing sarcoma presented in younger patients (19 ± 11 years; p &lt; 0.01) compared with patients with all other tumors. The relative incidence of each tumor type remained similar per decade from 1973 to 2003. African Americans comprised a significantly greater proportion of patients with osteosarcomas than other tumors (9.6% vs 3.5%, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). Compared with the sacrum, the mobile spine was more likely to be the site of tumor location for chordomas than for all other tumors (47% vs 23%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma were 3 times more likely than chondrosarcoma and chordoma to present with metastasis (31% vs 8%, respectively). Resection was performed more frequently for chordoma (88%) and chondrosarcoma (89%) than for osteosarcoma (61%) and Ewing sarcoma (53%). Overall median survival was histology-specific (osteosarcoma, 11 months; Ewing sarcoma, 26 months; chondrosarcoma, 37 months; chordoma, 50 months) and significantly worse in patients with metastasis at presentation for all tumor types. Survival did not significantly differ as a function of site (mobile spine vs sacrum/pelvis) for any tumor type, but more recent year of diagnosis was associated with improved survival for isolated spinal Ewing sarcoma (hazard ration [HR] 0.95; p = 0.001), chondrosarcoma (HR 0.98; p = 0.009), and chordoma (HR 0.98; p = 0.10), but not osteosarcoma.</str>
      <str>In this analysis of a 30-year, US population-based cancer registry (SEER), the authors provide nationally representative prognosis and survival data for patients with malignant primary spinal osseous neoplasms. Overall patient survival has improved for isolated spine tumors with advancements in care over the past 4 decades. These results may be helpful in providing historical controls for understanding the efficacy of new treatment paradigms, patient education, and guiding level of aggressiveness in treatment strategies.</str>

      <str>In Xenopus, the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway acting through beta-catenin functions both in establishing the dorso-ventral axis and in patterning the anterior-posterior axis. This pathway also acts in patterning the animal-vegetal axis in sea urchins. However, because sea urchin development is typically indirect, and adult sea urchins have pentamerous symmetry and lack a longitudinal nerve cord, it has not been clear how the roles of the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway in axial patterning in sea urchins and vertebrates are evolutionarily related. The developmental expression patterns of Notch, brachyury, caudal, and eight Wnt genes have now been determined for the invertebrate chordate Amphioxus, which, like sea urchins, has an early embryo that gastrulates by invagination, but like vertebrates, has a later embryo with a dorsal hollow nerve cord that elongates posteriorly from a tail bud. Comparisons of Amphioxus with other deuterostomes suggest that patterning of the ancestral deuterostome embryo along its anterior-posterior axis during the late blastula and subsequent stages involved a posterior signaling center including Wnts, Notch, and transcription factors such as brachyury and caudal. In tunicate embryos, in which cell numbers are reduced and cell fates largely determined during cleavage stages, only vestiges of this signaling center are still apparent; these include localization of Wnt-5 mRNA to the posterior cytoplasm shortly after fertilization and localization of beta-catenin to vegetal nuclei during cleavage stages. Neither in tunicates nor in Amphioxus is there any evidence that the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway functions in establishment of the dorso-ventral axis. Thus, roles for Wnt-signaling in dorso-ventral patterning of embryos may be a vertebrate innovation that arose in connection with the evolution of yolky eggs and gastrulation by extensive involution.</str>

      <str>Developmental transcription factors are key players in animal multicellularity, being members of the T-box family that are among the most important. Until recently, T-box transcription factors were thought to be exclusively present in metazoans. Here, we report the presence of T-box genes in several nonmetazoan lineages, including ichthyosporeans, filastereans, and fungi. Our data confirm that Brachyury is the most ancient member of the T-box family and establish that the T-box family diversified at the onset of Metazoa. Moreover, we demonstrate functional conservation of a homolog of Brachyury of the protist Capsaspora owczarzaki in Xenopus laevis. By comparing the molecular phenotype of C. owczarzaki Brachyury with that of homologs of early branching metazoans, we define a clear difference between unicellular holozoan and metazoan Brachyury homologs, suggesting that the specificity of Brachyury emerged at the origin of Metazoa. Experimental determination of the binding preferences of the C. owczarzaki Brachyury results in a similar motif to that of metazoan Brachyury and other T-box classes. This finding suggests that functional specificity between different T-box classes is likely achieved by interaction with alternative cofactors, as opposed to differences in binding specificity. </str>

      <str>Prospective analysis of local tumor control, survival and treatment complications in 67 consecutive patients treated with fractionated photon and proton radiation for chordoma or chondrosarcoma of the base of the skull and the cervical spine.</str>
      <str>Between December 1995 and January 2000, 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range: 14-85 years), were treated at the Centre de Protonthérapie d'Orsay (CPO), France, using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range: 60-70 CGE).</str>
      <str>Within a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 4-71 months), the 3-year local control rates were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates 88% and 75%, respectively. 14 tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical target volume [CTV], and two without further assessment). Seven patients died from their tumor and another one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and, similarly, the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age &lt; or = 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter &lt; 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV &lt; 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on local control. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control.</str>
      <str>In chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure. In two thirds of the cases, relapses are located in the GTV. Maximum diameter, GTV, and age are prognostic indicators of local control. These results should be confirmed during a longer follow-up.</str>

      <str>A retrospective study, analyzing midterm results of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for removal of a sacral chordoma.</str>
      <str>To develop a suitable method to maximally remove the tumor.</str>
      <str>Although previous reports have reported the use of TAE for removal of tumors, there is currently no data available on using this method to treat sacral chordomas.</str>
      <str>Thirty patients with sacral chordomas, who underwent surgical treatment from January 1994 to September 2005, were selected. All 30 patients underwent the posterior approach after TAE of the main arteries that supplied the sacral chordoma. The average follow-up was 44.6 months after the operation. The blood lost during the operation, blood transfusion, and the blood drained from the patient after the operation was reviewed. In addition, the sphincter muscle function of the bladder and bowel was observed.</str>
      <str>The intraoperative blood loss averaged 1200 mL during the removal of the tumor. The average blood drained from the patient after the operation was 650 mL. The average blood transfusion postoperatively was 1080 mL. Of the 30 patients, 12 had recurrence and 2 died of tumor metastasis. In the 17 patients whose sacral nerve roots had been bilaterally reserved at and above the S3 level, the sphincter muscle function of the bladder and bowel was good, whereas the function of the sphincter muscles was impaired in 2 patients with nerve roots reserved only at and above the S1 level. In 1 case, colostomy and ureterocutaneosomy were used.</str>
      <str>In comparison with historical literature, preoperative TAE for excising the sacral tumor can significantly decrease intraoperative blood loss, make the surgical field clear, possibly eliminate the need for using an anterior approach, and facilitate the maximal removal of the sacral chordoma. It is an encouraging technique for excising the sacral chordomas.</str>

      <str>Although FGF signaling plays an integral role in the migration and patterning of mesoderm at gastrulation, the mechanism and downstream targets of FGF activity have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that FGFR1 orchestrates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and morphogenesis of mesoderm at the primitive streak by controlling Snail and E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, we show that FGFR1 functions in mesoderm cell fate specification by positively regulating Brachyury and Tbx6 expression. Finally, we provide evidence that the attenuation of Wnt3a signaling observed in Fgfr1 -/- embryos can be rescued by lowering E-cadherin levels. We propose that modulation of cytoplasmic beta-catenin levels, associated with FGF-induced downregulation of E-cadherin, provides a molecular link between FGF and Wnt signaling pathways at the streak.</str>

      <str>The vertebrate Fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. Two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, Fgf8a and Fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with Fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for Fgf receptors. To investigate the in vivo requirement for Fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing Fgf8b expression in mice. Analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of Fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. We show that the loss of Fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Importantly, Fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as Fgf8b-deficient embryos at E6.5, demonstrating that signaling by Fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. By contrast, during gastrulation, Fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of Fgf8b in mesoderm specification. We show that an increased level of Fgf8a expression, which leads to Fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of Fgf8b. Therefore, different Fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. Importantly, our findings implicate Fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.</str>

      <str>Xmi-er1 is an immediate-early gene encoding a transcriptional regulator whose expression is activated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) during mesoderm induction in Xenopus. In this study, we examined the role of xmi-er1 in embryonic development and mesoderm induction and investigated the importance of various functional domains in the protein sequence. Overexpression of xmi-er1 in embryos resulted in truncations of the anteroposterior axis, with most of the abnormal embryos exhibiting deficiencies in both anterior and posterior structures. Whole mount in situ hybridization for the early mesodermal marker brachyury (Xbra) revealed a dramatic reduction of Xbra expression in xmi-er1-injected embryos, while mesoderm induction assays showed that overexpression of xmi-er1 significantly reduced the percentage of explants induced by FGF-2. Site-directed mutagenesis of several functional domains, including the ELM2 domain, the SANT domain, a putative MEK phosphorylation site, and a proline-rich region showed that only proline 365 in the proline-rich region is required for the effect on embryonic development and mesoderm induction. These data demonstrate that XMI-ER1 is a negative regulator of FGF, perhaps serving to limit the extent of mesoderm formation in vivo, and that this activity is mediated by proline 365.</str>

      <str>The involution of presumptive mesoderm that occurs during amphibian gastrulation is a complex process requiring the coordinated action of a diverse range of cells. We show that cells with distinct morphologies, resembling each of those normally found in the involuting tissue of the Xenopus embryo, are induced in dispersed animal pole cells by different doses of the potent mesoderm-inducing factor activin. Each cell type is induced within a restricted dose range of activin concentrations, the boundaries of which are well demarcated shortly after activin treatment. In contrast, Brachyury and goosecoid, two genes thought to pattern the presumptive mesoderm, and the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, which is expressed in the mesoderm of gastrula stage embryos, are induced by broad, overlapping ranges of high activin concentrations at such early times. Similarly, the response of the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor A, which is expressed normally in ectoderm of gastrula stage embryos, diminishes gradually as the activin concentration increases. Dose windows for the expression of these four genes narrow and become distinct from one another in cell aggregates after several hours in culture, suggesting that activin prompts a dynamic program of gene expression in induced mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Tetrapod fore-and hindlimbs have evolved from the pectoral and pelvic fins of an ancient vertebrate ancestor. In this ancestor, the pectoral fin appears to have arisen following the rostral homeotic recapitulation of an existing pelvic appendage (Tabin and Laufer (1993), Nature 361, 692-693). Thus the basic appendage outgrowth program is reiterated in both tetrapod fore- and hindlimbs and the pectoral and pelvic fins of extant teleost fishes (Sordino et al. (1995) Nature 375, 678-681). Recently a novel family of putative transcription factors, which includes the T (Brachyury) locus, has been identified and dubbed the "T-box' family. In mice, all of these genes have expression patterns indicative of involvement in embryonic induction (Chapman et al. (1996) Dev. Dyn., in press), and four (Tbx2-Tbx5) are represented as two cognate, linked gene pairs (Agulnik et al., (1996), Genetics, in press). We now report that, whereas Tbx2 and Tbx3 are expressed in similar spatiotemporal patterns in both limbs, Tbx5 and Tbx4 expression is primarily restricted to the developing fore- and hindlimb buds, respectively. These observations suggest that T-box genes have played a role in the evolution of fin and limb morphogenesis, and that Tbx5 and Tbx4 may have been divergently selected to play a role in the differential specification of fore- (pectoral) versus hind- (pelvic) limb (fin) identity.</str>

      <str>Differentiation of the principal body axes in the early vertebrate embryo is based on a specific blueprint of gene expression and a series of transient axial structures such as Hensen's node and the notochord of the late gastrulation phase. Prior to gastrulation, the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) of the mouse egg-cylinder or the anterior marginal crescent (AMC) of the rabbit embryonic disc marks the anterior pole of the embryo. For phylogenetic and functional reasons both these entities are addressed here as the mammalian anterior pregastrulation differentiation (APD). However, mouse and rabbit show distinct structural differences in APD and the molecular blueprint, making the search of general rules for axial differentiation in mammals difficult. Therefore, the pig was analysed here as a further species with a mammotypical flat embryonic disc. Using light and electron microscopy and in situ hybridisation for three key genes involved in early development (sox17, nodal and brachyury), two axial structures of early gastrulation in the pig were identified: (1) the anterior hypoblast (AHB) characterised by increased cellular height and density and by sox17 expression, and (2) the early primitive streak characterised by a high pseudostratified epithelium with an almost continuous but unusually thick basement membrane, by localised epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and by brachyury expression in the epiblast. The stepwise appearance of these two axial structures was used to define three stages typical for mammals at the start of gastrulation. Intriguingly, the round shape and gradual posterior displacement of the APD in the pig appear to be species-specific (differing from all other mammals studied in detail to date) but correlate with ensuing specific primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm development. APD and, hence, the earliest axial structure presently known in the mammalian embryo may thus be functionally involved in shaping extraembryonic membranes and, possibly, the specific adult body form.</str>

      <str>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a mandatory coreceptor for many growth factors and morphogens involved in embryonic development; its bioactivity is dictated by complex sulfation motifs embedded within the polymer chain. Using a panel of HS-specific antibodies we have identified a unique HS epitope recognized by antibody HS4C3 that is selectively expressed during differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells along the mesodermal lineage to the hemangioblast stage. The appearance of this high-affinity HS4C3-binding (HS4C3(high)) epitope is transient; the epitope is specifically expressed within the emerging Brachyury(+) (Bry(+)) population and marks those cells that will become fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk1)(+). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separation and colony forming assays revealed that HS4C3(high)/Flk1(+) cells have a dramatically increased potential to form both blast and endothelial colonies, both of which depend upon the HS-binding growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor. Critically, expression of this HS epitope is tightly regulated, disappearing from the cell surface as the resultant hematopoietic lineages mature, in a similar manner to protein markers Bry and Flk1. In vivo studies showed a remarkable correlation with in vitro findings, with expression of HS4C3-binding epitopes restricted to newly formed mesodermal tissues during gastrulation. We believe this is the first time a defined HS epitope has been implicated in a specific developmental pathway and that this provides, in addition, a novel enrichment technique for the isolation of hemangioblasts from mixed differentiated ES cell cultures.</str>

      <str>The study investigated 14 pathological specimens of cranial base chordomas from patients who were monitored for at least 2 years after their initial operations. Some cases involved multiple tumor recurrences and multiple operations. For those patients, the time to recurrence after each operation was recorded and a mean value was calculated. Nine patients with mean times to recurrence of 24 months or more or with 24 months of follow-up monitoring without recurrence after single operations were designated the "good-prognosis" group. Five patients with mean times to recurrence of less than 24 months were designated the "poor-prognosis" group. In each case, only the specimen from the initial operation was studied. Multiple sequential sections were cut from paraffin-embedded blocks of tissue and immunohistochemically prepared for detection of three growth factors and three structural proteins, i.e., basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibronectin, collagen III, and collagen IV. Intensity of expression was graded by using a four-tier system (Grades 0, 1, 2, and 3). Levels of expression of the molecules in the two groups were evaluated and compared.</str>
      <str>The mean transforming growth factor alpha expression intensity grades for the good- and poor-prognosis groups were 0.8 and 2.6, respectively, and the corresponding mean basic fibroblast growth factor grades were 1.4 and 2.6.

The authors report the first case of a chordoid meningioma in the third ventricle. A 12-year-old boy presented with headache, abnormal behaviors, and ataxia. Brain MR imaging revealed a 2-cm, well-enhanced mass in the third ventricle and hydrocephalus. Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose showed that the mass was hypermetabolic. Gross-total removal of the mass was performed using a left frontal transcortical and transventricular approach. The mass originated from the left caudate head and was connected to the choroid plexus. A chordoid meningioma was diagnosed on the basis of the histological characteristics of the tumor, which was composed of cords and nests of eosinophilic vacuolated cells with an abundant myxoid matrix, similar to the features of a chordoma. A typical focal meningiomatous pattern was observed. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen. The patient's headache and gait disturbance improved after the tumor was removed. The tumor showed no signs of recurrence during 12 months of follow-up.</str>

      <str>Primary spinal tumors are rare diseases. Primary spinal tumor registry would be useful to help decision making in this complex field of spine surgery. In this article the authors present the latest findings from the Primary Spinal Tumor Registry at the National Centre for Spinal Disorders, Hungary. The registry is based on a novel database management software, the REDCap electronic data capture system. It contains data of 323 patients treated surgically during an 18-year period. Among the 126 malignant tumors, the most frequent was chordoma (61 cases). In the case of benign tumors schwannoma showed the largest prevalence (45 cases). The authors conclude that due to the rarity of the disease and the complexity of the management, multicenter, prospective registries are required to provide high level of evidence. The structure of the Primary Spinal Tumor Registry in the National Centre for Spinal Disorders in Hungary is optimal for user-friendly, fast and secure data collection providing a prospective database for scientific researches and clinical follow-up.</str>

      <str>The best treatment of sacral chordoma is surgical resection, nowadays associated with optimized radiation therapy. We analysed 1) the oncologic outcome in a large series; 2) the effect of previous intralesional surgery, resection level, tumor volume and margins on survivorship to local recurrence (LR) and 3) the complication rate.</str>
      <str>We reviewed 71 patients with sacral chordomas. Forty-eight resections were proximal to S3. Mean tumor volume was 535 cm3. Eleven received previous intralesional surgery elsewhere. Margins were wide in 44 resections, wide-contaminated in 11, marginal in 9 and intralesional in 7.</str>
      <str>Overall survival was 92%, 65% and 44% at 5, 10 and 15 years. At a mean of 9.5 years 37 were NED (54.4%), 23 died with disease (33.8%) and 8 were alive with disease (11.7%). Relapses included 15 LRs, 6 distant metastases, 17 both. LR rate was significantly higher in patients with previous surgery (p=0.0217), with inadequate margins (p= 0.0339) and large tumors(p&lt;0.01), whereas resection level was not significant. Multivariate analysis confirmed the role of tumor volume. Complication rate was high (80.9%) with an infection rate of 41.2%.</str>
      <str>The most prominent adverse factor for LR was previous intralesional surgery. LR rate was related with inadequate margins and tumor volume. J. Surg. Oncol. 2015; 112:344-351. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</str>

      <str>To report 2 rare cases of benign notochordal cell tumor (BNCT), according to WHO classification of tumors of soft tissue and bone (4th edition). Their radiologic and clincopathologic features and differential diagnosis were investigated.</str>
      <str>Two cases of BNCT were studied by retrospective review of the clinical, radiologic, pathologic and immunophenotypical findings. Related literatures were reviewed at the same time.</str>
      <str>Case 1 was a 53-year-old man, and case 2 was a 61-year-old woman. Radiographically, both patients presented with abnormal imaging findings in the fifth cervical vertebral body with the lesions located within the bone but without extra osseous mass. Histopathologically, the lesions lacked lobular architecture and extracellular myxoid matrix. The tumor cells were vacuolated and had centrally or peripherally placed round or oval nuclei with small nucleoli, mimicking mature adipocytes. No cytological atypia or mitotic figures were seen. The affected bone trabeculae were sclerotic and islands of bone marrow were often entrapped within the tumor.</str>
      <str>Although sharing similar anatomic distribution and immunophenotype to those of chordoma, BNCT has distinct radiologic and pathologic features and different treatment and prognosis. The differential diagnosis between BNCT and chordoma requires detailed clinical, radiologic and histopathologic evaluations.</str>

      <str>Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is a rare entity. The present case is the first report of mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the large bowel. A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital to undergo surgery for a recurrent chordoma of the hip. A barium enema and colonoscopy were carried out to assess whether there was any relationship between the recurrent chordoma and the rectum. An ulcerating tumor was thus identified in the ascending colon. A radical right hemicolectomy was carried out. In the resected specimen a 3-cm ulcerating lesion was observed. The tumor consisted of PAS-positive mucin-producing cells, epidermoid cells, and intermediate cells. No differentiated squamous cell carcinoma cells were identified in any part of the tumor. The malignant cells proliferated mainly in the submucosa but also invaded the muscularis and serosa. The tumor was diagnosed as a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the ascending colon. Unfortunately, despite chemotherapy, the patient developed liver metastases and died of liver failure 10 months postoperatively.</str>

      <str>Parachordoma is a very rare peripheral soft tissue tumor of unknown lineage, which has been described under other names, all of which imply a similarity to chordoma. It forms a circumscribed firm tumor, usually in deep soft tissue, with a variety of histologic patterns and cytologic features, including cords and nests of cells, some of which are vacuolated. The ultrastructure and immunophenotype indicate epithelial differentiation and parachordomas are additionally S-100 protein positive. This tumor is distinct from extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and probably from soft tissue myoepithelioma. While histologically it somewhat resembles chordoma, parachordoma has a wider range of appearances, and the two neoplasms differ in their detailed cytokeratin immunophenotype and their clinical behavior. Parachordoma is a slowly growing tumor with occasional late recurrence; cases with reported metastasis have not been histologically convincing. This commentary discusses the terminology, origin, and possible nature of this enigmatic neoplasm.</str>

      <str>A combined anterior and posterior approach was used for the resection of a large tumor (a chordoma, a giant-cell tumor, an osteosarcoma, or a chondrosarcoma) of the cephalad part of the sacrum in twelve patients. The anterior aspect of the sacrum was exposed through an extended ilioinguinal approach, and the posterior aspect, through a midline approach. This widely extensile procedure permitted simultaneous visualization of the anterior, posterior, and circumferential aspects of the sacrum at the time of the osteotomy and facilitated the resection of these difficult lesions. At the time of follow-up (average duration for the eleven surviving patients, thirty-seven months; median, thirty months; range, twenty to sixty-nine months), ten patients were able to walk independently (four with the use of a cane) and one was confined to a wheelchair. One patient had died immediately postoperatively. The results of the present study indicate that a combined extended ilioinguinal and posterior approach can be used effectively for the wide resection of a tumor arising in the cephalad part of the sacrum.</str>

      <str>A 17-year-old female, who had diplopia and progressive gait disturbance, had been diagnosed as having a right parasellar mass lesion in 1986. Initial CT scan failed to show a parasellar space occupying lesion, although it was well demonstrated on MRI. No surgery was carried out at that time. Seven years later, she was hospitalized because of progressive gait disturbance, lower cranial nerves palsy, and cerebellar sign as well as the known right abducence palsy. At this time, CT scan exhibited a huge low density area with a marginal high density area suggesting calcification, which extended from the right parasellar area to the ventral portion of the midbrain. She underwent surgery under the diagnosis of cartilaginous tumor or chordoma. The intracranial lesion was removed via combined translabyrinthine approach and epidural subtemporal approach. The tumor was hitologically diagnosed as well-differentiated chondrosarcoma. Electron-microscopy demonstrated tumor cells with features of chondrocytes. Since the original site of the tumor, strategies for treatment and prognosis are different from each other, distinction between chondrosarcoma and chordoma is important. MRI seemed very useful for making this distinction as a first step.</str>

      <str>The differentiation and maintenance of a neurotransmitter phenotype is guided by the interaction of exogenous cues with intrinsic genetic machinery. For the noradrenergic phenotype, these influences combine to activate the expression of the catecholaminergic biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). In this study, we evaluate the molecular mechanisms by which the transcription factor Arix/Phox2a contributes to DBH gene transcription. We have evaluated the contribution of individual homeodomain binding sites in the rat DBH promoter region and find that all are essential for both basal and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulated transcription. Using mammalian one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, we demonstrate that recruitment of Arix to the positions of homeodomain core recognition sites 1 and 2 at -153 to -166 of the DBH gene restores complete responsiveness of the promoter to PKA in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma and HepG2 hepatoma cells. Intracellular Arix-Arix interactions are evident and may contribute to the interdependence of homeodomain binding sites. Analysis of functional domains of Arix reveals an N-terminal activation domain and a C-terminal repression domain. The N terminus of Arix contains an amino acid motif similar to a region in Brachyury and Pax9 transcription factors. The N-terminal activation domain of Arix interacts with the transcriptional co-activator, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein, which potentiates transcription from the DBH promoter in a PKA-dependent manner. The present study supports the hypothesis that the paired-like homeodomain protein, Arix, acts as a critical phenotype-specific regulator of the DBH promoter by serving as an integrator of signal-dependent transcription activators within the network of the general transcription machinery.</str>

      <str>This study analyzed the spatial and temporal expression pattern of zebrafish wnt11 and the regulation of the expression during zebrafish early development, focusing on the interaction with the no tail (ntl) gene, a zebrafish orthologue of mouse Brachyury (T). Zygotic expression of wnt11 was first detected at the late blastula stage in the blastoderm margin, a presumptive mesoderm region. wnt11 expression coincided with mesoderm induction, and the expression was induced by mesoderm inducers such as the yolk cell (Mizuno, T., Yamaha, E., Wakahara, M., Kuroiwa, A., Takeda, H., 1996. Mesoderm induction in zebrafish. Nature 383, 131-132) or FGFs, indicating that, like ntl, wnt11 is one of the immediate-early genes in mesoderm induction. Initial expression domains of wnt11 and ntl overlapped, and these genes showed a similar response to mesoderm inducers. However, analysis of the ntl mutant embryos suggested that wnt11 and ntl are placed in distinct genetic pathways; the ntl mutation had no effect on wnt11 expression in the blastoderm margin. This was further supported by the result of RNA injection experiments showing that overexpression of Wnt11 did not affect ntl expression in the margin. Thus, wnt11 and ntl expression are induced and maintained independently in their initial phase of expression. In later stages, wnt11 was expressed in various organs, such as the somites, particularly in the developing notochord. Since no wnt gene has been reported to be expressed in the axial mesoderm, which is known to act as a signaling source that patterns the neural tube and somites, zebrafish wnt11 is the first wnt gene expressed in the notochord. Furthermore, in contrast to early expression, wnt11 expression in the notochord depended on Ntl activity. In the ntl mutant in which somite patterning is severely affected, wnt11 expression was completely lost, while another signaling molecule, sonic hedgehog is expressed in the mutant notochord precursor cells (Krauss, S., Concordet, J.-P., Ingham, P.W., 1993. A functionally conserved homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene hh is expressed in tissues with polarizing activity in zebrafish embryos. Cell 75, 1431-1444). wnt11 expression in the somite also shows a characteristic pattern, correlated with the migration and differentiation of slow muscle precursors. These observations suggest a role for wnt11 in patterning the somites.</str>

      <str>Neural tube defects (NTD) together with cardiovascular system defects are the most common malformations in the Polish population (2.05-2.68/1000 newborns). They arise during early embryogenesis and are caused by an improper neural groove closure during the neurulation process. NTD can arise from the influence of specific environmental factors on the foetus. The genetic factor is also very important, because NTDs have multigenetic conditioning. It was suggested that genes connected with the regulation of neurulation could also be involved in NTD aetiology, especially when their deletion or modification leads to neural tube defects in the mouse model. Examples are genes from the PAX family, T (Brachyury), BRCA1 and PDGFRA genes.</str>

In their report of several marker genes that distinguish nucleus pulposus cells from other related cell types, the authors provide novel insights into the notochordal nature of the former. Together with recently published work, their work lends support to the view that all cells present within the nucleus pulposus are derived from the notochord. Hence, the choice of an animal model for disc research should be based on considerations other than the cell loss and replacement by non-notochordal cells.</str>

      <str>Animal development relies on complex programs of gene regulation that are likely to account for a significant fraction of the information carried in genomes. The evolution of these regulatory programs is a major contributor to the diversity of animal forms, yet the architecture of the transcriptional networks that comprise developmental programs is only beginning to come into focus. The sea urchin offers an uncomplicated system in which to study transcriptional regulation and the networks that direct embryogenesis. This review describes the approaches that we are taking towards this problem using the sea urchin embryo and some comparative methods that will eventually lead to a deeper understanding of the evolution of developmental networks.</str>

      <str>Evidence is presented for the existence of two strong murine teratocarcinoma transplantation antigens (Gt) on the cell line PCC3. It is shown that the loci governing expression of these antigens are linked to the H-2 complex. These loci have been further mapped with respect to the brachyury marker (T) and H-2: Gt-1 lies 5 +/- 2 crossover units proximal to H-2 and 12 +/- 2 crossover units distal to T; Gt-2 lies 21 +/- 4 crossover units distal to H-2. It is possible that these strong transplantation antigens provide an embryonic analogue to the adult major histocompatibility system.</str>

      <str>The efficacy of the anterolateral approach to the nasopharynx and its vicinity was evaluated. Using this maxillary swing approach, we have removed tumors in and around the nasopharyngeal region in 26 patients. Among them, 18 suffered from recurrent primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma after external radiotherapy, three patients had chordoma, two had schwannoma, one had adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx, and one had malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The last patient had a recurrent deep-lobe parotid gland tumor localized in the paranasopharyngeal space. The facial wounds in all 26 patients healed primarily with no evidence of necrosis of the maxilla. Seven patients developed palatal fistula, five of them subsequently healed, whereas one patient required surgical closure and one had to wear a dental plate. This group of patients was followed up from 4 to 42 months (median, 15 months). Among the 18 patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma, five had local recurrence, four died of other conditions, and nine of them are still alive with no evidence of disease. This gives an actuarial control of tumor in the nasopharynx of 42% at 3.5 years. In the eight patients remaining, one died of recurrent chordoma, two are alive with recurrent disease, and five are free of disease. Exposure of the nasopharynx and the paranasopharyngeal space is possible using the anterolateral approach. The associated morbidity is low.</str>

      <str>Between 1997 and 2007, 394 patients were treated with carbon ion RT at Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany. Of these patients, 17 patients were aged&lt;or=21 years. Seventeen of these young patients were treated for chordoma or low-grade chondrosarcoma of the skull base and were analyzed in this study. Irradiation was performed after primary diagnosis in 14 patients (82%) and for recurrent tumors in 3 patients (18%). The authors applied a median total dose of 60 gray equivalents (Gy E) (range, 60-66.6 Gy E) in a fractionation of 7x3 Gy E per week of carbon ion RT using the raster scan technique. All patients were observed prospectively on a regular basis after carbon ion RT.</str>
      <str>The median follow-up time was 49 months. Treatment was well tolerated without severe side effects and could be completed on an outpatient basis in all patients without interruptions.

      <str>Nasal endoscope has been used increasingly during skull base surgery. However, most of endoscopic surgery limited to the repair of cerebrospinal rhinorrhea, decompression of traumatic optic nerve, hypophysectomy, etc. This study was undertaken to determine whether endoscopic endonasal approach was safe and effective for the resection of tumors located in petroclival region and infratemporal fossa.</str>
      <str>Seventeen patients with tumors of petroclival region and infratemporal fossa treated by endoscopic endonasal surgery between January 2002 and February 2005 were studied prospectively. The operative technique was described in detail. There were 5 chordoma, 1 esthesioneuroblastoma, 1 chondrosarcoma, 1 lymphoma, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 hemangioblastoma, 4 meningioma, 1 schwannoma, and 2 metastatic carcinoma. 3 patients were selected for neuronavigation-aided endoscopic endonasal surgery.</str>
      <str>Total tumor removal was obtained in 15 cases, subtotal removal in 2 case. With follow-up of 5 to 43 months, 1 case with chordoma was recurrent 5 months later postoperatively and underwent reoperation subsequently. The other cases with benign tumors were no recurrence. All of 5 cases with malignant tumors followed up for longer than 2 years were no recurrence and death.

      <str>Chordoma is a distinctly uncommon neoplasm in the first two decades of life. To characterize further its clinicopathologic features in this age group, we studied 12 chordomas from six males and six females (age range, 1 month to 20 years at diagnosis), with a mean age of 6 years. Six tumors arose in the clivus, four in the cervical or thoracic vertebrae, and two in the lumbar and sacrococcygeal areas. The clinical presentations reflected the location. Histologically, six cases were classic chordomas; the remaining six had atypical or nonclassic features of a round cell or spindle cell tumor. Immunohistochemical stains for vimentin and cytokeratin were positive in all cases tested, whereas epithelial membrane antigen was detected in 11 examples, and S100 protein reactivity was noted in nine lesions. The tumors were uniformly nonreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and carcinoembryonic antigen. Electron microscopy in six cases demonstrated large primitive cells with attenuated cell junctions, whorls of cytoplasmic filaments, vacuoles, and glycogen aggregates. Ten children had died of tumor at intervals of 3 weeks to 4.5 years after diagnosis and treatment. Lung, lymph nodes, and other organs were the distant metastatic sites in seven cases. These findings imply that chordomas in children are more variable histologically and may pursue a more aggressive clinical course than their adult counterpart. Immunohistochemical studies are particularly helpful in the differentiation of atypical chordomas from other round and spindle cell neoplasms.</str>

      <str>Patients with chordoma (n = 416) and chondrosarcoma (n = 269) within the skull base from 1983 to 2009 were identified within the SEER database. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to test associations with survival. t tests and χ(2) tests were used to compare groups.</str>
      <str>Chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients were similar demographically. Survival at 5 years was 65% for chordomas and 81.8% (P &lt; 0.0001) for chondrosarcomas and at 10 years was 32.3% and 49.5% (P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis demonstrated chordomas had a worse prognosis even when we controlled for age and tumor size (hazard ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9-4.7, P &lt; 0.0001). For chordomas, multivariate analysis demonstrated increasing age and tumor size were significantly associated with reduced survival. For chondrosarcomas, multivariate analysis demonstrated older age, earlier decade of diagnosis, and mesenchymal subtype were significantly associated with reduced survival. Postoperative radiation was given to 42% and 41% of patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively. The addition of radiation did not improve survival.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and hold great promise as models for human development and disease studies, cell-replacement therapies, drug discovery and in vitro cytotoxicity tests. The culture and differentiation of these cells are both complex and expensive, so it is essential to extreme aseptic conditions. hESCs are susceptible to Mycoplasma sp. infection, which is hard to detect and alters stem cell-associated properties. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficacy and cytotoxic effect of Plasmocin(TM) and ciprofloxacin (specific antibiotics used for Mycoplasma sp. eradication) on hESCs. Mycoplasma sp. infected HUES-5 884 (H5 884, stable hESCs H5-brachyury promoter-GFP line) cells were effectively cured with a 14 days Plasmocin(TM) 25 µg/ml treatment (curative treatment) while maintaining stemness characteristic features. Furthermore, cured H5 884 cells exhibit the same karyotype as the parental H5 line and expressed GFP, through up-regulation of brachyury promoter, at day 4 of differentiation onset. Moreover, H5 cells treated with ciprofloxacin 10 µg/ml for 14 days (mimic of curative treatment) and H5 and WA09 (H9) hESCs treated with Plasmocin(TM) 5 µg/ml (prophylactic treatment) for 5 passages retained hESCs features, as judged by the expression of stemness-related genes (TRA1-60, TRA1-81, SSEA-4, Oct-4, Nanog) at mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the presence of specific markers of the three germ layers (brachyury, Nkx2.5 and cTnT: mesoderm; AFP: endoderm; nestin and Pax-6: ectoderm) was verified in in vitro differentiated antibiotic-treated hESCs. In conclusion, we found that Plasmocin(TM) and ciprofloxacin do not affect hESCs stemness and pluripotency nor cell viability. However, curative treatments slightly diminished cell growth rate. This cytotoxic effect was reversible as cells regained normal growth rate upon antibiotic withdrawal. </str>

      <str>The kidney is formed from two tissue populations derived from the intermediate mesoderm, the ureteric bud, and the metanephric mesenchyme. Metanephric mesenchyme is a pluripotent renal stem population, and conversion of renal mesenchyme into epithelia depends on the ureteric bud in vivo and in vitro. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been induced to differentiate into a broad spectrum of specialized cell types in vitro, including hematopoietic, pancreatic, and neuronal cells. Such ES-derived cells can provide a valuable source of progenitor cells. However, whether ES cells can be stimulated by factors secreted from the fetal renal cells to differentiate into renal precursor cells in vitro has not been reported. In this study, we showed that murine ES cells can give rise to embryoid bodies in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. Culture conditions were optimized [6 days, 10 ng/ml activin and 10(-7) M retinoic acid (RA)] to generate maximal mesoderm populations specifically expressing Pax2 and brachyury. Results showed that 72% of the cells were brachyury positive by fluorescent activated cell sorter on Day 6 of EB cell differentiation. Conditioned medium collected from cultures of ureteric bud cells from renal cells of a 13-day-old fetus was added to the culture medium. Mesoderm cells were cultured for up to 10 days before showing expression of renal markers, initiation of nephrogenesis (WT-1 and Pax2), and terminally differentiated renal cell types (POD-1 and E-cadherin). This study suggests that ES cells pre-treated by RA and activin can interact with secreted molecules of the fetal renal cells to specifically differentiate into renal precursor cells. Our results provide an experimental basis for the development of in vitro assays to steer differentiation of ES cells toward renal lineages.</str>

      <str>Two hundred and two benign and malignant soft tissue lesions were studied for the presence of S-100 protein by means of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Virtually all benign nerve sheath tumors (neurofibroma, neurilemoma, and granular cell tumor) contained numerous immunoreactive S-100-positive cells. Only one-half (18 of 36) of malignant schwannomas contained the protein, suggesting that its presence is an expression of differentiation in Schwann cell tumors. S-100 protein was not identified within pure neuroblastic tumors (neuroblastoma, neuroepithelioma) but could be identified within rare cells of the ganglioneuroblastoma and within the Schwann cell component of ganglioneuroma. It was also identified within most melanocytic tumors (cellular blue nevus, clear cell sarcoma, and melanoma). In fact, its constant presence in melanoma indicates that it may prove to be an independently reliable method for diagnosing amelanotic forms. It is also sporadically present within a variety of mesenchymal lesions including lipoma, liposarcoma, synovial chondromatosis, chondrosarcoma, fibromatosis, histiocytosis X, and chordoma. Although S-100 protein is highly characteristic of neural crest-derived tumors, it is not restricted to them and, consequently, must be interpreted cautiously. It may prove helpful in select situations such as the distinction of (a) benign nerve sheath tumors from other benign mesenchymal tumors such as fibrous histiocytomas, (b) cellular neurilemomas from malignant schwannomas, (c) malignant schwannomas from conventional fibrosarcoma (d) malignant melanomas from many carcinomas, and, possibly (e) juvenile xanthogranulomas from histiocytosis X.</str>

(2) Mis- and/or overexpression of (beta)-catenin induced the development of an endoderm-specific alkaline phosphatase (AP) in presumptive notochord cells and epidermis cells without affecting differentiation of primary lineage muscle cells. (3) Downregulation of (beta)-catenin induced by the overexpression of cadherin resulted in the suppression of endoderm cell differentiation. This suppression was compensated for by the differentiation of extra epidermis cells. (4) Specification of notochord cells did not take place in the absence of endoderm differentiation. Both the overexpression of (beta)-catenin in presumptive notochord cells and the downregulation of (beta)-catenin in presumptive endoderm cells led to the suppression of Brachyury gene expression, resulting in the failure of notochord specification. These results suggest that the accumulation of (beta)-catenin in the nuclei of endoderm progenitor cells is the first step in the process of ascidian endoderm specification.</str>

      <str>Inhibition of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling prevents trunk and tail formation in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos. While the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (called No Tail in zebrafish) is a key mediator of FGF signaling in the notochord and tail, the pathways activated by FGF in non-notochordal trunk mesoderm have been uncertain. Previous studies have shown that the spadetail gene is required for non-notochordal trunk mesoderm formation; spadetail mutant embryos have major trunk mesoderm deficiencies, but relatively normal tail and notochord development. We demonstrate here that spadetail encodes a T-box transcription factor with homologues in Xenopus and chick. Spadetail is likely to be a key mediator of FGF signaling in trunk non-notochordal mesoderm, since spadetail expression is regulated by FGF signaling. Trunk and tail development are therefore dependent upon the complementary actions of two T-box genes, spadetail and no tail. We show that the regulatory hierarchy among spadetail, no tail and a third T-box gene, tbx6, are substantially different during trunk and tail mesoderm formation, and propose a genetic model that accounts for the regional phenotypes of spadetail and no tail mutants.</str>

      <str>Our ability to guide differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) toward desired lineages efficiently and reproducibly in xeno-free conditions is the key to advancing hPSC technology from the laboratory to clinical use. Here we report an engineered biomimetic substrate functionalized with both peptide ligands for α5β1 and α6β1 integrins to support efficient early mesodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) when cultured in a differentiation medium containing BMP4. In contrast, mesodermal differentiation is not induced on substrates functionalized with either ligand alone even though the culture medium is identical. Mesodermal differentiation was characterized by immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometric analysis, and RT-PCR analysis of early mesodermal markers Brachyury, Mixl1, and Wnt3. The early mesodermal progenitors derived on the substrate functionalized with both integrin ligands have the normal developmental potential to further differentiate along the hemato-endothelial and cardiac lineages. Immobilized ligands for α5β1 and α6β1 integrins both are permissive, necessary, and sufficient insoluble ligands in this engineered system to support early mesodermal differentiation of hESCs. This synthetic substrate, in conjunction with defined soluble factors, constructs a well-controlled and xeno-free early mesodermal differentiation niche that offers advantages over the previously reported niche constructed with the Matrigel-coated substrate.</str>

      <str>Neural induction is widely believed to be a direct consequence of inhibition of BMP pathways. Because of conflicting results and interpretations, we have re-examined this issue in Xenopus and chick embryos using the powerful and general TGFbeta inhibitor, Smad7, which inhibits both Smad1- (BMP) and Smad2- (Nodal/Activin) mediated pathways. We confirm that Smad7 efficiently inhibits phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad2. Surprisingly, however, over-expression of Smad7 in Xenopus ventral epidermis induces expression of the dorsal mesodermal markers Chordin and Brachyury. Neural markers are induced, but in a non-cell-autonomous manner and only when Chordin and Brachyury are also induced. Simultaneous inhibition of Smad1 and Smad2 by different approaches does not account for all Smad7 effects, indicating that Smad7 has activities other than inhibition of the TGFbeta pathway. We provide evidence that these effects are independent of Wnt, FGF, Hedgehog and retinoid signalling. We also show that these effects are due to elements outside of the MH2 domain of Smad7. Together, these results indicate that BMP inhibition is not sufficient for neural induction even when Nodal/Activin is also blocked, and that Smad7 activity is considerably more complex than had previously been assumed. We suggest that experiments relying on Smad7 as an inhibitor of TGFbeta-pathways should be interpreted with considerable caution.</str>

      <str>Mechanisms that regulate the number of cells constituting the body have remained largely elusive. We approached this issue in the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, which develops into a tadpole larva with a small number of cells. The embryonic cells divide 11 times on average from fertilization to hatching. The number of cell division rounds varies among tissue types. For example, notochord cells divide 9 times and give rise to large postmitotic cells in the tadpole. The number of cell division rounds in partial embryos derived from tissue-precursor blastomeres isolated at the 64-cell stage also varied between tissues and coincided with their counterparts in the intact whole embryos to some extent, suggesting tissue-autonomous regulation of cell division. Manipulation of cell fates in notochord, nerve cord, muscle, and mesenchyme lineage cells by inhibition or ectopic activation of the inductive FGF signal changed the number of cell divisions according to the altered fate. Knockdown and missexpression of Brachyury (Bra), an FGF-induced notochord-specific key transcription factor for notochord differentiation, indicated that Bra is also responsible for regulation of the number of cell division rounds, suggesting that Bra activates a putative mechanism to halt cell division at a specific stage. The outcome of precocious expression of Bra suggests that the mechanism involves a putative developmental clock that is likely shared in blastomeres other than those of notochord and functions to terminate cell division at three rounds after the 64-cell stage. Precocious expression of Bra has no effect on progression of the developmental clock itself.</str>

      <str>ES cells represent a valuable model for investigating early embryo development and hold promise for future regenerative medicine strategies. The self-renewal of pluripotent mouse ES cells has been shown to require extrinsic stimulation by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathways and the expression of the transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. However, the network of interactions among extrinsic and intrinsic determinants of ES cell pluripotency is currently poorly understood. Here, we show that Nanog expression is up-regulated in mouse ES cells by the binding of T (Brachyury) and STAT3 to an enhancer element in the mouse Nanog gene. We further show that Nanog blocks BMP-induced mesoderm differentiation of ES cells by physically interacting with Smad1 and interfering with the recruitment of coactivators to the active Smad transcriptional complexes. Taken together, our findings illustrate the existence of ES cell-specific regulatory networks that underlie the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency and provide mechanistic insights into the role of Nanog in this process.</str>

      <str>The study of axis extension and somitogenesis has been greatly advanced through the use of genetic tools such as the TCre mouse line. In this line, Cre is controlled by a fragment of the T (Brachyury) promoter that is active in progenitor cells that reside within the primitive streak and tail bud and which give rise to lineages emerging from these tissues as the embryonic axis extends. However, because TCre-mediated recombination occurs early in development, gene inactivation can result in an axis truncation that precludes the study of gene function in later or more posterior tissues. To address this limitation, we have generated an inducible TCre transgenic mouse line, called TCreERT2, that provides temporal control, through tamoxifen administration, in all cells emerging from the primitive streak or tail bud throughout development. TCreERT2 activity is mostly silent in the absence of tamoxifen and, in its presence, results in near complete recombination of emerging mesoderm from E7.5 through E13.5. We demonstrate the utility of the TCreERT2 line for determining rate of posterior axis extension and somite formation, thus providing the first in vivo tool for such measurements. To test the usefulness of TCreERT2 for genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that an early deletion of ß-Catenin via TCreERT2 induction phenocopies the TCre-mediated deletion of ß-Catenin defect, whereas a later induction bypasses this early phenotype and produces a similar defect in more caudal tissues. TCreERT2 provides a useful and novel tool for the control of gene expression of emerging embryonic lineages throughout development.</str>

      <str>Mammalian development requires commitment of cells to restricted lineages, which requires epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. Epigenetic modifications were examined during in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. Global histone acetylation, a euchromatin marker, declines dramatically within 1 day of differentiation induction and partially rebounds by day 2. Histone H3-Lys9 methylation, a heterochromatin marker, increases during in vitro differentiation. Conversely, the euchromatin marker H3-Lys4 methylation transiently decreases, then increases to undifferentiated levels by day 4, and decreases by day 6. Global cytosine methylation, another heterochromatin marker, increases slightly during ES cell differentiation. Chromatin structure of the Oct4 and Brachyury gene promoters is modulated in concert with their pattern of expression during ES cell differentiation. Importantly, prevention of global histone deacetylation by treatment with trichostatin A prevents ES cell differentiation. Hence, ES cells undergo functionally important global and gene-specific remodeling of chromatin structure during in vitro differentiation. genesis 38:32-38, 2004.</str>

      <str>Retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A, plays a pivotal role in vertebrate development. The level of RA may be determined by the balance between its synthesis and degradation. We have examined the role of CYP26, a P450 enzyme that may degrade RA, by generating mutant mice that lack CYP26. CYP26(-/-) mice exhibited anomalies, including caudal agenesis, similar to those induced by administration of excess RA. The concentration of endogenous RA, as revealed by marker gene activity, was markedly increased in the tailbud of the mutant animals, in which CYP26 is normally expressed. Expression of T (Brachyury) and Wnt3a in the tailbud was down-regulated in CYP26(-/-) mice, which may underlie the caudal truncation. The lack of CYP26 also resulted in homeotic transformation of vertebrae as well as in misspecification of the rostral hindbrain associated with anterior expansion of RA-positive domains. These results suggest that local degradation of RA by CYP26 is required for establishing an uneven distribution of RA along the anterio-posterior axis, which is essential for patterning the hindbrain, vertebrae, and tailbud.</str>

      <str>The establishment of the primitive streak and its derivative germ layers, mesoderm and endoderm, are prerequisite steps in the formation of many tissues. To model these developmental stages in vitro, an ES cell line was established that expresses CD4 from the foxa2 locus in addition to GFP from the brachyury locus. A GFP-Bry(+) population expressing variable levels of CD4-Foxa2 developed upon differentiation of this ES cell line. Analysis of gene-expression patterns and developmental potential revealed that the CD4-Foxa2(hi)GFP-Bry(+) population displays characteristics of the anterior primitive streak, whereas the CD4-Foxa2(lo)GFP-Bry(+) cells resemble the posterior streak. Using this model, we were able to demonstrate that Wnt and TGF-beta/nodal/activin signaling simultaneously were required for the generation of the CD4-Foxa2(+)GFP-Bry(+) population. Wnt or low levels of activin-induced a posterior primitive streak population, whereas high levels of activin resulted in an anterior streak fate. Finally, sustained activin signaling was found to stimulate endoderm commitment from the CD4-Foxa2(+)GFP-Bry(+) ES cell population. These findings demonstrate that the early developmental events involved in germ-layer induction in the embryo are recapitulated in the ES cell model and uncover insights into the signaling pathways involved in the establishment of mesoderm and endoderm.</str>

      <str>In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of an early embryoid body-derived colony, termed the transitional colony, which contains cell populations undergoing the commitment of mesoderm to the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Analysis of individual transitional colonies indicated that they express Brachyury as well as flk-1, SCL/tal-1, GATA-1, (beta)H1 and (beta)major reflecting the combination of mesodermal, hematopoietic and endothelial populations. This pattern differs from that found in the previously described hemangioblast-derived blast cell colonies in that they typically lacked Brachyury expression, consistent with their post-mesodermal stage of development (Kennedy, M., Firpo, M., Choi, K., Wall, C., Robertson, S., Kabrun, N. and Keller, G. (1997) Nature 386, 488-493). Replating studies demonstrated that transitional colonies contain low numbers of primitive erythroid precursors as well as a subset of precursors associated with early stage definitive hematopoiesis. Blast cell colonies contain higher numbers and a broader spectrum of definitive precursors than found in the transitional colonies. ES cells homozygous null for the SCL/tal-1 gene, a transcription factor known to be essential for development of the primitive and definitive hematopoietic systems, were not able to form blast colonies but did form transitional colonies. Together these findings suggest that the transitional colony represents a stage of development earlier than the blast cell colony and one that uniquely defines the requirement for a functional SCL/tal-1 gene for the progression to hematopoietic commitment.</str>

      <str>The chick, Gallus gallus, is the traditional model in avian developmental studies. Data on other bird species are scarce. Here, we present a comparative study of the embryonic development of the chick and the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae, a member of Paleognathae, which also includes the ostrich, rhea, tinamou, kiwi, and cassowary. Emu embryos ranging from Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) equivalent stages 1 to 43 were collected and their gross morphology analyzed. Its early development was studied in detail with time-lapse imaging and molecular techniques. Emu embryos in general take 2-3 times longer incubation time to reach equivalent chicken stages, requiring 1 day for HH2, 2.5 days for HH4, 7 days for limb bud initiation, 23 days for feather germ appearance, and approximately 50-56 days for hatching. Chordin gene expression is similar in emu and chick embryos, and emu Brachyury is not expressed until HH3. Circulation is established at approximately the 27- to 30-somite stage. Forelimb buds are formed and patterned initially, but their growth is severely retarded. The size difference between an emu and a chick embryo only becomes apparent after limb bud formation. Overall, emu and chick embryogenesis proceeds through similar stages, but developmental heterochrony between these two species is widely observed.</str>

      <str>An important question in developmental biology is how the number of cells constituting the body is regulated during development. After termination of cell divisions, cells enter the postmitotic phase, but the mechanisms determining the timing of final cell division remain unclear. In ascidians, the egg develops into a tadpole larva consisting of a relatively small number of cells (approximately 2800), indicating that embryonic cells divide 11.5 times on average after fertilization, although the number of cell division rounds differs among tissues. This article discusses the possible mechanisms that control the timing of the final cell division: these include (i) the analog and digital clock models, in which the elapsed time and number of cell division cycles are measured after fertilization, respectively, and (ii) the analog and digital timer models, in which the elapsed time and number of cell divisions are measured after cell fate specification, respectively. In notochord and muscle cells of ascidian embryos, cell division termination involves cell fate specification by inductive FGF signaling, followed by activation of the tissue-specific key transcription factors, Brachyury and Tbx6, which then induce gene expression of an effector, Cdk inhibitor. The present evidence suggests that these timing mechanisms comprise two functional phases: (i) an analog timer, which is mediated by accumulation of Cdk inhibitor protein after cell fate specification, and (ii) a timekeeper, which confines the timing, when the above timer is triggered by Brachyury and Tbx6, to the appropriate stage. </str>

      <str>Brachyury plays a pivotal role in the notochord formation in ascidian embryos. Ciona intestinalis Noto4 (Ci-Noto4) was isolated as a gene downstream of Ci-Bra. This gene encodes a 307 amino-acid protein with a C-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PTB/PID). Expression of Ci-Noto4 commences at the neural plate stage and is specific to notochord cells. Suppression of Ci-Noto4 levels with specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in the formation of two rows of notochord cells owing to a lack of midline intercalation between the bilateral populations of progenitor cells. In contrast, overexpression of Ci-Noto4 by injection of a Ci-Bra(promoter):Ci-Noto4-EGFP construct into fertilized eggs disrupted the localization of notochord cells. Ci-Noto4 overexpression did not affect cellular differentiation in the notochord, muscle, mesenchyme, or nervous system. Analysis of Ci-Noto4 regions that are responsible for its function suggested significant roles for the PTB/PID and a central region, an area with no obvious sequence similarity to other known proteins. These results suggested that PTB/PID-containing Ci-Noto4 is essential for midline intercalation of notochord cells in chordate embryos.</str>

      <str>It has been known for several years that the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have potent mesoderm-inducing activity. As a result they have been considered good candidates for one of the endogenous vegetally localized mesoderm-inducing signals in the amphibian Xenopus laevis. In this review the properties of the FGFs and their expression patterns in Xenopus are described. Recent work is discussed which reveals a close link between FGF signalling and regulation of the Xenopus brachyury (Xbra) gene. These data are used to build a model of FGF function which is quite different from what was originally conceived. Present evidence supports the view that during blastula stages the FGFs do not act as vegetally localized inducing signals. Instead, they are required in the animal hemisphere as competence factors, which provide a low level stimulation of the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway. FGF activity is necessary for the full range of responses to the vegetal inducing signals, including the activation of Xbra transcription in the marginal zone of the late blastula. Xbra is able to activate the zygotic transcription of eFGF, which suggests that there is a period of autocatalytic activation of eFGF and Xbra transcription within the forming mesoderm of the marginal zone. FGF activity continues to be required to maintain the expression of a sub-set of mesodermal genes, including Xbra, in the blastopore region and possibly also in the notochord through gastrula and neurula stages. In addition a role for the FGFs in anteroposterior specification and development of the myogenic lineages is discussed.</str>

      <str>A common feature of development in most vertebrate models is the early segregation of the germ line from the soma. For example, in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified by germ plasm that is inherited from the egg; in mice, Blimp1 expression in the epiblast mediates the commitment of cells to the germ line. How these disparate mechanisms of PGC specification evolved is unknown. Here, in order to identify the ancestral mechanism of PGC specification in vertebrates, we studied PGC specification in embryos from the axolotl (Mexican salamander), a model for the tetrapod ancestor. In the axolotl, PGCs develop within mesoderm, and classic studies have reported their induction from primitive ectoderm (animal cap). We used an axolotl animal cap system to demonstrate that signalling through FGF and BMP4 induces PGCs. The role of FGF was then confirmed in vivo. We also showed PGC induction by Brachyury, in the presence of BMP4. These conditions induced pluripotent mesodermal precursors that give rise to a variety of somatic cell types, in addition to PGCs. Irreversible restriction of the germ line did not occur until the mid-tailbud stage, days after the somatic germ layers are established. Before this, germline potential was maintained by MAP kinase signalling. We propose that this stochastic mechanism of PGC specification, from mesodermal precursors, is conserved in vertebrates.</str>

      <str>The cellular and molecular events underlying the formation and differentiation of mesoderm to derivatives such as blood are critical to our understanding of the development and function of many tissues and organ systems. How different mesodermal populations are set aside to form specific lineages is not well understood. Although previous genetic studies in the mouse embryo have pointed to a critical role for the homeobox gene Mix-like (mMix) in gastrulation, its function in mesoderm development remains unclear. Hematopoietic defects have been identified in differentiating embryonic stem cells in which mMix was genetically inactivated. Here we show that conditional induction of mMix in embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies results in the early activation of mesodermal markers prior to expression of Brachyury/T and acceleration of the mesodermal developmental program. Strikingly, increased numbers of mesodermal, hemangioblastic, and hematopoietic progenitors form in response to premature activation of mMix. Differentiation to primitive (embryonic) and definitive (adult type) blood cells proceeds normally and without an apparent bias in the representation of different hematopoietic cell fates. Therefore, the mouse Mix gene functions early in the recruitment and/or expansion of mesodermal progenitors to the hemangioblastic and hematopoietic lineages.</str>

Moreover, the tumor appears to be elaborating an abundant matrix of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharide interspersed with collagen fibers in varying stages of maturation. These features suggest that the tumor is exhibiting chondroid, rather than chordoid, differentiation.

      <str>Early porcine conceptus development is characterized by rapid trophoblastic elongation between Days 11 and 12 of pregnancy, a period of embryonic loss in the pig. Growth factors and steroids secreted by the conceptus and uterus, as well as ligand receptors produced by the conceptus, are thought to regulate trophoblastic elongation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize conceptus gene expression for the steroidogenic enzymes 17alpha-hydroxylase and aromatase and the mesodermal marker brachyury, as well as the expression of receptors for fibronectin (integrin beta-1), progesterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prostaglandin F2alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), prior to and during trophoblastic elongation. Total RNA was extracted from individual conceptuses from Day 10 to Day 12 of pregnancy. Gene expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on conceptuses having 2- to 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10- to 12-mm spherical, 13- to 25-mm tubular, and &gt; 100-mm filamentous morphologies. There was a stage of development effect on both 17alpha-hydroxylase (p &lt; 0.001) and aromatase (p &lt; 0.003) gene expression. Initial 17alpha-hydroxylase gene expression was detected in early spherical conceptuses (2-4 mm), increasing abruptly through to 7-mm conceptuses. Aromatase gene expression increased dramatically in 6- to 7-mm conceptuses, with increased expression throughout development. Gene expression for LIF receptor (LIFR) (p &lt; 0.02) was similar to that for 17alpha-hydroxylase, while brachyury gene expression began in 6-mm conceptuses and increased (p &lt; 0.001) throughout development. Integrin beta-1 was expressed at all stages of development. Conceptus gene expression was not detected for progesterone, estrogen, oxytocin, and prostaglandin F2alpha receptors. Prior to elongation, dynamic changes in gene expression are occurring that appear to be associated with estrogen production and preparation of the conceptuses for elongation. LIFR expression is highly associated with steroidogenic enzyme production with an initial peak preceding rapid trophoblastic elongation, suggesting that LIF may be involved in early conceptus development in the pig.</str>

In osteosarcoma cultured cells from OST (Human) and Dunn (Mouse), proliferation was clearly inhibited on being heated to 42 approximately 43 degrees C. On heat-treating the femurs of pigs, a rise in temperature to 42.5 degrees C or above was observed so that an antitumor effect could be anticipated. Moreover, no abnormal rise in temperature in the tissues surrounding the bone and light microscopy revealed no particular abnormalities. Clinically, a rise in temperature above 42.5 degrees C was observed in the majority of the malignant bone tumors (4 cases of osteosarcoma and 1 case of chordoma) and soft tissue tumors (1 case of epithelioid sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma and osteosarcoma) of which 2 cases were metastatic tumors. Before administration, 7 patients complained of pain, 4 of whom (57%) experienced an alleviation following treatment. Also in 5 (50%) out of 10 cases a shrinking of the tumor was observed and especially, in the case of soft tissue tumors a tendency towards a softening of tumor texture was seen.</str>

      <str>Lectin histochemical studies of human fetal notochord, ecchordosis physaliphora, and eight chordomas were performed. Ecchordosis physaliphora and eight chordomas were stained with Ricinus communis type I, Canavalia ensiformis, Triticum vulgaris, and Limax flavus. Ricinus communis type I, T vulgaris, and L flavus reacted with both tumor cells and the extracellular mucinous matrix, while C ensiformis mainly reacted with the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Thus, tumor cells were most recognizable with the C ensiformis stain. After neuraminidase treatment, ecchordosis physaliphora and chordomas invariably showed positivities for Arachis hypogaea. The lectin-binding patterns of chordomas closely reflected those of the human fetal notochord. Chordomas were completely sialylated regardless of either the clinical course or histopathological findings. Among the eight lectins, C ensiformis heavily labeled chordoma cells but not extracellular space. This was probably because asparagine-linked N-glycosylation was active in the chordomas, while the high-mannose-type oligosaccharides were apt to remain in the cytoplasm.</str>

      <str>To study the clinicopathologic features, immunophenotype and differential diagnosis of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC).</str>
      <str>The clinicopathologic features of 5 cases of EMC (during the period from 2008 to 2013) were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical study (EnVision method) was carried out using the archival material. The literature was reviewed.</str>
      <str>There were altogether 3 female patients and 2 male patients. Their age ranged from 38 to 63 years (average = 51 years). The patients primarily presented with a tender soft tissue mass. All the tumors studied were solitary and the duration of disease onset varied from 3 months to 1 year. The sites of involvement included toe (number = 2), intracranial (number = 1), thigh (number = 1) and shoulder (number = 1). Gross examination showed white nodular masses with a gelatinous cut surface. The average tumor size measured 5.2 cm in greatest dimension. Histologically, a multinodular architecture with fibrous or loose fibrovascular septa separating lobules of tumor cells was identified. The lobules contained abundant myxoid stroma, with peripheral accentuation of tumor cellularity. Two cases were diagnosed as cellular variant of EMC, with invasive growth pattern and hemorrhage. The tumor cells in cellular EMC were arranged in solid nodules, with rare myxoid matrix in between. The nuclei were relatively uniform, round to oval and contained prominent nucleoli. The mitotic figure ranged from 5 to 10 per 10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemical study showed that all of the 5 cases were positive for vimentin, mitochondria and CD56. Two cases expressed synaptophysin and NSE. Focal positivity for these neuroendocrine markers was detected in the other 2 cases. Chromogranin and S-100 protein expression was demonstrated in 2 cases. The staining for epithelial membrane antigen was positive in case 2 and negative in the other 4 cases. CD117 showed diffuse positivity in case 1, the other 4 cases were not expressed.</str>
      <str>EMC is a rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by distinctive histopathologic features and often shows neuroendocrine differentiation. Although EMC is a slow-growing tumor, it carries a high local recurrence rate and even metastases, warranting long-term follow up.</str>

      <str>We have previously shown the presence of an activated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) B and its ligand PDGFB in a limited number of patients with clinical and radiological responses to imatinib mesylate treatment. This article describes the results of comprehensive molecular/biochemical analyses of the three receptors targeted by the drug (PDGFRB, PDGFRA, and KIT) in a series of 31 chordoma patients.</str>
      <str>The presence and activation status of PDGFRB, PDGFRA, and KIT receptors were investigated by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses complemented by immunohistochemistry, their expression level was analyzed by means of real-time PCR, and the occurrence of activating point mutations was investigated by means of cDNA sequencing. The PDGFB, PDGFA, and stem cell factor cognate ligands were investigated by reverse transcription-PCR, and gene status was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.</str>
      <str>The results show that PDGFRB was highly expressed and phosphorylated, whereas PDGFRA and KIT were less expressed but phosphorylated and thus activated. These findings, together with the absence of gain-of-function mutations and the presence of the cognate ligands, strongly support the hypothesis that the activation mechanism is the autocrine/paracrine loop. No role seems to be played by gene amplification.</str>
      <str>In the light of our findings, the clinical benefit observed in chordoma patients treated with imatinib seems to be attributable to the switching off of all three receptors.</str>

      <str>We adopted stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to treat primary malignant spinal tumors. The objective of this study was to evaluate local control rate and to identify prognostic factors after SRS for primary malignant spinal tumors.</str>
      <str>Medical records and radiological data for 29 patients with primary malignant spinal tumors were retrospectively analyzed. The histological diagnoses were chordoma (11 cases), chondrosarcoma (5 cases), osteosarcoma (3 cases), synovial sarcoma (3 cases), plasmacytoma (2 cases), Ewing sarcoma (2 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (2 cases), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1 case). Patient age ranged from 11 to 68 years (median, 46 years). Surgical resection and percutaneous biopsy were chosen as initial treatments in 25 and 4 cases, respectively. Stereotactic radiosurgery was used as primary treatment method in 14 cases and as a salvage treatment for progressed lesions in 15 cases. Distant metastasis was noted in two sarcoma patients. Eleven patients had undergone previous conventional external beam radiation therapy (cEBRT) before SRS. Overall survival, local progression-free survival, and the prognostic factors affecting local recurrence were investigated.</str>
      <str>Tumor volume ranged from 2·0 to 235 cc (median, 14 cc). Delivered radiation doses were from 12 to 50 Gy with two to six sessions. The mean radiation dose converted into a biological effective dose (BED) was 60 Gy (range, 43-105 Gy). The mean follow-up period was 50 months (range, 8-126 months). The mean overall survival was 84 months for chordoma patients and 104 months for sarcoma patients. No factors that affected overall survival were found. The mean local progression-free survival was 56 months for chordoma patients and 73 months for sarcoma patients. The recurrent mode of presentation was predictive of local progression of spinal sarcomas (P  =  0·009). However, in chordoma patients, no factors were found to correlate with local recurrence.</str>

      <str>To introduce the application of navigation system with software for brain surgery to the upper cervical spine of patients who have previously had occipitocervical (O-C) fusion.</str>
      <str>The anterior approach to the spine using a navigation system with software for spine surgery is difficult because the registration tends to be inaccurate. However, after O-C fusion, the upper cervical spine is considered part of the skull, and a navigation system with software for brain surgery in which the registration is performed using the head with several markers attached to it can be applied.</str>
      <str>Three patients with previous O-C fusion-2 with upper cervical chordoma and 1 with a disc herniation at C2/3-were treated using this technique.</str>
      <str>In the first case, with a huge retropharyngeal C1 chordoma, this technique was very helpful in blindly dissecting the nonvisible parts of the tumor. In the second case, with a C2 chordoma, the vertebral arteries were successfully exposed under the guidance of the navigation system at both primary and revision surgery. In the third case, with disc herniation at C2/3, the herniated disc was removed successfully with the totally fused spine. In this application, computed tomography images can be merged freely with magnetic resonance images, which is helpful to clarify the soft tissues such as tumor, disc herniation, or the dural tube.</str>
      <str>This technique greatly supports surgeons inexperienced in the anterior approach to the upper cervical spine or surgeons at revision surgery who may be lost in and daunted by an unfamiliar operation field surrounded by important structures. Although an anterior approach to the upper cervical spine in the patient with O-C fusion may rarely be required, this application should be considered.</str>

      <str>To gain the insight into the involvement of signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the phenotype and biological profiles of tumors and tumor-like lesions of the bone and soft tissue, we analyzed the expression and phosphorylation (activation) of mTOR and its correlation with the status of upstream and downstream modulator proteins Akt, p70S6-kinase (S6K), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which we refer to collectively as mTOR cassette proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis of 140 cases showed activation of Akt in 55% (61% in malignant and 27% in benign), and mTOR expression in 61% (66% in malignant and 39% in benign). The preponderance of mTOR activation was found in tumors of peripheral nerve sheath (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and schwannoma), skeletal muscle origin (rhabdomyosarcoma), and in those exhibiting epithelial nature (chordoma and synovial sarcoma). Together with the result of immunoblotting analysis, it was shown that many of those particular tumors with mTOR activation exhibited activation of Akt, S6K, and 4E-BP1, suggesting the constitutive activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, although activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway was largely independent of activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutation of EGFR was frequently accompanied by constitutive activation of Akt-mTOR-S6K/4E-BP1. By clinicopathological analysis, activation of Akt correlates with statistically higher probability of metastasis. We conclude that mTOR-mediated signaling proteins function not only in the proliferation of the tumor cells, but also in the differentiation and/or maintenance of morphological phenotypes in tumors of rhabdomyoblastic and nerve sheath cell origin. Furthermore, mTOR signaling may also modulate morphogenesis of tumors exhibiting epithelial nature. Additionally, activated Akt may have a function in metastasis. Overall, these results suggest that inhibitors of mTOR cassette may be useful as novel components of combined chemotherapy for a defined subset of bone and soft tissue sarcomas.</str>

Irradiation combined high-energy photons and protons. Photons represented 2/3 of the total dose and protons 1/3. The median total dose delivered within gross tumour volume was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) (60-70).</str>
      <str>With a mean follow-up of 32 months (4-71), the 3-year local control rates were for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of 70.8% and 85.2%, respectively and 4-year overall survival rates of 87.7% and 75%, respectively. Fourteen tumours (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the gross tumor volume, four into the CTV and 2 in an unknown site). Seven patients died of tumour and one of intercurrent disease. In univariate analysis, age inférieur ou égal à 52.3 years (p = 0.002), maximum tumoral diameter &lt; 44.7 mm (p = 0.02) and GTV &lt; 28.4 mL (0.02), at time of radiotherapy, influenced positively the local control. According to multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of local control. Only five (7.7%) patients presented grade 3 or 4 complications.</str>

This included both surgical and non-surgical studies on the management of sacral chordomas.</str>
      <str>Sacrectomy with wide resection margins forms the mainstay of treatment but is associated with high risk of disease recurrence and reduced long-term survival. Adequate resection margins may require sacrifice of adjacent nerve roots, musculature and ligaments leading to functional compromise and mechanical instability. Large tumour size (greater than 5-10 cm in diameter), dedifferentiation and greater cephalad tumour extension are associated with increased risk of disease recurrence and reduced survival. Chordomas are poorly responsive to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</str>

      <str>We report our early experience with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in palliative supportive care. The medical files of eight patients were retrospectively reviewed. Four patients had a renal tumor, and nephrectomy was contraindicated in each patient since they had a poor general status. The fifth patient had a local recurrence in the site of a previous nephrectomy with a pancreatic tail extension, and surgical resection was contraindicated because of abdominal carcinomatosis. Two other patients had bone metastasis, one with a painful metastasis of mammary carcinoma in the head of the humerus resistant to radiotherapy, and the other with metastasis of the tibia of cutaneous melanoma. The last patient had a local recurrence of a sacral chordoma. Management, outcomes and complications were evaluated with 13.1+/-0.3 months follow-up. All five patients with renal carcinomas did not have local recurrence. The two patients treated for bone metastases had no pain 8 weeks after RFA and remained stable over time. One complication occurred 2 months after using the procedure to treat the chordoma, and this patient was hospitalized for a fistula between the sigmoid and hypogastric artery false aneurysm and subsequently died. In conclusion, RFA can be a safe and useful adjuvant treatment in supportive care or unresponsive cancer pain patients. However, the destruction of tumoral tissues in contact with sensitive structures using RFA should be done with caution due to potentially severe complications.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare neoplasm that arises from embryonic notochordal remnants along the axial skeleton (i.e., clivus, sacrum) and the vertebral bodies. They comprise less than 1 % of CNS tumors and 1-4 % of all bone malignancies. It rarely affects children and adolescents (&lt;5 %). Chordomas are locally aggressive and highly recurrent. Their management is challenging for clinicians.</str>
      <str>This retrospective study includes six pediatric patients with pathological evidence of clival chordoma. These cases were identified over a period of 15 years in a tertiary care institute.</str>
      <str>There were two boy and four girls with a mean age of 10.6 years (range, 4-16 years). The chief complaint was due to cranial nerve palsy (or dysfunction), mostly affecting lower cranial nerves (66.6 %), followed by diplopia and headache. One patient had obstructive sleep apnea. All patients were operated and a total of 15 surgeries were performed (mean, 2.5). Tumor recurrence was observed in four patients (67 %). Two-year and 5-year progression-free survivals (PFS) were 67 and 33 %, respectively. None of the patients were lost either during the surgery or the follow-up period (6.9 years: 1-14 years).</str>
      <str>Clival chordomas are challenging tumors in neurosurgical practice. A multidisciplinary approach is warranted in each patient. Today, the best management strategy seems to be surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy should be considered in selective and preference basis.

      <str>To assess the efficacy of definitive treatment of sacral chordoma by high-dose proton/photon-beam radiation therapy alone or combined with surgery.</str>
      <str>The records of 16 primary and 11 recurrent sacral chordoma patients treated from November 1982 to November 2002 by proton/photon radiation therapy alone (6 patients) or combined with surgery (21 patients) have been analyzed for local control, survival, and treatment-related morbidity. The outcome analysis is based on follow-up information as of 2005.</str>
      <str>Outcome results show a large difference in local failure rate between patients treated for primary and recurrent chordomas. Local control results by surgery and radiation were 12/14 vs. 1/7 for primary and recurrent lesions. For margin-positive patients, local control results were 10 of 11 and 0 of 5 in the primary and recurrent groups, respectively; the mean follow-up on these locally controlled patients was 8.8 years (4 at 10.3, 12.8, 17, and 21 years).

      <str>The nonhealing perineal wound is often a catastrophic complication after aggressive surgical extirpation of pelvic malignancies.</str>
      <str>Eleven patients underwent perineal reconstruction using an inferiorly based transpelvic transverse rectus abdominal myocutaneous (TRAM) flap for large nonhealing postsurgical perineal wounds. After debridement of the perineum, the rectus muscles and their skin islands were mobilized, preserving their inferior epigastric blood supply. The flap was then taken through the midline abdominal incision transpelvically into the perineal defect. The study population was composed of three men and eight women ranging in age from 43 to 76 years (mean 59). The primary diagnosis was recurrent carcinoma of the rectum or anus (n = 5), recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or cervix (n = 4), and recurrent sacral chordoma (n = 2). All patients had received adjuvant radiation therapy and all patients had undergone one to four previous attempts at perineal closure. The perineal defect ranged in size from 72 cm2 to 1,250 cm2 (mean 337).</str>
      <str>There were no perioperative deaths. Ten of the 11 patients (91%) had primary wound healing of the TRAM flap, perineal wound, and donor site. One patient with recurrent chordoma developed recurrent tumor at the suture line 4 months postoperatively.</str>

      <str>Primary tumors of the axial skeleton are rare and a survey of the Leeds Regional Bone Tumor Registry found them to constitute only 55 of the 1950 cases (2.8%). Chordoma was the most frequent tumor in the cervical and sacral regions as well as the most common diagnosis overall and osteosarcoma ranked second. Pain was the most frequent presenting symptom but over half the patients developed some neurological abnormality. In spite of treatment survival was poor in patients with malignant lesions or neurological involvement. The establishment of Bone Tumor Registries is the only way that sufficient data on large numbers of these rare tumours can be amassed to provide a valuable and otherwise unavailable source of information for research, education and service.</str>

      <str>The brain, heart and gastro-intestinal tract develop distinct left-right (LR) asymmetries. Asymmetric cilia-dependent fluid flow in the embryonic node in mouse, Kupffer's vesicle in zebrafish, notochordal plate in rabbit and gastrocoel roof plate in frog appears to be a conserved mechanism that directs LR asymmetric gene expression and establishes the orientation of organ asymmetry. However, the cellular processes and genetic pathways that control the formation of these essential ciliated structures are unknown. In zebrafish, migratory dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) give rise to Kupffer's vesicle (KV), a ciliated epithelial sheet that forms a lumen and generates fluid flow. Using the epithelial marker atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) and other markers to analyze DFCs and KV cells, we describe a multi-step process by which DFCs form a functional KV. Using mutants and morpholinos, we show that two T-box transcription factors-No tail (Ntl)/Brachyury and Tbx16/Spadetail-cooperatively regulate an early step of DFC mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) and KV cell specification. Subsequently, each transcription factor independently controls a distinct step in KV formation: Tbx16 regulates apical clustering of KV cells and Ntl is necessary for KV lumen formation. By targeting morpholinos to DFCs, we show that these cell autonomous functions in KV morphogenesis are necessary for LR patterning throughout the embryo.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells are pluripotent and have the capacity to differentiate into many cell types. The ability to direct their differentiation should have considerable practical applications. Here, we first report the use of diced short interfering RNAi against Oct4 in a transient approach, to direct differentiation of ES towards the trophectoderm lineage. We then apply this approach to downregulate Smad4 in mouse P19 EC cells. We have found that this leads to an increase in the levels of Pax6 (a neuroectoderm marker), reduction in the levels of Brachyury (a mesoderm marker), and a 3-fold increase in the number of betaIII tubulin-positive colonies when these cells were allowed to differentiate. This indicates a redirection of cell fate towards the neuroectoderm lineage. Thus, transient RNAi could provide a valuable tool to direct pluripotent cells along specific pathways of differentiation while circumventing permanent genetic changes.</str>

      <str>Pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells are tissue-committed cells, which can differentiate into all kinds of pancreatic cells. They are potential candidates for regeneration of pancreatic tissue. However, it is unfeasible to acquire PP cells from pancreatic tissues and expand them in vitro. Generation of PP cells from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) would provide an unlimited source of PP cells. Here we developed a 2-step stepwise protocol, which induced AD-MSCs to generate FOXA2- or SOX17-positive definitive endoderm (DE) (5 days) and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (PDX1)-positive PP cells (4-6 days). By mimicking the developmental progress in embryonic development, we optimized the timing and combination of cytokines to activate the key signaling pathways during pancreatic development. We found that activating the Nodal/Activin signal with Activin A could induce differentiation of AD-MSCs toward DE, which could be further promoted by the Wnt signaling pathway activator Wnt3a. Besides, transient T (BRACHYURY)(+) mesendodermal cells were observed during formation of DE from AD-MSCs. Subsequently, the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dkk1 along with retinoic acid/FGF2 (60 ng/mL) further induced AD-MSC-derived DE cells to differentiate into PDX1-positive PP cells. The derived PP cells were capable to form pancreatic endocrine or exocrine cells. In conclusion, we established a stepwise protocol that could derive DE and PP cells from AD-MSCs. It might provide an unlimited source of autologous PP cells for pancreatic diseases.</str>

      <str>The ability to regulate gene activity in a spatiotemporally controllable manner is vital for biological discovery that will impact disease diagnosis and treatment. While conditional gene silencing is possible in other genetic model organisms, this technology is largely unavailable in zebrafish, an important vertebrate model organism for functional gene discovery. Here, using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed in the microRNA-30 backbone, which have been shown to mimic natural microRNA primary transcripts and be more effective than simple shRNAs, we report stable RNA interference-mediated gene silencing in zebrafish employing the yeast Gal4-UAS system. Using this approach, we reveal at single-cell resolution the role of atypical protein kinase Cλ (aPKCλ) in regulating neural progenitor/stem cell division. We also show effective silencing of the one-eyed-pinhead and no-tail/brachyury genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate stable integration and germ-line transmission of the UAS-miR-shRNAs for aPKCλ, the expressivity of which is controllable by the strength and expression of Gal4. This technology shall significantly advance the utility of zebrafish for understanding fundamental vertebrate biology and for the identification and evaluation of important therapeutic targets.</str>

      <str>A novel family of transcription factors that appears to play a critical role in the development of all animal species was recently uncovered on the basis of homology of the DNA binding domain of the Brachyury, or T locus, gene product. Phylogenetic studies have shown the ancient origin of this gene family, which has been named the T-box family, prior to the divergence of metazoa from a common ancestral type. T-box genes have now been identified in the genomes of C. elegans, Drosophila, sea urchin, ascidian, amphioxus, Xenopus, chick, zebrafish, mouse, and human and will probably be found in the genomes of all animals. Although functional analyses of T-box family members have just begun, the results show a wide range of roles in developmental processes that extend over time from the unfertilized egg through organogenesis. Only a few mutations in T-box genes are known, but all have drastic effects on development, including a targeted mutation in mice causing an embryonic lethal phenotype, and two human T-box gene mutations that results in developmental syndromes. This review presents a current overview of progress made in the analysis of T-box genes and their products in a variety of model systems.</str>

      <str>The visceral musculature of the larval midgut of Drosophila has a lattice-type structure and consists of an inner stratum of circular fibers and an outer stratum of longitudinal fibers. The longitudinal fibers originate from the posterior tip of the mesoderm anlage, which has been termed the caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM). In this study, we investigate the specification of the CVM and particularly the role of the Drosophila Brachyury-homologue brachyenteron. Supported by fork head, brachyenteron mediates the early specification of the CVM along with zinc-finger homeodomain protein-1. This is the first function described for brachyenteron or fork head in the mesoderm of Drosophila. The mode of cooperation resembles the interaction of the Xenopus homologues Xbra and Pintallavis. Another function of brachyenteron is to establish the surface properties of the CVM cells, which are essential for their orderly migration along the trunk-derived visceral mesoderm. During this movement, the CVM cells, under the control of brachyenteron, induce the formation of one muscle/pericardial precursor cell in each parasegment. We propose that the functions of brachyenteron in mesodermal development of Drosophila are comparable to the roles of the vertebrate Brachyury genes during gastrulation.</str>

      <str>In vitro recapitulation of mammalian embryogenesis and examination of the emerging behaviours of embryonic structures require both the means to engineer complexity and accurately assess phenotypes of multicellular aggregates. Current approaches to study multicellular populations in 3D configurations are limited by the inability to create complex (i.e. spatially heterogeneous) environments in a reproducible manner with high fidelity thus impeding the ability to engineer microenvironments and combinations of cells with similar complexity to that found during morphogenic processes such as development, remodelling and wound healing. Here, we develop a multicellular embryoid body (EB) fusion technique as a higher-throughput in vitro tool, compared to a manual assembly, to generate developmentally relevant embryonic patterns. We describe the physical principles of the EB fusion microfluidic device design; we demonstrate that &gt;60 conjoined EBs can be generated overnight and emulate a development process analogous to mouse gastrulation during early embryogenesis. Using temporal delivery of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) to embryoid bodies, we recapitulate embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) during mouse embryo development with induced mesoderm differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells leading to expression of Brachyury-T-green fluorescent protein (T-GFP), an indicator of primitive streak development and mesoderm differentiation during gastrulation. The proposed microfluidic approach could be used to manipulate hundreds or more of individual embryonic cell aggregates in a rapid fashion, thereby allowing controlled differentiation patterns in fused multicellular assemblies to generate complex yet spatially controlled microenvironments. </str>

      <str>Heparan sulfate (HS) has been implicated in regulating cell fate decisions during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into advanced cell types. However, the necessity and the underlying molecular mechanisms of HS in early cell lineage differentiation are still largely unknown. In this study, we examined the potential of EXT1(-/-) mouse ESCs (mESCs), that are deficient in HS, to differentiate into primary germ layer cells. We observed that EXT1(-/-) mESCs lost their differentiation competence and failed to differentiate into Pax6(+)-neural precursor cells and mesodermal cells. More detailed analyses highlighted the importance of HS for the induction of Brachyury(+) pan-mesoderm as well as normal gene expression associated with the dorso-ventral patterning of mesoderm. Examination of developmental cell signaling revealed that EXT1 ablation diminished FGF and BMP but not Wnt signaling. Furthermore, restoration of FGF and BMP signaling each partially rescued mesoderm differentiation defects. We further show that BMP4 is more prone to degradation in EXT1(-/-) mESCs culture medium compared with that of wild type cells. Therefore, our data reveal that HS stabilizes BMP ligand and thereby maintains the BMP signaling output required for normal mesoderm differentiation. In summary, our study demonstrates that HS is required for ESC pluripotency, in particular lineage specification into mesoderm through facilitation of FGF and BMP signaling.</str>

      <str>During axis formation in amniotes, posterior and lateral epiblast cells in the area pellucida undergo a counter-rotating movement along the midline to form primitive streak (Polonaise movements). Using chick blastoderms, we investigated the signaling involved in this cellular movement in epithelial-epiblast. In cultured posterior blastoderm explants from stage X to XI embryos, either Lefty1 or Cerberus-S inhibited initial migration of the explants on chamber slides. In vivo analysis showed that inhibition of Nodal signaling by Lefty1 affected the movement of DiI-marked epiblast cells prior to the formation of primitive streak. In Lefty1-treated embryos without a primitive streak, Brachyury expression showed a patchy distribution. However, SU5402 did not affect the movement of DiI-marked epiblast cells. Multi-cellular rosette, which is thought to be involved in epithelial morphogenesis, was found predominantly in the posterior half of the epiblast, and Lefty1 inhibited the formation of rosettes. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed two types of rosette, one with a protruding cell, the other with a ventral hollow. Our results suggest that Nodal signaling may have a pivotal role in the morphogenetic movements of epithelial epiblast including Polonaise movements and formation of multi-cellular rosette.</str>

      <str>Differentiating mouse ES cells were treated with suramin (500 µM) from day 5 to 7 of embryoid body formation, and cells were analysed for their differentiation potential via morphological analysis, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and patch clamp analysis.</str>
      <str>Application of suramin resulted in an increased number of cardiac cells, but inhibition of neuronal, skeletal muscle and definitive endoderm differentiation. Immediately after suramin treatment, a decreased mesendoderm differentiation was found. Brachyury, FGF10, Wnt8 and Wnt3a transcript levels were significantly down-regulated, followed by a decrease in mesoderm- and cardiac progenitor-specific markers BMP2, GATA4/5, Wnt11, Isl1, Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 immediately after removal of the substance. With continued differentiation, a significant up-regulation of Brachyury, FGF10 and GATA5 transcript levels was observed, whereas Nkx2.5, Isl1, Tbx5, BMP2 and Wnt11 levels were normalized to control levels. At advanced differentiation stages, sinus node-specific HCN4, Tbx2 and Tbx3 transcript levels were significantly up-regulated. Immunofluorescence and patch-clamp analysis confirmed the increased number of sinus node-like cells, and electrophysiological analysis revealed a lower number of atrial- and ventricular-like cardiomyocytes following suramin treatment.</str>

      <str>In the sellar region most tumors of our collection (n = 1937) are pituitary adenomas, followed by craniopharyngiomas, chordomas and meningiomas. Difficulties in morphological differential diagnosis by light microscopy may occur in meningiomas, plasmacytomas, chordomas and germinomas. In these cases, immunohistological investigations and sometimes even electron microscopy are helpful in solving the problems. Meningiomas can sometimes resemble pituitary adenomas. Of diagnostic value in these cases is the expression of vimentin and S-100-protein in the meningioma cells. Plasmacytomas may also mimic pituitary adenomas. In these cases, the positive reaction with antibodies against LCA and immunoglobulins or against kappa-light-chains and lambda-light-chains leads to the diagnosis. Chordomas, too, can sometimes be hardly distinguished from pituitary adenomas. In these cases, the expression of S-100-protein, vimentin and CEA by the chordoma cells and the typical electron microscopic features of chordomas are helpful for the differential diagnosis. Germinomas may sometimes be indistinguishable from lymphocytic hypophysitis. Of diagnostic importance are here the expression of HCG and placental alkaline phosphatase by germinoma cells.

All the immunohistochemical markers, which had been used for the characterization of these sarcomas were re-examined. Additionally, the Streptavidin-Biotin peroxidase method was performed on paraffin sections using the monoclonal antibodies: anti-p53 antibody DO7, anti-MDM-2 antibody IF2 and anti-Ki-67 antibody MIB-1. According to our results, p53 protein nuclear expression was detected in 20% (8/40) of the tumours (1 fibrosarcoma, 2 liposarcomas, 1 leiomyosarcoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 2 Ewing's sarcomas and 1 unclassified sarcoma). MDM-2 nuclear staining was determined in 7.5% (3/40) of the cases (1 MFH and 2 liposarcomas).

In conclusion, from this limited and heterogeneous sample of cases, we suggest that the p53/MDM-2 pathway is involved in the tumourigenesis of several sarcoma subtypes, but it is unclear if the overexpression of these genes may become prognostic marker for patients affected with these highly aggressive tumours.</str>

Input parameters representing the clinical endpoints late toxicity in the central nervous system and the tumor control for chordoma were chosen to investigate the impact of changes on the predicted isoeffective dose levels. The recalculated RBE-weighted dose distributions show an increase within the target region, and the mean RBE-weighted dose values are dependent on the geometry and decrease with increasing target dimension. The differences between predictions of LEM IV and LEM I are less than 10% for typical tumor volumes treated in the pilot project at GSI. Median RBE-weighted doses predicted by LEM IV in the target region are consistent with clinically observed dose-response behavior as demonstrated by comparison to the 5-year local control curve for skull base chordoma.</str>

      <str>The present study consists of 651 cases of soft tissue tumors originating in the head and neck area. Among these tumors 628 were benign (96%), while there were only 23 malignant cases (4%). In the benign group hemangiomas showed the highest incidence (47%) followed by tumors of adipose tissue (19%) and those of peripheral nerves (12%). Rare tumors consisted of nodular fascitis, hibernoma, lipoblastomatosis, glomus tumor, granular cell tumor, and chondroma. The majority of cases in the malignant group were either those of muscle origin or blood vessel origin. Excepting for two cases of rhabdomyosarcoma of the embryonal type and two cases of angiosarcoma, all showed recurrence and/or metastasis and terminated in death. Three cases of liposarcoma of either well-differentiated or myxoid type had a good prognosis with all three living for 3 or more years without any recurrence. Other malignant tumors consisted of malignant schwannoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, and chordoma. The age, sex, anatomical location, and differential diagnosis have also been described.</str>

      <str>Retrorectal tumors (RRT) constitute an anatomical grouping of various tumors of different nature, both benign and malignant. The diversity of their presentation, surgical management, and prognosis are illustrated by five clinical cases. A simple categorization would distinguish vestigial tumors (whether cystic or solid), congenital nonvestigial tumors such as chordoma, and tumors of neural or bony origin. Imaging by CT scan and by MRI will usually determine the nature of the tumor and its relationship to the surrounding anatomical structures. The principle of treatment is complete removal with free margins. The surgical approach may be posterior, anterior or combined depending on the nature and the size of the lesion and on how high it is situated relative to the second sacral vertebra. Complete resection may be both difficult and bloody. Sacral segments may need to be resected either for reasons of surgical approach or to obtain clear margins. Rectal resection is rarely necessary. The prognosis of these lesions depends on the nature of the tumor and particularly on the quality and completeness of the resection.</str>

      <str>Background Chordomas are rare, locally aggressive neoplasms thought to arise from notochordal remnants in the axial skeleton. Primary intradural chordomas are considered to be extremely rare. In this article a giant intradural petroclival chordoma is presented, and a synthesis of the available literature is performed to measure overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and to identify prognostic factors. Methods A systematic Medline review yielded 47 patients with purely intradural tumors from 38 publications including 39 chordomas, 8 cases of ecchordosis physaliphora, and 1 case with features of both. The 5-year OS and RFS were calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for progression or mortality were analyzed using binomial logistic regression. Results Maximal tumor diameter varied from 1.5 to 6.0 cm (mean: 3.2 cm). Tumors were located predominantly in the prepontine area (66.7%). Combined 5-year Kaplan-Meier OS and RFS were 77% ± 11% and 74% ± 11%, respectively. Incomplete surgical resection, larger tumor diameter, and an elevated Ki-67 index were statistically more frequent in cases of recurrence and mortality. Conclusions Based on a systematic literature review, the behavior of primary intradural chordomas may be closer to typical chordomas than was previously thought. </str>

      <str>Fractionated proton beam radiotherapy has been used for skull base tumors in the United States since the mid-70s, and more than 300 patients in whom diagnosis of chordoma of the skull base has been made have been treated. The ability to achieve high degrees of radiation dose conformity by using protons has resulted in higher radiation doses than can be delivered with conventional radiotherapy in the base of skull. High target volume doses have led to improved tumor control and patient survival. Side effects such as severe toxicity are acceptable considering the alternatives of uncontrolled tumor growth. The authors of various analyses have identified prognostic factors that can be used to predict a patient's chance of treatment success. On the horizon are important technical developments that will further increase dose conformity and increase target doses. In this paper the author reviews long-term outcome data and prognostic predictors for survival of patients with skull base chordomas based on the largest worldwide patient series.</str>

      <str>The authors conducted a study of 22 skull base chordomas.</str>
      <str>A series of 22 skull base chordomas was analyzed with G banding. Subsequently, metaphase cells obtained from three tumors were reexamined using multicolor spectral karyotyping. Clonal chromosome aberrations were identified in 11 cases, all of which were recurrent tumors. Three tumors showed a remarkable similarity in cytogenetic features, and these features appear to characterize a recurring combination of nonrandom chromosome aberrations, including isochromosome 1q, gain of chromosome 7, and monosomy for chromosomes 3, 4, 10,13, and 18. Isochromosome 1q was identified as the sole recurring structural chromosome rearrangement in these tumors. The pattern of chromosome loss reported in the progression of lumbosacral chordoma also appears to be true of skull base chordomas with the additional findings of isochromosome 1q, gain of chromosome 7, and loss of chromosome 18.</str>

      <str>Chordomas can be categorized into those of clival, cervical and sacrococcygeal origin. The clival chordomas are primarily discussed in this report. In defining pathological anatomy or histology, a differentiation of benign from malignant chordomas by histological means alone is impossible. A preoperative diagnosis is only possible if tumor grows into the nasopharynx and allows a tissue biopsy to be taken. These tumors are clinically malignant though strict anatomic criteria for malignancy such as nuclear polymorphia or atypia, mitoses and metastases are rarely observed. The therapeutic results of operation and radiation are compared. Each alone fails because of the high recurrence rate of the tumor so that their combination is preferred. Although the prognosis of this disease is poor, one of our patients who was treated with radiation and surgery had a survival time of 14 years.</str>

Mean delay between the first clinical manifestations and the diagnosis is 22 months. Clinical findings are not specific. Roentgenologic findings show 2 typicals aspects: a lytic lesion on the lateral side of the vertebrae frequently involving more than one cervical vertebrae, a mixed lesion (lytic and sclerotic) or only sclerotic was detected only at the lumbar spine. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are the most useful investigations to determine the local extension of the tumor. Certitude of the diagnosis is always microscopic. Evolution is difficult to precise in this kind of embryological tumor. Radical surgery at the earliest time is the best guarantee of a better prognosis which still remain severe.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordomas containing a sarcomatous component are extremely rare. Here the authors report two new cases in which a recurrent tumor with a sarcomatous component appeared after the patient had undergone charged-particle radiotherapy. Histological examinations performed in Case 1 revealed some retention of epithelial features in the sarcomatous component, whereas no such regions were observed in Case 2. Both patients had rapidly deteriorating clinical courses and died within 6 months after diagnosis of the recurrent tumor. The authors discuss the significance of the histological subtypes of these tumors for long-term prognosis and their pathogenetic mechanisms in relation to radiotherapy. Although these sarcomatous transformations are rare in conventional chordomas, a careful histological examination and thorough follow-up imaging studies are crucial when treating patients with such lesions.</str>

      <str>Clinical, radiographic, and functional outcome parameters were analyzed before and after treatment of eight individuals with lumbosacral chordomas studied over a 3-year period. Emphasis was placed upon correlation of multiplane images and the pathoanatomy of the gross specimen. Surgical resections achieving wide margins can be curative. Magnetic resonance imaging of lumbosacral chordomas has revolutionized the preoperative anatomic localization of these tumors. Therefore, it is critical that the operating surgeon scrutinize the three-dimensional location of the tumor and its spatial relationship to surrounding structures prior to surgical eradication. A systematic approach for the radiographic analysis of tumor extent in lumbosacral chordomas is presented. Four strategic areas of preoperative analysis are identified for sacral chordomas and two for lumbar neoplasms. Functional outcome after resection is predicted by Stener's work. Contamination-free surgery is facilitated by accurate preoperative radiographic interpretation of the pathoanatomy by the surgeon.</str>

      <str>Spinal tumors consist of a large spectrum of various histologic entities. Multiple spinal lesions frequently represent known metastatic disease or lymphoproliferative disease. In solitary lesions primary neoplasms of the spine should be considered. Primary spinal tumors may arise from the spinal cord, the surrounding leptomeninges, or the extradural soft tissues and bony structures. A wide variety of benign neoplasms can involve the spine including enostosis, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, giant cell tumor, and osteochondroma. Common malignant primary neoplasms are chordoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and osteosarcoma. Although plain radiographs may be useful to characterize some spinal lesions, magnetic resonance imaging is indispensable to determine the extension and the relationship with the spinal canal and nerve roots, and thus determine the plan of management.

      <str>Tumors of the clivus, such as chordoma and chondrosarcoma, are generally amenable to an anterior surgical approach. However, approaches that traverse the pharynx or paranasal sinuses do not adequately expose tumor posterolateral to the horizontal course of the intrapetrous carotid artery. In addition, when tumor extends into the posterior fossa, supplemental exposure of neurovascular structures is necessary. A combination petrosectomy and subtemporal craniotomy can provide simultaneous access to the entire clivus as well as the lateral aspect of the midbrain, pons, and upper medulla. The extent of petrosectomy performed depends on a number of factors including status of hearing, facial nerve function, and degree of brainstem compression. In our experience with three patients (two chordomas and one chondrosarcoma), using either the retrolabyrinthine-subtemporal or transcochlear-subtemporal approach, excellent resection was achieved with acceptable morbidity considering the extensive nature of the disease.</str>

      <str>Due to the establishment in recent years of neuroendoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), it has become possible during ETV to observe the ventral brainstem surface--particularly the prepontine cistern--in a minimally invasive manner via the third ventricular base with a neuroendoscope. As an adaptation of that technique in this study, we investigated a neuroendoscopic trans-third ventricle approach (ETTVA), which accesses lesions of the ventral brainstem surface with a neuroendoscope inserted via the stoma of the third ventricular floor. Our study included 6 cases, including one case each of neurenteric cyst, chordoma, pontine glioma (astrocytoma), ecchordosis physaliphora, endodermal cyst, and cystic schwannoma. Surgical operations performed by ETTVA included 3 cases of tumor resection, 2 cases of tumor biopsy, and 1 case of cyst puncture and aspiration. There were no complications accompanying ETTVA. Out of the 6 cases, only 1 required additional surgical treatment following ETTVA surgery. In the other 5 cases, no additional surgical procedures were performed. This study showed that ETTVA allowed access to the prepontine cistern quickly and in a minimally invasive manner. In selected cases, ETTVA can offer a new approach to these lesions.</str>

      <str>A new optimization model is described and its clinical usefulness is demonstrated. The optimization technique was developed to allow computer optimization of 3-dimensional radiation therapy plans with biological models of tumor and normal tissue response to radiation as well as with scores based on physical dose. The emphasis was placed on the optimization model, which should describe, as closely as possible, the goal of the radiation treatment, which is eradication of the tumor while sparing normal tissues. Since the statement of the goals may vary from case to case, a technique that allows a variety of objective functions and types of constraints was developed. The optimization algorithm is capable of handling nonlinear and even discrete score (objective) functions and constraints and effectively explores the vast space of feasible solutions in a relatively short time (minutes of MicroVax 3200 CPU time). An example of computer optimization of radiation therapy of a chordoma of the sphenoid bone using x-ray and proton beams is shown and compared with the best plans achieved by an experienced planner. Directions for future development of the algorithm, allowing optimization of beam orientation, are presented.</str>

To the best of our knowledge, the MGMT promoter methylation status has not been studied in a population of patients with chordomas to determine if a biologic rationale exists to support the use of temozolomide. We here show for the first time that methylation of MGMT promoter is present in a significant portion or recurring clival chordomas; on the contrary in clival chordomas without recurrence MGMT promoter was always unmethylated (p = 0.0317). Although these observations need to be confirmed in a larger study population, our results (1) indicate that methylation of MGMT promoter is present in a significant portion of recurring chordomas, and (2) prompt further investigation into the potential role of temozolomide as an adjuvant treatment of these tumors.</str>

      <str>Lesions ventral and ventrolateral to the neuraxis at the CCJ can pose a significant management problem owing to their strategic location. Conventional direct posterior approaches sometimes may not allow adequate visualization of the entire tumor base without significant manipulation of the brain stem and spinal cord. Here, we describe an approach that allows safe access to a ventrolaterally extending chordoma originating from the second and third cervical vertebrae.</str>
      <str>A 31-year-old man was admitted to our institution with progressive motor weakness in his left arm and lower extremities and spastic gait disturbance. Neuroradiologic examination revealed an osseous tumor at the C2-3 level that presented with severe spinal cord compression and considerable bone destruction. We performed a resection of the tumor and posterior screw fixation from occiput to C5 using a conventional direct posterior approach. However, we were unable to reach a part of the tumor that extended far laterally to the left side with VA involvement. To expose and resect this remaining tumor, we used a far-lateral approach just posterior to the SCM muscle. Resecting the transverse processes of C2 and C3 and mobilizing the V2 segment of the VA adequately exposed the tumor for resection. After resection of the remaining posterior-lateral tumor, we closed and made the final approach anteriorly to resect the anterior tumor via an anterior corpectomy and fusion. No postoperative complications occurred, and the patient's neurologic status improved after surgery. He has had no craniocervical instability during the 2-year follow-up period.</str>
      <str>When a direct posterior approach makes it difficult or impossible to reach tumors extending to the far lateral margins of the spine and soft tissues, the posterior-lateral approach described here allows excellent visualization and safe access with minimal neural retraction for treating these laterally situated lesions.

      <str>We report a case of large clival chordoma. The patient was a 56-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital with left eye ptosis and diplopia of 2 months duration. On admission, neurological examinations revealed oculomotor nerve palsy of the left eye. Skull radiographs with polytomographs demonstrated marked destruction of the clivus. A plain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large iso-attenuated mass in the clivus, extending anteriorly into the sphenoidal sinus, superiorly into the suprasellar cistern, bilaterally into the petrous apex, posteriorly into the prepontine cistern and caudally into the foramen magnum. An enhanced CT scan demonstrated a slightly enhanced tumor. A high-resolution bone-window CT scan revealed marked destruction of the clivus and bilateral petrous apex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans disclosed a large enhanced mass extending superiorly into the suprasellar cistern, bilaterally into the petrous apex and inferiorly into the foramen magnum. The tumor extended so widely that we decided on a one-stage operation via a transsphenoidal sublabial transseptal approach and transoral transpalatal approach. At surgery, we employed a neuronavigator and Codman 4-mm rigid neuroendoscope with 0 degree, 30 degrees and 70 degrees angled lenses. The tumor was very soft and suckable, and could be easily removed by applying CUSA, a pituitary curette and suction. The neuronavigator was particularly useful because the surgeon had a real-time two-dimensional representation of the position of the tip of this device in the corresponding imaging space intraoperatively. The neuroendoscope also proved useful, since remnant tumor tissues that could not be seen under an operating microscope were frequently recognized near or around the entrance of the tumor cavity, cavernous sinus region and petroclival junction area. The surgeon was able to remove these remnants safely by checking on the neuroendoscope monitor. The tumor was excised completely. The dead space of the tumor cavity was reconstructed using a free rectus abdominis muscle flap. Postoperatively, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis were recognized, but improved following spinal drainage for one week and intrathecal injection of antibiotic. The oculomotor nerve palsy of the left eye also showed good recovery at one month after the operation. Recently, skull base surgery has undergone considerable developments. Neuroendoscopes and neuronavigators are very helpful for the neurosurgeon in performing skull base tumor surgery safely and with precision, although further instrument modifications are needed.</str>

      <str>To find the causes of the spinal primary tumors recurrence in surgical technique.</str>
      <str>From 1989 to 2002, 38 cases of primary spine tumors, including giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma, chondrosarcoma and chordoma with wide resection via a piece-meal fashion. By adopting a retrospective method, the present study investigated the clinical and imaging materials of pre- and post-operation period and those in follow-up.</str>
      <str>The study included 18 cases of giant cell tumor, 6 osteoblastoma, 6 chondrosarcoma and 8 chordoma. In all cases, 63% of tumors were in cervical and cervicothoracic (C(7)-T(2)) spine; 29% in thoracolumbar (T(4)-L(5)) spine and 8% in sacrum. Tumors involved in multi-segment were 34%. And 71% patients had the tumor in the body and the arch simultaneously. And 71% of tumors formed paraspinal masses, 42% in both sides. The tumors invaded the channel in 58% of the cases. The compartment were invaded in 79% patients. Finally, 32 patients were followed up, from 1.0 approximately 14.9 years, 5.1 years average. Seventeen patients recurred after the surgery, the recurrence rate was 53%. The recurrence rate of giant cell tumor was 35%, osteoblastoma 50%, chondrosarcoma 75%, chordoma 100%. The recurrence rate of tumor in cervical and cervicothoracic spine was 63%, thoracic-lumbar 33%, sacrum 67%. The recurrence rate of multi-segment tumors was 80%, and that of single segment 41%. The recurrence rate of the tumors involving in vertebral body alone or involving the arch simultaneously reached 75% and 55% respectively; the recurrent rate in the arch alone was 33%. The recurrence rate of the tumors involving in vertebral body ranged in different segments. Those growing in cervical and cervicothoracic spine reached 73%; those growing in thoracolumbar spine was only 25%. The recurrence of the tumors without soft masses was 20%, those of single-sided soft masses was 45% and those of double-sided 91%. Among the 17 recurrent patients, 83% of the tumors were in the cervical and cervicothoracic spine. Those extending to the upper cervical and cervicothoracic amounted to 58%. All the 17 recurrent patients had body lesion and paraspinal soft masses.</str>
      <str>During the primary spinal tumor operation, that failure to get adequate exposure and full division is thought to be the cause of recurrence. So the precise design before surgery and adequate exposure of the tumor in the surgery is the guarantee of wide excision.</str>

      <str>To asses carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) performed as re-irradiation in 28 patients with recurrent tumors.</str>
      <str>Twenty-eight patients were treated with carbon ion RT as re-irradiation for recurrent chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base (n=16 and n=2), one chordoma and one chondrosarcoma of the os sacrum, high-risk meningioma (n=3), adenoid-cystic carcinoma (n=4) as well as one SCCHN. All patients were treated using active raster scanning, and treatment planning was performed on CT- and MRI-basis. All patients were followed prospectively during follow-up.</str>
      <str>In all patients re-irradiation could be applied safely without interruptions. For skull base tumors, local tumor control after re-irradiation was 92% at 24 months and 64% at 36 months. Survival after re-irradiation was 86% at 24 months, and 43% at 60 months. In all three meningiomas treated with C12 for re-irradiation, the tumor recurrence was located within the former RT-field. Two patients developed tumor progression at 6 months, and in one patient the tumor remained stable for 67 months. In patients with head-and-neck tumors, three patients developed local tumor progression at 12, 24 and 29 months after re-irradiation. Median local progression-free survival was 24 months. For sacral tumors, re-irradiation offered palliation with tumor control for 24 and 36 months.</str>
      <str>Due to the physical characteristics particle therapy offers a new treatment modality in cases with tumor recurrences. With carbon ions, the additional biological benefits may be exploited for long-term tumor control. Further evaluation in a larger patients' cohort will be performed in the future.</str>

      <str>Brachyury plays a key role in mesoderm formation during vertebrate development. Absence of the gene results in loss of posterior mesoderm and failure of the notochord to differentiate, while misexpression of Brachyury in the prospective ectoderm of Xenopus results in ectopic mesoderm formation. Brachyury is therefore both necessary and sufficient for posterior mesoderm formation. Here we present a detailed cellular and molecular analysis of the consequences of inhibiting Brachyury function during Xenopus development. Our results show that Brachyury is required for the convergent extension movements of gastrulation, for mesoderm differentiation in response to FGF, and for the survival of posterior mesodermal cells in both Xenopus and mouse.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas pose management challenges owing to their critical location, locally aggressive nature, and high recurrence rate despite multimodality treatment. We used stereotactic radiosurgery as primary or adjuvant therapy to achieve safe and effective therapeutic irradiation.</str>
      <str>At an average of 4 years (range 1-7), we evaluated 15 patients (nine with chordomas and six with chondrosarcomas) who had gamma-knife radiosurgery as an adjunct (13 patients) or as an alternative to microsurgical resection (two patients). Patient age varied from 7 to 70 years (mean 38). There was a distinct male preponderance (2:1). Thirteen patients had undergone between one and four resections. Using conformal radiosurgical planning, a maximum tumor dose of 24-40 Gy (mean 36) and a tumor margin dose of 12-20 Gy (mean 18) was given to a mean tumor volume of 4.6 ml.</str>
      <str>Eight patients showed clinical improvement, three remained stable, and four died. Two of the four patients who died had tumor progression remote from the radiosurgery volume; two patients died of unrelated disorders. Among 11 surviving patients, follow-up imaging showed a reduction in tumor size in five, no further tumor growth in five, and an increase in the size of the tumor in one. The patient with further tumor growth after radiosurgery subsequently underwent repeat resection.</str>
      <str>Despite the formidable management challenge posed by these neoplasms, our long-term evaluation has shown that radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for patients with small volume tumors.</str>

      <str>"Chondroid chordoma" is a controversial and confusing entity that was originally described by Heffelfinger and colleagues as a biphasic malignant neoplasm possessing elements of both chordoma and cartilaginous tissue. Because the premise for this distinction was based strictly on histomorphologic criteria, the light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features of the chondroid and chordoid areas of five chondroid chordomas of the skull base were evaluated separately, and compared to five typical chordomas and six low grade chondrosarcomas. Using light microscopy, chondroid chordoma revealed areas that resembled typical chordoma (chordoid areas) and areas that resembled low grade chondrosarcoma (chondroid areas). However, both the chordoid and chondroid areas had an epithelial phenotype and stained strongly for cytokeratin and EMA as well as S-100. 5'-nucleotidase, an enzyme that has been described in chordoma but not in chondrosarcoma, was found in both the chordoid and chondroid areas of one chondroid chordoma. Electron microscopic studies of both the chordoid and chondroid areas in four of the tumors demonstrated both tonofibrils and desmosomes. Chordoma demonstrated immunohistochemical and electron microscopic features that were nearly identical to chondroid chordoma. Chordoma was cytokeratin, EMA, S-100, and 5'-nucleotidase positive. Ultrastructurally, chordoma exhibited variably-sized vacuoles, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and desmosomes with tonofilaments. In contrast to chondroid chordoma, chondrosarcoma consistently stained for only S-100 protein and was cytokeratin, EMA and 5'-nucleotidase negative. Ultrastructurally, chondrosarcoma demonstrated a flocculogranular matrix, glycogen, abundant RER, and scalloped cellular outlines, but lacked desmosomes with tonofilaments. These findings indicate that "chondroid chordoma" is a variant of chordoma with histologic features that may mimic chondrosarcoma. Despite the resemblance of these hyalinized areas to cartilaginous tissue, these tumors retain their epithelial phenotype. Biphasic differentiation is not present. These findings undermine the original premise for distinguishing "chondroid chordoma" from typical chordoma. The authors propose that these tumors be classified as "hyalinized chordomas," rather than "chondroid chordoma," to clarify their histogenesis and avoid confusion with chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull.</str>

      <str>Exogenous application of BMP to the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) of chick embryos at the early somite stage had a positive effect on Nodal expression. BMP applications into the right LPM were followed by a rapid activation of Nodal, while applications into the left LPM resulted in expansion of the normal domain of Nodal expression. Conversely, blocking of BMP signaling by Noggin in the left LPM interfered with the activation of Nodal expression. These results support a positive role for endogenous BMP on Nodal expression in the LPM. We also report that BMP positively regulates the expression of Caronte, Snail and Cfc in both the left and right LPM. BMP-treated embryos had molecular impairment of the midline with downregulation of Lefty1, Brachyury and Shh but we also show that the midline defect was not sufficient to induce ectopic Nodal expression. We discuss our findings in the context of the known molecular control of the specification of left-right asymmetry.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors that arise from the remnants of the notochord. Because of their deep location, local infiltrative nature, and involvement of surrounding bone, treatment of chordomas is a challenge. In this study the authors analyze the data and prognostic factors obtained during the follow-up period (range 1-150 months, median 38 months) in 53 patients with craniocervical junction chordomas and 10 patients with chondrosarcomas.</str>
      <str>Several surgical approaches were used, and some tumor excisions required staged procedures. Survival was calculated according the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact, log rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Radical/subtotal resection was achieved in 77.8% of the patients. The mortality rate during the follow-up period was 14.3%. In patients harboring chondrosarcoma better 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were demonstrated than in those with chordoma (100% and 50.7%. respectively). Histological patterns (typical or chondroid chordomas) and patient age at onset of symptoms had no effect on the RFS rates. Radical/subtotal resections were associated with better RFS rates than partial resection. Adjuvant proton-beam therapy was shown to increase the RFS rates compared with conventional radiotherapy (90.9% and 19.4%, respectively, at 4 years posttreatment). Karyotypically abnormal tumors were associated with the worst RFS rates compared with karyotypically normal lesions (44.5% and 90.3%, respectively, at 3 years). Cases of cranial nerve palsy followed by those with cerebrospinal fluid leakages were the most frequent postoperative complications. Permanent postoperative neurological deficit was observed in 28.6% of the patients.</str>
      <str>A better prognosis was observed in patients with chondrosarcoma compared with those harboring chordoma. Histological pattern and patient age at symptom onset were not factors that influenced prognosis in cases of chordoma. Extensive resection and possibly adjuvant proton-beam therapy provided better prognoses for these patients.</str>

      <str>Rarity of the disease has limited the number of population-based studies addressing the issues of prognostic factors and the current treatment outcomes.</str>
      <str>A total of 962 patients with chordoma, diagnosed between 1973 and 2005, were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics, incidence, year of diagnosis, location, size and stage at diagnosis, treatment(s), and survival were extracted. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression were used to analyze the significance of prognostic factors.</str>
      <str>Race specific incidence per 100,000 persons in 2005 shows whites to have the highest (0.473) incidence, followed by Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.091), and Afro-Americans (zero), respectively. The incidence difference between whites and Afro-Americans over time is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). The age adjusted incidence reveals a peak in eighth decade of life. Survival was not impacted by race. Age category &lt;59, Hispanic ethnicity, size &lt;8 cm, and surgical resection were all independent predictors of better overall survival. Analysis revealed that survival outcomes were very similar in patients with "in-operable disease" and those in which "surgery was recommended but not performed" suggesting that benefits of resection cannot be solely attributed to selection bias.</str>
      <str>With high local recurrence rates and the significant functional morbidity associated with surgical resections, clinicians are left wondering if surgery constitutes an appropriate treatment option. Our study clearly demonstrates that surgery significantly improves the overall survival for patients with chordoma.

      <str>The 3T MRI suite is built adjacent to the neurosurgical operation theatre. The magnet room and the operation theatre are interconnected by a door and both RF-shielded. Before the operation, the magnet (3T Trio, Siemens) and the console rooms are disinfected.

Axial, sagittal and/or coronal TSE T2, SE T1 and 3D Flash T1 weighted images (4-6 mm section thickness, 1 mm interslice gap) are obtained according to the lesion. Total examination time is approximately 10 minutes.</str>
      <str>Twenty-six patients were examined with ioMR. There were ten female and seven male patients. Lesions were pituitary adenoma in 10, low grade glial tumor in 9, meningioma and high grade glial tumor in 2 each and metastasis, haemangioblastoma and chordoma in one each. Follow-up time was 1 to 9 months. In 16 patients the first intraoperative examination revealed gross total tumor excision. However, in 10 patients due to tumor remnants surgical intervention was continued and a second examination revealed gross total tumor excision in all. Postoperative routine MR examinations confirmed total tumor excision in all patients. No complication occurred in this series.</str>

The purpose of this study was to assess expressions of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 in skull base chordomas and to find out their correlations to outcome. Immunohistochemical study was performed in 19 samples (initial, n = 11; recurrent, n = 8) from 11 patients. The correlations among expression of RECK, MMP-2, MMP-9, and their prognostic values were analyzed. Significant correlation between RECK and MMP-9 was found, but there was no correlation found between MMP-2 and MMP-9. Higher MMP-9 expression significantly influenced outcome. Furthermore, MMP-9/RECK ratio showed significant correlation to outcome, showing their inverse relationship in the disease progress of skull base chordoma.

      <str>The mouse T (Brachyury) deletion causes defective mesoderm formation and notochord morphogenesis, and abnormalities in the caudal neural tube and somites. To investigate the effect of the wild type T gene on concurrently expressed genes, we have compared expression of a panel of such genes in homozygous T mutants with that in wild type and heterozygous T/+ control embryos. Two classes of genes were used in this study: those implicated in primitive streak or mesoderm formation, and those which are differentially expressed in regions of the neural tube and somites. Results of wholemount in situ analysis show that the mRNA levels of Evx-1, Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a decrease in T/T embryos late in gastrulation, although earlier expression patterns are similar to control embryos. In contrast, BMP-4 and Msx-1 expression patterns remain similar throughout the period studied. Pax-3 and Pax-6, which are expressed in specific dorsoventral domains of the neural tube, both have ventrally extended expression domains in caudal T/T neural tube. This is consistent with a missing ventral signal provided by the notochord. However, the expression of Msx-1 in the most dorsal domain of the neural tube is unaltered in T/T embryos. Pax-1 and Pax-3, which are expressed in the sclerotome and dermamyotome respectively, are expressed correctly in anterior T/T somites, although the Pax-3 expression domain is widened ventromedially. This extension into ventromedial somite domains is more pronounced caudally, supporting a function for the notochord in ventralizing somites.</str>

      <str>Androgens regulate biological pathways to promote proliferation, differentiation, and survival of benign and malignant prostate tissue. Androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies exploit this dependence and are used in advanced prostate cancer to control disease progression. Contemporary treatment regimens involve sequential use of inhibitors of androgen synthesis or AR function. Although targeting the androgen axis has clear therapeutic benefit, its effectiveness is temporary, as prostate tumor cells adapt to survive and grow. The removal of androgens (androgen deprivation) has been shown to activate both epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD) programs. EMT has established roles in promoting biological phenotypes associated with tumor progression (migration/invasion, tumor cell survival, cancer stem cell-like properties, resistance to radiation and chemotherapy) in multiple human cancer types. NEtD in prostate cancer is associated with resistance to therapy, visceral metastasis, and aggressive disease. Thus, activation of these programs via inhibition of the androgen axis provides a mechanism by which tumor cells can adapt to promote disease recurrence and progression. Brachyury, Axl, MEK, and Aurora kinase A are molecular drivers of these programs, and inhibitors are currently in clinical trials to determine therapeutic applications. Understanding tumor cell plasticity will be important in further defining the rational use of androgen-targeted therapies clinically and provides an opportunity for intervention to prolong survival of men with metastatic prostate cancer. </str>

      <str>Myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE) is a rare variant of conventional ependymoma found predominantly in the sacrococcygeal region in young adults and characterized by its distinct epithelial and stromal components (WHO grade I designation). MPE with extensive osteolysis is extremely uncommon and only up to 40 cases have been documented. A case is presented here in which imprint smears of a sacral tumor in an 18-year-old man revealed complex papillary structures, small loose clusters, or cord-like structures of bland tumor cells embedded in a myxoid or mucinous background. The tumor cells possessed uniformly round nuclei with a smooth nuclear outline, fine granular chromatin, and small nucleoli. Slender cytoplasmic fibrillary processes and occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles were observed. A cytologic diagnosis of a MPE was suggested and histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were conducted on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed diffuse and strong membranous and cytoplasmic staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, glial fibrillary protein, and S-100 protein, but negative for epithelial membrane antigen, pan-neuroendocrine markers (i.e., NSE, chromogranin A, synaptophysin), or brachyury. The proliferative index with MIB-1 was around 10%. The diagnosis of osteolytic MPE was confirmed based on cytopathologic, histopathological, immunohistochemical results, radiologic findings, and the location of the tumor. We demonstrated here the cytopathological features of osteolytic MPE with emphasis on differential diagnostic considerations.</str>

      <str>RNA-binding protein TIAR has been suggested to mediate the translational silencing of ARE-containing mRNAs. To analyze the functions of TIAR, we established RNAi and genetic rescue assays. We evaluated the expression of neuroectoderm markers Pax6 and nestin, mesoderm markers brachyury and Flk1, and hypoblast and definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and Gata6 during EB differentiation and found that knockdown TIAR expression restrained the differentiation of E14 cells. We assessed gene expression levels of Flk-1 and VE-cadherin and observed attenuated differentiation of E14 cells into endothelial cells upon downregulation of TIAR gene expression. As such, we hypothesized an essential role of TIAR related to EB differentiation. As TIAR inhibits the translation of c-myc, we proposed that downregulation of TIAR results in restrained differentiation of E14 cells, due in part to the function of c-myc. We found that TIAR inhibited c-myc expression at the translational level in E14 cells; accordingly, a reduction of TIAR expression promoted self-renewal of pluripotent cells and attenuated differentiation. Additionally, we established that TIAR inhibited TIA-1 expression at the translational level in E14 cells. Taken together, we have contributed to the understanding of the regulatory relationships between TIAR and both c-myc and TIA-1. </str>

Strong expression of Xbra messenger RNA is found in the ring of involuting mesoderm during Xenopus gastrulation, and the expression of Xbra is an immediate-early response of animal pole blastomeres to mesoderm-inducing factors. To assess the role of Xbra in mesoderm formation, we increased its domain of expression in the embryo by microinjection of Xbra transcripts into the animal pole of Xenopus embryos at the one-cell stage. We show that expression of Xbra by cells of the early embryo is sufficient to direct their development into differentiated mesodermal tissues. At the molecular level this response shows a sharp threshold of sensitivity to the dose of Xbra RNA delivered, and we suggest that Xbra may act as a genetic switch initiating posterior mesodermal specification during embryogenesis.</str>

However, in the caudal lateral epiblast (CLE) where axial stem cells reside, Sox2 and Sox3 are expressed at low levels, together with Brachyury. Because axial stem cells are the bipotential precursors of the neural plate and paraxial mesoderm, we investigated the possibility that low-level B1 Sox expression in CLE may regulate the fate of axial stem cells. We combined the genetic conditions of Sox3-null and Sox2 N1 enhancer homozygous deletion (Sox2(ΔN1/ΔN1)) to decrease B1 Sox expression in CLE. At 5-7 somite stages of mouse embryogenesis, these genetic manipulations caused approximately 30% higher production of paraxial mesodermal precursors, resulting in the development of larger somites. Analysis of mitotic cell populations suggested that decrease of B1 Sox expression in CLE does not activate cell proliferation but promotes cell migration into the mesodermal compartment. Thus, the low-level B1 Sox expression in CLE regulates axial stem cells to adjust the production of paraxial mesoderm precursors to an appropriate level. </str>

      <str>Vertebrate wnt8a links anteroposterior and dorsoventral axis patterning, but the regulation of wnt8a expression and its relationship to mesoderm induction and maintenance pathways is unclear. To address this, we have generated zebrafish transgenic for a modified genomic PAC clone that expresses EGFP from the wnt8a locus. The EGFP reporter transgene is expressed in a pattern nearly identical to wnt8a, including maternal deposition, expression in the ventrolateral mesoderm and in the yolk syncytial layer. Loss of function studies show that wnt8a expression is under biphasic control by Nodal and No Tail/Brachyury, whereby early phase expression is Nodal-dependent but late phase expression is Ntl/Bra dependent. EGFP fluorescence persists in cells that transcribe the reporter, thus comprising a tracer for ventrolaterally derived mesodermal lineages. We use this property to show that wnt8a expression marks Nodal-independent tail mesoderm formation and that Ntl/Bra predominantly regulates wnt8a in paraxial mesoderm progenitors.</str>

      <str>The Bone Tumor Registry of Westphalia contains data on 7,400 tumors and tumor-like lesions of bone, 135 primary spinal tumors, 187 metastases, 98 plasmacytomas, 4 extranodal manifestations of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the vertebral column. The most frequent type of primary tumor is the chordoma (35 cases), followed by osteoblastoma (16 cases), eosinophil granuloma (16), and hemangioma (12 cases). Most of the metastases derive from carcinoma of the breast, bronchial carcinoma, or prostate carcinoma. The present review concentrates on differential diagnosis by means of histological examination, with particular reference to immunohistological methods. In addition, the necessity for complementary assessment of the X-ray findings and histology is emphasized. In particular, the current status of knowledge on the prognosis of primary spinal tumors is presented. In our experience, the preparation of nondecalcified plastic sections has proved especially valuable for diagnostic procedures using punch biopsy specimens.</str>

      <str>Parachordoma is a tumor that was established and described by Laskowski in 1951. It is a rare tumor, which appears adjacent to tendons, synovium, and even osseous structures. It is lobular and pseudoencapsulated. Histologically, in some ways, it is compatible with the chordomas of bone with a constant fibrous tissue component. It grows slowly and is only locally invasive. If not adequately excised, it is prone to recur, but complete surgical removal is usually possible. Its exact histogenesis remains obscure. This tumor may have some relationship to the great vesicular cells of chordoid tissue described by Schaffer as "blasige Zellen von chordoiden Gewebe" developing from special synovial cells.

The patient manifested seizures as the initial symptom and subsequently exhibited subclinical microcytic hypochromic anemia. The tumor, located in the falcotentorial region and associated with diffuse edema, was totally resected. On histological examination of the surgical specimen, the clustering pattern of partly vacuolated cells in the mucoid stroma mimicked chordoma; however, positive staining of individual cells for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen led to a diagnosis of meningioma. Interestingly, the tumor cells were surrounded by a periodic acid-Schiff- and type IV collagen-positive substance. Electron microscopy demonstrated a strikingly dense and thick basal lamina. The patient's microcytic hypochromic anemia disappeared after the tumor was removed.

A petroclival chordoma growing laterally in the skull base is one of the most challenging tumors for neurosurgeons. We have treated petroclival chordomas based on the principle of maximal surgical resection of the tumor with minimal morbidity. Lateral skull base approaches were used to approach petroclival chordomas in eight patients. The surgical procedure involved removal of soft tumor tissue and extensive drilling of adjacent bony structures. Gross total resection of the tumor was achieved in six patients. Subtotal resection in the remaining two patients was associated with acceptable morbidity. In cases of petroclival chordomas, lateral skull base approaches can be used as a primary procedure, although those approaches may be associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.</str>

      <str>ADAM19 is a member of the meltrin subfamily of ADAM metalloproteases. In Xenopus, ADAM19 is present as a maternal transcript. Zygotic expression starts during gastrulation and is apparent in the dorsal blastopore lip. ADAM19 expression through neurulation and tailbud formation becomes enriched in dorsal structures such as the neural tube, the notochord and the somites. Using morpholino knock-down, we show that a reduction of ADAM19 protein in gastrula stage embryos results in a decrease of Brachyury expression in the notochord concomitant with an increase in the dorsal markers, Goosecoid and Chordin. These changes in gene expression are accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylated AKT, a downstream target of the EGF signaling pathway, and occur while the blastopore closes at the same rate as the control embryos. During neurulation and tailbud formation, ADAM19 knock-down induces a reduction of the neural markers N-tubulin and NRP1 but not Sox2. In the somitic mesoderm, the expression of MLC is also decreased while MyoD is not. ADAM19 knockdown also reduces neural crest markers prior to cell migration. Neural crest induction is also decreased in embryos treated with an EGF receptor inhibitor suggesting that this pathway is necessary for neural crest cell induction. Using targeted knock-down of ADAM19 we show that the reduction of neural and neural crest markers is cell autonomous and that the migration if the cranial neural crest is perturbed. We further show that ADAM19 protein reduction affects somite organization, reduces 12-101 expression and perturbs fibronectin localization at the intersomitic boundary.</str>

      <str>During heart development at the gastrula stage, inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity affects the heart specification but does not impair the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA), which is first expressed in the heart mesoderm and recruited into initial heart myofibrils. Interaction of tissues between posterior epiblast and hypoblast at the early blastula stage is necessary to induce the expression of SMA, in which Nodal and Chordin are thought to be involved. Here we investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8) in the expression of SMA. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that Fgf8b is expressed predominantly in the nascent hypoblast. Anti-FGF8b antibody inhibited the expression of SMA, cTNT, and Tbx5, which are BMP-independent heart mesoderm/early cardiomyocyte genes, but not Brachyury in cultured posterior blastoderm, and combined FGF8b and Nodal, but neither factor alone induced the expression of SMA in association with heart specific markers in cultured epiblast. Although FGF8b did not induce the upregulation of phospho-Smad2, anti-FGF8b properties suppressed phospho-Smad2 in cultured blastoderm. FGF8b was able to reverse the BMP-induced inhibition of cardiomyogenesis. The results suggest that FGF8b acts on the epiblast synergistically with Nodal at the pregastrula stage and may play a role in the expression of SMA during early cardiogenesis.</str>

      <str>Except for clear cell carcinomas that metastasize to bone, with renal cell carcinoma being the principal representative of that group, clear cell osseous neoplasms are rare. The only distinct nosologic entity in this category that is primary in the bone is the clear cell chondrosarcoma (CCCS). This lesion, which is most often seen in the proximal femur or humerus, affects males more often than females and has a peak incidence during the third and fourth decades of life. Radiologic images of CCCS show a well-circumscribed, often calcified lytic lesion that may expand the bone, but only uncommonly breaches the cortex. Clear cell elements in CCCS are accompanied by "conventional" foci of chondrosarcoma in less than 50% of cases; noncartilaginous "secondary features," including areas of osteogenesis, osteoclast-like giant cells, and zones resembling aneurysmal bone cyst or giant cell tumor of bone, may be apparent as well. CCCS is a relatively indolent malignancy; roughly 25% of patients experience local recurrences of their tumors or suffer metastasis, but tumor-related death is uncommon, particularly when the lesion has been completely resected en bloc. Sporadic examples of other tumors in bone also may be focally or entirely composed of clear cells. These include osteosarcoma, chondroblastoma, chordoma, adamantinoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. The last two of these lesions represent the most common primary clear cell bone tumors in children, whereas metastatic renal clear cell sarcoma is the most frequent metastatic pediatric tumor in this category.</str>

      <str>Description of surgical technique and retrospective review of 13 cases.</str>
      <str>To describe the surgical technique of margin-free spondylectomy and the outcome of 13 cases and to discuss the advantages and limitations of the procedure.</str>
      <str>Recently, spondylectomy became a standard procedure by several pioneers. For extended malignant spine tumors involving pedicles or epidural space, however, performing an "en bloc" resection with a tumor-free margin remains a challenge.</str>
      <str>Our procedure consists of a combined anterior and posterior procedure with one or two stages. In the anterior procedure, tumor vertebrae are covered by the pleura or psoas muscles as a barrier. The posterior procedure includes decompression through the intact posterior elements, coverage of the tumor with all possible soft tissue barriers, and en bloc extirpation by rotating the tumor vertebrae around the spinal cord. We performed this procedure in 13 cases: 3 chondrosarcoma, 3 giant cell tumor, 1 osteosarcoma, 1 chordoma, and 5 metastases.</str>
      <str>Neurologic status and pain improved in all cases except asymptomatic cases. There was no local recurrence, except in 2 cases (chondrosarcoma with extirpation of 5 vertebrae, chordoma with multiple previous surgeries). Two cases of chondrosarcoma were disease-free 14 years and 13 years after surgery, respectively.</str>
      <str>Although the best chance for a cure in extended malignant tumors of the spine is realized through wide resection, the procedure is not yet standardized. Margin-free spondylectomy is technically demanding, but the procedure can be used with a confidence as a more radical surgery for tumors extending to the epidural space and the unilateral pedicle. A key to success is the surgical technique, including a 360 degree dissection around the tumor vertebrae, instrumentation, and removal of the lesion with all possible soft tissues maintained intact to function as a barrier, like the dura mater.</str>

      <str>Twenty-seven patients with tumor-related secondary facial pain were treated by stereotactic radiosurgical procedures between November 1991 and October 1998. They had 14 meningiomas, 11 schwannomas (one trigeminal, 10 vestibular), one nasopharyngeal cancer and one chordoma. The mean maximum dose administered was 26.4 Gy (range 16 to 35 Gy) and the margin of the tumor was encompassed within the 45 to 90% isodose. The patients were analyzed based on their pain relief with a mean follow-up duration of 32.1 months. In 24 patients (85.7%), there was initial pain improvement after radiosurgery, but half had recurrent pain. A pain response was obtained in 12 cases (pain response rate = 42.9%), five were pain free and seven had pain reduction. On the follow-up MRI, a decrease in tumor volume of more than 20% of the preoperative volume occurred in 14 of 25 cases. The mean time interval to initial pain improvement (10.3 months) and pain response (5.7 months) were shorter than for a decrease in tumor volume (18.6 months). Tumor-related secondary facial pain was less responsive to stereotactic radiosurgery than idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. It would seem that the mechanism of pain relief in radiosurgery is not only trigeminal root decompression secondary to tumor volume reduction, but also other mechanisms involving inactivation of abnormal electrical transmission may be involved.</str>

      <str>Twenty cases of a rare tumor, chordoma involving the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or nasopharynx, are reported. Patients most often had localized headache, nasal obstruction, decreased hearing, or symptoms related to cranial nerve involvement, especially diplopia. A mass bulging into the nasopharynx, posterior nasal cavity, or pharynx was found on physical examination in 13 of these 20 patients, and in another 6 patients on radiologic examination. Paralysis of one or more cranial nerves was identified in the majority of patients who had tumors involving the upper nasopharynx. On radiologic examination, bone destruction was frequently identified in the clivus and sphenoid areas, and less commonly in the cervical vertebrae. Each patient had biopsy-proven tumor in the nasopharynx or sphenoid areas. Patients usually were treated by combinations of surgery and radiotherapy, in some cases leading to prolonged periods of apparent tumor control. Radiotherapy frequently resulted in regression of symptoms, sometimes lasting many months or years. A few tumors that involved mainly the lower nasopharynx were more amenable to surgical resection, in one case leading to apparent tumor control. In those cases with adequate follow-up information, most patients had either died of their disease or were living with recurrent or persistent inoperable tumor. Some patients lived for many months or years between recurrences or with known tumor, indicating that chordomas often are slowly growing neoplasms. The histologic features of these chordomas are described and illustrated, and the histopathologic differential diagnosis is discussed.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, locally aggressive malignancies that often exhibit an insidious natural history and are difficult to eradicate. Surgery and radiotherapy are the treatment mainstays of chordoma, but the chance of local recurrence remains high. Patients who relapse or cannot undergo a complete en bloc resection generally have a poor prognosis. New agents for postoperative adjuvant treatment of chordomas are needed.</str>
      <str>To highlight potential clinical trials that could evolve from new insights into the molecular biology of chordoma.</str>
      <str>We performed a review of recent studies published in the literature that have begun to characterize the molecular features of chordoma, and with this knowledge, several targets for potential clinical therapies have been determined.</str>
      <str>Several receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling cascades show dysregulation in chordoma and represent attractive targets for future therapeutic interventions. The pathways shown to be of particular importance in chordoma involve the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and common downstream cascade of phosphoinositide 3-kinases, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin.</str>
      <str>Recent findings characterizing the molecular biology of chordoma have illuminated multiple possible targets for future clinical trials. The availability of inhibitors against these aberrant pathways makes clinical trials with chordoma both feasible and immediately realizable.

      <str>A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented with otalgia, dysarthria, and weight loss. Neurological examination revealed palatal hypomotility, and weakness of the facial and tongue muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated the presence of a soft tissue mass in the clivus. Histologic examination of resected tumor disclosed well-differentiated thyroid follicles that invaded the local osseous tissues. Physical examination and radioiodine images of the thyroid gland were normal. The serum thyroglobulin concentration was markedly elevated (1011 ng/mL). A 0.9-cm well-differentiated benign-appearing left thyroid lobe follicular neoplasm with a thick fibrous capsule was found following diagnostic thyroidectomy. This report illustrates that clinically significant distant metastases can arise from occult follicular thyroid neoplasms that, according to standard histologic criteria, are benign. The presence of a thick fibrous capsule, even in the absence of vascular or capsular invasion, may identify follicular neoplasms that have metastatic potential.</str>

      <str>This study reviewed the value of cytogenetic information for the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in patients with skull base tumors.</str>
      <str>Chromosomal aberrations can be tumor-specific or nonspecific, and may often show complex karyotypes with numerous chromosomal deletions and gains. These changes may derive from a step-wise genetic transformation commonly seen in these tumors. Most chromosomal abnormalities of skull base carcinomas involve several clones with complex karyotypes. Chromosomal aberrations found in squamous cell carcinoma and salivary gland carcinomas of the skull base involve similar breakpoints to those found in the carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx and nasopharynx. Complex karyotype is the hallmark of chordoma, esthesioneuroblastoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the cranial base. In contrast, specific chromosomal translocations are characteristic for Ewing's sarcoma (11;22) and synovial sarcoma (X;18) of the skull base. Olfactory groove meningioma is characterized by breakpoint of chromosome arm 22q11.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors derived from notochordal remnants. The authors report on a series of three cases of primary familial oronasopharyngeal chordomas treated at our institution.</str>
      <str>A retrospective chart review was completed of the three cases of primary familial oronasopharyngeal chordoma treated at the University of Utah.</str>
      <str>All three patients (100%) were neurologically intact and presented with nasal obstruction. The patients ranged in age from 5 to 65 years and were first-degree relatives. None of the patients had bony erosion of the skull base on imaging, and all of the patients' tumors connected with the skull base via a tract. All three patients were treated with a wide excision combined with drilling of the involved skull base. They all tolerated the procedure without any complications and remain tumor free with a follow-up of 12 months to 4.5 years.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the role of chemotherapy in the treatment, management and outcome of children diagnosed with clival chordomas. The medical records of six pediatric chordoma patients diagnosed at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles between 1995 and 2005 were reviewed. Of the six patients reviewed, all underwent an initial surgical resection. Following resection, three received a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, two received chemotherapy alone and one patient refused both forms of therapy; this patient expired of progressive tumor. One patient developed acute monoblastic leukemia (M5a subtype) and died of intracranial hemorrhage during induction chemotherapy, 39 months after initial diagnosis. MRI of brain and spine showed disease progression shortly before his death. Two patients who received chemotherapy only after surgery, one patient who received chemotherapy at relapse following irradiation and one patient who received irradiation followed by chemotherapy are alive with stable radiographic abnormalities at a median follow-up of 9 years from diagnosis (range: 6-13 years). Chemotherapeutic agents included ifosfamide and etoposide in all four surviving patients. Chemotherapy with ifosfamide and etoposide may have a role in the treatment of pediatric clival chordomas when used alone or in combination with irradiation.</str>

      <str>Primary malignant bone neoplasms are relatively rare. The most common bone tumors are osteosarcoma,Ewing's sarcoma,chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma,malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone, giant cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst and chordoma. These tumors are generally considered to be a radioresistant entities, but it has been suggested that radiotherapy may be effective in a palliative and in some curative situations, if a sufficient dose is given to an adequate volume. Only for the management of primary Ewing's sarcoma the radiation therapy is an essential part in the multimodal therapy concept. The most common bone neoplasms and the role of the radiotherapy are discussed in these chapter.</str>

      <str>Myxoid variant of adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are rare, there being only 11 cases in the literature to date. Reported herein are the findings of a case, which in contrast to all previously reported myxoid ACC, was devoid of typical non-myxoid areas. The patient was a 61-year-old man in whom a left adrenal mass was detected during investigation of Cushing's syndrome. The adrenal was replaced by malignant cells and expanses of myxoid material. The cells were positive for melan-A, synaptophysin, vimentin and alpha-inhibin. The ultrastructural features of the cells were typical of adrenal cortical differentiation. The differential diagnosis of myxoid ACC includes extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, chordoma, myxoid adenocarcinoma, myxoma, lipomatous tumors, nerve sheath tumors, smooth muscle tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumor and other sarcomas. The presence of myxoid material in a retroperitoneal lesion raises a broad differential diagnosis in which myxoid adrenocortical neoplasms should be included. Clinicoradiological correlation may be helpful, but special stains, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural examination may be necessary to establish the diagnosis.</str>

      <str>The authors report six cases of tumours limited to the cervical inter-vertebral foramen. The patients presented with cervico-brachial neuralgias occasionally accompanied by radicular sensitivo-motor impairment. Radiographs and tomographs of the cervical spine demonstrated enlargement of the intervertebral foramen with bone proliferation depending on the etiology and provided in easy diagnosis in all the cases. A myelogram showed the absence of extension into the spinal canal thus allowing distinction from the group of dumbell tumors. In the six cases vertebral angiography gave information regarding the vascularisation and relationships of the tumour. The histological diagnosis was different in each case : neurofibroma, chordoma, osteochondroma, osteoma, osteoblastoma and an aneurysmal bone cyst. The same surgical approach was used in the six cases. Neither a laminectomy with facettectomy, nor a classical antero-lateral approach allow for a satisfactory exposition of the tumor. On the contrary a lateral interscalenic approach including dissection of the brachial plexus lead to a trouble free excision. This approach was precised by anatomical dissections.</str>

      <str>Twenty-one patients with chordoma were treated at the Radiation Oncology Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, between 1949 and 1986. Thirteen patients had sacrococcygeal tumors, five had clival tumors, two had nasopharyngeal tumors, and one had a lumbar spine tumor. Nine patients were treated with surgery alone, eight patients with subtotal resection and postoperative irradiation, and four patients with radiotherapy alone after biopsy. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 74% and 46%, respectively. The 10-year actuarial survival rate was significantly better in patients treated with surgery alone or surgery and irradiation than in those treated with radiotherapy alone (52%, 32%, and 0%, respectively, p = 0.02). Although all patients ultimately suffered a recurrence, those with lumbosacral tumors treated with surgery and irradiation had a longer mean disease-free survival period (6.6 years) than those treated with surgery alone (4.1 years) (p = 0.08). Disease-free survival times of patients with base of the skull tumors was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Irradiation after resection of chordomas appears to increase the time to first relapse in lumbosacral tumors and should be considered after subtotal resection.</str>

      <str>This study evaluated the surgical results of the anteromedial approach for treatment of orbital lesions in 16 patients. Pre- and postoperatively, all patients underwent a complete physical examination focusing on the head and neck area including a thorough ophthalmologic evaluation, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The surgical approach was limited to a medial orbitotomy in five patients; the remaining 11 patients underwent a medial orbitotomy combined with an external sphenoethmoidectomy. The tumor was removed completely without damaging the intraorbital neurovascular structures in all but one patient whose recurrent clival chordoma extended beyond the limits of an extracranial approach. Fibro-osseous lesions, cavernous hemangiomas, and dermoid cysts were the most common pathologies. The follow-up ranged from 18 to 48 months, and no patient has shown evidence of a recurrence. One patient with a clival chordoma received radiation therapy. The lateral nasal skin incision healed with acceptable cosmetic results. The anteromedial approach to the orbit provides a wider working space and direct exposure while protecting neurovascular structures.</str>

      <str>Six patients underwent translumbar amputation (TLA), a life-saving procedure, after standard modalities of therapy failed to control the progression of the disease. The primary diagnoses were as follows: pelvic arterial-venous (A-V) malformation, 1; sacral chordoma, 3; giant cell tumor of the sacrum, 1; and paraplegia with squamous cell cancer arising in intractable decubitus, 1. There were no operative deaths. The following postoperative complications developed in five patients: urinary fistulae, 2; small bowel obstruction, 1; intraabdominal bleeding, 1; hypertension, 2; small bowel fistula, 1; and dehiscence of skin closure, 1. Two patients died with distant metastases (24 months) and distant metastases with local recurrence (6 months). The remaining four patients were alive and well 72, 56, 48, and 18 months after the surgical procedure. All of these patients have reached the rehabilitation goals.</str>

      <str>Objective Chordoma is a locally aggressive tumor. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of different surgical approaches and adjuvant radiation modalities used to treat these patients. Design Meta-analysis. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Results The 5-year OS and PFS rates of the whole cohort (n = 467) were 86% and 65.7%, respectively. The 5-year DSS for patients who underwent open surgery and endoscopic surgery was 45% and 49%, respectively (p = 0.8); PFS was 94% and 79%, respectively (p = 0.11). The 5-year OS of patients treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy was 90% compared with 70% of those treated by surgery alone (p = 0.24). Patients undergoing partial resection without adjuvant radiotherapy had a 5-year OS of 41% and a DSS of 45%, significantly lower than in the total-resection group (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.01, respectively). The complication rates were similar in the open and endoscopic groups. Conclusions Patients undergoing total resection have the best outcome; adjuvant radiation therapy improves the survival of patients undergoing partial resection. In view of the advantages of minimally invasive techniques, endoscopic surgery appears an appropriate surgical approach for this disease. </str>

      <str>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diverticula are uncommonly associated with anterior cranial base tumors. When they occur, they often complicate the surgical management of these tumors via a transsphenoidal approach. This report examines the effectiveness of transsphenoidal surgery in the treatment of these rare entities.</str>
      <str>We performed a review of four sellar and parasellar tumors (three pituitary adenomas and one chordoma) that contained an arachnoid diverticulum communicating with the intracranial subarachnoid space.</str>
      <str>One of these tumors (a prolactinoma) was successfully treated medically and regressed dramatically in size; the remaining three were treated by transsphenoidal resection. In all of the operative cases, the tumor was successfully resected with no endocrinological or neurological deficit. An intraoperative CSF leak was encountered in each operative case and was treated by packing the sella with an abdominal fat graft. One patient returned to the operating room for a CSF leak repair. No instances of infection, meningitis, or other major complications occurred. Sellar and parasellar tumors associated with arachnoid diverticula can be successfully treated using transsphenoidal surgery.</str>
      <str>Preoperative anatomic localization of the CSF diverticulum, as well as anticipatory planning for an intraoperative CSF leak are essential. Whenever possible, it is probably wise to preserve the arachnoidocele rather than to rupture it intentionally, obliterating the dead space within the sella in either situation.</str>
