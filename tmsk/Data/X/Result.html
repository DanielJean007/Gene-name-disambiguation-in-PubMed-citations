<str>The assembly of eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes involves the formation of half-proteasomes where precursor beta-type subunits gather in position on an alpha-subunit ring, followed by the association of two half-proteasomes and beta-subunit processing. In vertebrates three additional beta-subunits (beta1i/LMP2, beta2i/MECL1, and beta5i/LMP7) can be synthesized and substituted for constitutive homologues (beta1/delta, beta2/Z, and beta5/X) to yield immunoproteasomes, which are important for generating certain antigenic peptides. We have shown previously that when all six beta-subunits are present, cooperative assembly mechanisms limit the diversity of proteasome populations. Specifically, LMP7 is incorporated preferentially over X into preproteasomes containing LMP2 and MECL1. We show here that the LMP7 propeptide is responsible for this preferential incorporation, and it also enables LMP7 to incorporate into proteasomes containing delta and Z. In contrast, the X propeptide restricts incorporation to proteasomes with delta and Z. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LMP7 propeptide can function in trans when expressed on LMP2, and that its NH(2)-terminal and mid-regions are particularly critical for function. In addition to identifying a novel propeptide function, our results raise the possibility that one consequence of LMP7 incorporation into both immunoproteasomes and delta/Z proteasomes may be to increase the diversity of antigenic peptides that can be generated.</str>

<str>Biogenesis of mammalian 20 S proteasomes occurs via precursor complexes containing alpha and unprocessed beta subunits. A human homologue of the yeast proteasome maturation factor Ump1 was identified in 2D gels of 16 S precursor preparations and designated as POMP (proteasome maturation protein). We show that POMP is detected only in precursor fractions and not in fractions containing mature 20 S proteasome. Northern blot experiments revealed that expression of POMP is induced after treatment with interferon gamma. To analyse the role of the beta 5 propeptide for proper maturation and incorporation of the beta 5 subunit into the complex, human T2 cells, which highly express derivatives of the beta 5i subunit (LMP7), were studied. In contrast to yeast, the presence of the beta 5 propeptide is not essential for incorporation of LMP7 into the proteasome complex. Mutated LMP7 subunits either carrying the prosequence of beta 2i (LMP2) or containing a mutation in the active threonine site are incorporated like wild-type LMP7, while a LMP7 derivative lacking the prosequence completely is incorporated to a lesser extent. Although the absence of the prosequence does not affect incorporation of LMP7, its deletion leads to delayed proteasome maturation and thereby to an accumulation of precursor complexes. As a result of the precursor accumulation, an increased amount of the POMP protein can be detected in these cells.</str>
