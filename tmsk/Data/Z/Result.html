<str>In humans, mutations in the gene encoding cereblon (CRBN) are associated with mental retardation. Although CRBN has been investigated in several cellular contexts, its function remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CRBN plays a role in regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Heterologous expression of CRBN inhibited proteasome activity in a human neuroblastoma cell line. Furthermore, proteasome subunit beta type 4 (PSMB4), the β7 subunit of the 20S core complex, was identified as a direct binding partner of CRBN. These findings suggest that CRBN may modulate proteasome activity by directly interacting with the β7 subunit.</str>

<str>Subunit HsN3 of the human proteasome is a beta-type subunit homologous to PRE4 from yeast, X1 beta from Xenopus and RN3 from the rat. Using electron microscopy, the binding sites of a monoclonal antibody with specificity for subunit HsN3 have been located in the two juxtaposed inner rings of the human proteasome. Subunit HsN3 was present in two copies, one in each ring, in accordance with our concept of two identical halves making up the complete human proteasome. The subunit is involved in the trypsin-like as well as the peptidylglutamyl-peptide cleavage activities.</str>

<str>Proteasome-mediated proteolysis is a primary protein degradation pathway in cells. The present study demonstrates that c-Abl and Arg (abl-related gene) tyrosine kinases associate with and phosphorylate the proteasome PSMA7 (alpha4) subunit at Tyr-153. Consequently, proteasome-dependent proteolysis is compromised. Notably, cells expressing a phosphorylation mutant of PSMA7(Y153F) display impaired G1/S transition and S/G2 progression, highlighting the biological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of a proteasome subunit as an important cellular regulatory control.</str>

<str>Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is mediated by the proteasome. To understand the structure and function of the human 26S proteasome, we cloned complete ORFs of 32 human proteasome subunits and conducted a yeast two-hybrid analysis of their interactions with each other. We observed that there are 114 interacting-pairs in the human 26S proteasome. About 10% (11/114) of these interacting-pairs was confirmed by the GST-pull down analysis. Among these observed interacting subunits, 58% (66/114) are novel and the rest 42% (48/114) has been reported previously in human or in other species. We observed new interactions between the 19S regulatory particle and the beta-rings of the 20S catalytic particle and therefore proposed a modified model of the 26S proteasome.</str>
