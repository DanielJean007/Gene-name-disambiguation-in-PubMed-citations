<str>Protein Z (PZ) is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor without catalytic activity. Evidence points towards PZ as an independent risk factor for the occurrence of human peripheral arterial disease. However, the role of PZ in ischemia-driven angiogenesis and vascular healing processes has not been elucidated so far.</str>
<str>Angiogenic potency of PZ was assessed in established in vitro assays using endothelial cells. PZ-deficient (PZ(-/-)) mice and their wild-type littermates (PZ(+/+)) were subjected to hindlimb ischemia. Furthermore, PZ(-/-) mice were exposed to PZ expressing adenovirus (AdV-PZ) or control adenovirus (AdV-GFP). In an additional set of animals, PZ(-/-) mice were exposed to AdV-PZ and AdV-GFP, each in combination with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100.</str>
<str>In vitro, PZ stimulated migratory activity and capillary-like tube formation of endothelial cells comparable to SDF-1. PZ(-/-) mice exhibited diminished hypoxia-driven neovascularization and reperfusion in post-ischemic hindlimbs, which was restored by adenoviral gene transfer up to levels seen in PZ(+/+) mice. The stimulatory impact of PZ on endothelial cells in vitro was abolished by siRNA targeting against PZ and PZ was not able to restore reduced migration after knock-down of CXCR4. The increased surface expression of CXCR4 on PZ-stimulated endothelial cells and the abrogated restoration of PZ(-/-) mice via AdV-PZ after concomitant treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 supports the idea that PZ mediates angiogenesis via a G-protein coupled pathway and involves the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. This is underlined by the fact that addition of the G-protein inhibitor PTX to PZ-stimulated endothelial cells abolished the effect of PZ on capillary-like tube formation.</str>
<str>The results of the current study reveal a role of PZ in ischemia-induced angiogenesis, which involves a G-protein coupled pathway and a raised surface expression of CXCR4. Our findings thereby extend the involvement of PZ from the coagulation cascade to a beneficial modulation of vascular homeostasis.</str>

<str>The thrombotic risk associated with protein Z (PZ) deficiency is unclear. Anti-protein Z (anti-PZ) has been described as a risk factor in unexplained embryo demise. The aim of our study was to evaluate a possible PZ deficiency and presence of anti-PZ antibodies on thrombotic diseases.</str>
<str>We performed a case-control study on 114 patients with preexisting arterial or venous thrombosis (50 and 64, respectively). Thrombosis was studied based on etiology (creating factor risk subgroups) and on specific thrombotic disease.</str>
<str>PZ levels of patients were significantly lower compared to controls (1709+-761.3 ng/mL vs. 2437+-964.7 ng/mL P=0.001). The high arterial risk factor subgroup showed the lowest PZ level (1267.5+-609 ng/mL) whereas the rest of arterial and venous etiological subgroups presented similar PZ levels. Patients with peripheral artery disease had the lowest PZ level (1022+-966 ng/mL). The rest of arterial and venous thrombotic diseases presented similar PZ levels. A significant increased risk for arterial and venous thrombosis for the lowest (&lt;1685 ng/mL) quartile of PZ has been founded (OR:52, P=0.001 and OR:18, P=0.007, respectively). Anti-PZ antibodies were negative in the majority of patients, although mean anti-PZ IgG antibody levels in the arterial thrombosis group were significantly higher compared to venous thrombosis and control groups (P=0.05 and P=0.005, respectively).</str>
<str>The results suggest that both arterial and venous thrombotic events are related to low PZ levels and that low PZ concentrations are associated with thrombosis in our study. In arterial thrombosis our findings strengthen previous studies that related low PZ levels to atherosclerotic disease. Anti-PZ antibodies do not seem to play a potent role in thrombosis.</str>
