<str>The α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene 1 (FUT1) and 2 (FUT2), respectively, regulate H antigen synthesis in red blood cells and body fluids. Genetic polymorphisms of FUT1 and FUT2 are ethnically and geographically specific.</str>
<str>Healthy unrelated Tibetan blood donors (n = 200) from the Tibet Autonomous Region of China were recruited for this study. The entire FUT1 and FUT2 coding regions were amplified and sequenced. The haplotypes including novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined by clone sequencing.</str>
<str>In Tibetans, the major FUT1 allele was wild-type allele with a frequency of 97.75%. One novel FUT1 allele was defined by a novel synonymous mutation (846T&gt;G). The two most common FUT2 alleles were functional allele Se(357) with a frequency of 32.75% and nonfunctional allele se(357,385) with a frequency of 55%. Two new FUT2 alleles were found at low frequency. They were characterized by two novel SNPs on the basis of se(357,385) : 617 T&gt;G (V206G) and 841 G&gt;A (G281R).</str>

<str>The para-Bombay phenotype results from a variety of mutations in the α-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1). We investigated samples from seven Chinese probands serologically typed as having the para-Bombay phenotype.</str>
<str>The para-Bombay phenotype was identified by standard serological methods. Genetic mutations of FUT1 and FUT2 genes were analysed by DNA sequencing. Heterozygous mutations of FUT1 were identified by TOPO cloning sequencing. Blood samples from 331 randomly-selected Chinese donors were analysed with the SNaPshot system to distinguish five known mutations (Se C357T, A385T, G428A, G716A and FUT1 880delTT) in the FUT1 and FUT2 genes. The genetic characteristics of all para-Bombay probands identified in the Fujian Blood Centre, including those in the present study, were also summarised.</str>
<str>Three FUT1 genotypes, h1/h1 (5 individuals), h1/h6 (1 individual) and h3/h2 (1 individual), and three FUT2 genotypes, Se(357)/Se(357) (5 individuals), Se(357)/Se(357, 385) (1 individual) and Se(357)/Se(357, 716) (1 individual) were observed in seven para-Bombay probands. Among 331 donors, only one individual carried the G716A and 880delTT mutations in heterozygosity; this subjects FUT1 and FUT2 genotypes were H/h2 and Se(357)/Se(357, 716), respectively.</str>
<str>The review of all para-Bombay probands identified in the Fujian Blood Centre showed that h1 and h2 are the predominant non-functional FUT1 alleles in Fujian para-Bombay individuals. Our data confirm the hypothesis that the h2 allele is linked to Se(357, 716), and the concurrence of unique FUT1 and FUT2 mutations is geographically specific.</str>

<str>Rare individuals (Bombay and para-Bombay phenotypes) fail to express the A, B and H antigens on erythrocyte membranes because of a lack in the H gene (FUT1)-encoded alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity. In this study, we have found a para-Bombay individual (Bmh) who expressed B and H antigens in saliva but not on red blood cells. The FUT1 alleles of this person contained two single base changes (T460C and G1042A) in the coding region relative to the wild type allele. These substitutions may result in changes in two amino acid residues (Y154H and E348K).</str>
<str>Since the T460C and G1042A mutations destroy endonuclease RsaI and AvaI sites, respectively, we tested for these mutations using PCR-RFLP.</str>
<str>Our findings indicated that this para-Bombay person was homozygous for the T460C and G1042A mutations, and that neither of these mutations was found in 136 randomly selected Japanese individuals. The measurement of the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity after transient expression of the FUT1 alleles in COS-7 cells indicated that the H-deficient allele-encoded enzyme had no detectable activity. Moreover, transfection by chimera FUT1 allele contains only the T460C mutation, or only the G1042A mutation, and yielded 1.0 or 9.3%, respectively, of the activities compared to transfection by the wild type allele.</str>
<str>These results suggest that the two mutations in combination are responsible for the inactivation of the FUT1-encoded enzyme activity.</str>

<str>The para-Bombay phenotype is characterized by H-deficient or H-partially deficient red blood cells (RBCs) in persons who secrete ABH antigens in their saliva. The studies that determined the genotypes for two Chinese individuals with the para-Bombay phenotype are described.</str>
<str>RBC phenotypes were characterized by conventional serologic methods. Exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene were amplified, as well as the entire coding region for FUT1 and FUT2, with four independence polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) from genomic DNA. PCR products were excised, purified from agarose gels, and sequenced directly. Mutations of FUT1 were identified by TOPO cloning sequencing.</str>
<str>For both individuals, RBC ABO genotypes correlated with ABH substances in their saliva. One individual (a patient) had two heterozygous mutations of FUT1 by direct DNA sequencing, namely, a C--&gt;T heterozygous mutation at position 293(C293T) and AG heterozygous deletion (CAGAGAG--&gt;CAGAG) at position 547 to 552. These two mutations were confirmed to be compound heterozygotes; that is, each mutation was determined to be on a separate homologous chromosome by TOPO cloning sequencing. The FUT2 genotype was Se(357)Se(357). The other individual (a blood donor) had an AG deletion at position 547 to 552 homozygous allele in FUT1. The FUT2 genotype was Se(357)Se(357,385). C293T mutation can cause Thr/Met at amino acid position 98. AG deletion at position 547 to 552 caused a reading frameshift and a premature stop codon.</str>
<str>A novel nonfunctional FUT1 allele C293T was identified in a person with the para-Bombay phenotype. This rare H-deficient phenotype may result from different nonfunctional alleles.</str>

<str>The C35T mutant α-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene had been reported related to the para-Bombay phenotype, but recently, our laboratory found that the C35T was a polymorphism in the Chinese population. This study aims at further clarifying the property of C35T mutant FUT1.</str>
<str>The mutant C35T FUT1 gene was cloned into expression vector in vitro, the mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the mutant enzyme's activity was determined in vitro.</str>
<str>The results showed that the frequencies of 35C and 35T alleles were 0.735 and 0.265, respectively. The FUT1 mRNA level of transfected cells with C35T recombination vector showed 99.85% of the wild-type FUT1 transfected cells. The enzyme relative activity of transfected cell lysates with C35T FUT1 recombination vector was 79.45% compared with that of the wild-type FUT1 transfected cell lysates. The K(m)(phenyl-gal) value of enzyme encoded by C35T allele was 0.5 times higher than that of the enzyme encoded by FUT1 wild-type allele.</str>

<str>Abnormal α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity due to gene mutation results in decreased synthesis of H antigen and leads to an H-deficient phenotype. Here we studied the underlying molecular mechanisms in 7 Chinese blood donors with the H-deficient phenotype.</str>
<str>Red blood cell typing was performed using standard serologic tests, and ABO genotype was analyzed using ABO polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primer tests. The coding sequence of the FUT1 gene was amplified using the specific primers. The FUT1 alleles were identified by a pCRII-TOPO carrier for TOPO TA cloning sequencing.</str>
<str>The H-deficient phenotype frequency was estimated to be approximately 1/30,000 (6/159,515) in the Chinese Han population. The FUT1 gene mutation was demonstrated in 6 Chinese blood donors with the H-deficient phenotype. In only 1 case, no mutation was detected. Novel FUT1 alleles were found in 1 donor. One of these novel FUT1 alleles showed nucleotide 35C&gt;T and 748C&gt;T site mutations that resulted in amino acid substitution of Ala to Val and Trp to Arg at positions 11 and 250, respectively. Another novel FUT1 allele had a nucleotide 655G&gt;C site mutation, causing amino acid substitution of Leu to Val at position 219.</str>

<str>The α 1,2-fucosyltransferase I (FUT1) enzyme is important for the biosynthesis of H antigens, Lewis B, and Lewis Y. In this study, we clarified the transcriptional regulation of FUT1 in the DLD-1 colon cancer cell line, which has high expression of Lewis B and Lewis Y antigens, expresses the FUT1 gene, and shows α 1,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT) activity. 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed a FUT1 transcriptional start site -10 nucleotides upstream of the site registered at NM_000148 in the DataBase of Human Transcription Start Sites (DBTSS). Using the dual luciferase assay, FUT1 gene expression was shown to be regulated at the region -91 to -81 nt to the transcriptional start site, which contains the Elk-1 binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of this region revealed the Elk-1 binding site to be essential for FUT1 transcription. Furthermore, transfection of the dominant negative Elk-1 gene, and the chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIp) assay, supported Elk-1-dependent transcriptional regulation of FUT1 gene expression in DLD-1 cells. These results suggest that a defined region in the 5'-flanking region of FUT1 is critical for FUT1 transcription and that constitutive gene expression of FUT1 is regulated by Elk-1 in DLD-1 cells.</str>

<str>The FUT1 gene of an Austrian proband with the Bombay phenotype was characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the full-length coding sequence. A PCR method using sequence-specific primers for FUT2 genotyping in whites was developed. The plasma alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase activity was determined. The distribution of the mutations underlying 24 h alleles and 7 se alleles was analyzed.</str>
<str>The proband carried a new h allele. Two nucleotide changes, G785A and C786A, in codon 262 of the FUT1 gene resulted in the replacement of serine by lysine. No alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase activity was detected in the proband's plasma. The proband was homozygous for the seG428A allele. Six of 17 missense mutations in nonfunctional h and se alleles occurred in highly conserved fucosyltransferase motifs. No loss-of-function mutation was observed in the aminoterminal section encompassing the transmembraneous helix.</str>
<str>The missense mutation S262K in the FUT1 gene caused the loss of H transferase activity. The analysis of the distribution of mutations in nonfunctional FUT1 and FUT2 genes can point to functionally important domains in the H transferase.</str>

<str>This study was aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms for para-Bombay phenotype formation. The H antigen of these individuals were identified by serological techniques. The full coding region of alpha (1, 2) fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene of these individuals was amplified by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR product was identified by TOPO cloning sequencing. Analysis and comparison were used to explore the mechanisms of para-bombay phenotype formation in individuals. The results indicated that the full coding region of FUT1 DNA was successfully amplified by PCR and gel electrophoresis. DNA sequencing and analysis found that h1 (547-552delAG) existed in one chromosome and h4 (35C &gt; T) existed in the other chromosome of NO.1 individual. Meantime, h1 (547-552delAG) was found in two chromosomes of NO.2 and NO.3 individual. It also means that FUT1 gene of NO.1 individual was h1h4 heterozygote, FUT1 gene of NO.2 and NO.3 individuals were h1h1 homozygote. It is concluded that homozygous and heterozygous mutation of FUT1 gene can lead to the formation of para-Bombay phenotype. </str>

<str>The ABO genotypes of these para-Bombay individuals correlated with the types of ABH substances found in the saliva.

These three mutations were rare sequence variations, each with an allele frequency of less than 0.005. Phe174 might be functionally important because this residue is conserved from mouse to human. Their FUT2 genotypes were Se357se357,385 for the h2h6 individual and Se357Se357) for the others. Both FUT2 alleles were known: one functional (Se357) and one weakly functional (se357,385).

<str>This study reports the determination of the carbohydrate epitope of monoclonal antibody F77 previously raised against human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (Zhang, G., Zhang, H., Wang, Q., Lal, P., Carroll, A. M., de la Llera-Moya, M., Xu, X., and Greene, M. I. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 107, 732-737). We performed a series of co-transfections using mammalian expression vectors encoding specific glycosyltransferases. We thereby identified branching enzymes and FUT1 (required for Fucα1→2Gal linkage) as being essential for F77 antigen formation. When immortalized normal prostate 267B1 cells were transfected with FUT1 alone, cells showed weak expression of F77 antigen. By contrast, cells co-transfected with FUT1 plus either GCNT1, GCNT2, or GCNT3 (an enzyme required to form GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc) showed robust F77 antigen expression, suggesting that F77 specifically binds to Fucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc. RT-PCR for FUT1, GCNT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed that F77-positive cell lines indeed express transcripts encoding FUT1 plus one GCNT. F77-positive prostate cancer cells transfected with siRNAs targeting FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed significantly reduced F77 antigen, confirming the requirement of these enzymes for epitope synthesis. We also found that hypoxia induces F77 epitope expression in immortalized prostate RWPE1 cells, which express F77 antigen moderately under normoxia but at an elevated level under hypoxia. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated up-regulation of FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 transcripts in RWPE1 cells under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia up-regulates glycosyltransferase expression required for F77 antigen synthesis. These results define the F77 epitope and provide a potential mechanism for F77 antigen synthesis in malignant prostate cancer. </str>

<str>RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus) is a highly virulent calicivirus that has become a major cause of mortality in wild rabbit populations (Oryctolagus cuniculus). It binds to the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) H type 2 which requires an alpha1,2fucosyltransferase for its synthesis. In rabbit, three alpha1,2fucosyltransferases genes are known, Fut1, Fut2, and Sec1. Nonfunctional alleles at any of these loci could potentially confer resistance to RHDV, similar to human FUT2 alleles that determine the nonsecretor phenotype and resistance to infection by various NoV strains. In this study, we looked for the presence of H type 2 on buccal epithelial cells of wild rabbits from two geographic areas under RHDV pressure and from one RHDV-free area. Some animals with diminished H type 2 expression were found in the three populations (nonsecretor-like phenotype). Their frequency markedly increased according to the RHDV impact, suggesting that outbreaks selected survivors with low expression of the virus ligand. Polymorphisms of the Fut1, Fut2, and Sec1 coding regions were determined among animals that either died or survived outbreaks. The Fut2 and Sec1 genes presented a high polymorphism and the frequency of one Sec1 allele was significantly elevated, over 6-fold, among survivors. Sec1 enzyme variants showed either moderate, low, or undetectable catalytic activity, whereas all variant Fut2 enzymes showed strong catalytic activity. This functional analysis of the enzymes encoded by each Fut2 and Sec1 allele suggests that the association between one Sec1 allele and survival might be explained by a deficit of alpha1,2fucosyltransferase expression rather than by impaired catalytic activity.</str>

<str>The H epitope, an alpha(1-2)fucosylated carbohydrate structure, has been implicated in initial attachment of the murine blastocyst to luminal uterine epithelial cells in vitro. In this study, the expression of the H-type alpha(1-2)fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene was examined in endometrium of mice. Northern blotting of luminal epithelial RNA identified a single 6.2-kilobase transcript. In situ hybridization studies showed a signal for FUT1 mRNA on Days 1-3 of pregnancy in glands and luminal epithelium. The signal diminished by Day 4 and could not be detected on Day 5 of pregnancy. The in situ signal in endometrial epithelia was highest at estrus and metestrus and was absent at diestrus. Estrogen treatment after ovariectomy gave strong FUT1 mRNA expression in epithelia, but with progesterone, progesterone + estrogen, or vehicle, no message could be detected. A semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of FUT1 mRNA from luminal epithelium generated large amounts of PCR product on Day 1 of pregnancy; this diminished on Days 2, 3, and 4, and the product was barely detectable on Day 5. A kinetic analysis of FUT1 activity on Day 1 of pregnancy suggested a single enzyme with a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 0.29 mM towards phenyl-beta-D-galactoside and of 1.75 mM towards Galbeta(1-3)GalNAc. These results suggest that expression of the H epitope is regulated at the level of FUT1 transcription and that transcription is stimulated by estrogen in the endometrial epithelium.</str>

<str>Recent studies have suggested that at least three transcription-initiation sites were present in the human H-type alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1). In the present study, we have investigated these transcription start sites of FUT1 in undifferentiated leukemic cells (K562) that have erythroid characteristics, in erythroleukemia cells (HEL), and in bone marrow cells. K562 cells used exclusively exon 1 as the start site. While HEL cells used mainly exon 2 as the start site, the major start site for bone marrow cells was within exon 7. In addition, we investigated the transcription start site(s) in vascular endothelial cells (ECV304) as an example of mature cells and found that the start site was predominantly within exon 7. The promoter activities were found in the 5' flanking regions of these three start sites after transfection of constructs with luciferase reporter gene into K562 and HEL cells. These findings suggested that the transcription start sites of FUT1 changed during differentiation of the erythroid lineage and that the tissue-specific and stage-specific expressions of the FUT1 were regulated by three distinct promoters. We also found that the 5' flanking region of exon 2 (intron 1) consisted of repetitive sequences (chromosome 19-specific 37-bp minisatellite repeats, Alu sequence and long terminal repeat) and that the start site of exon 2 was within the long terminal repeat. Thus, these repetitive sequences may play a role in the expression of the FUT1.</str>

The new 412G&gt;A (G138S) mutation also is located in the catalytic domain. A new nonsecretor allele, based on the presence of 428G&gt;A (nonsense), was found.

<str>The expression of the ABO antigens on erythrocyte membranes is regulated by H gene (FUT1)-encoded alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity. We have examined the expression of the FUT1 in several tumor cell lines, including erythroid lineage and normal bone marrow cells, by Northern blot and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. RT-PCR indicated that bone marrow cells, erythroleukemic cells (HEL), and highly undifferentiated leukemic cells (K562) that have erythroid characteristics expressed the FUT1 mRNA while four leukemic cell lines did not. The FUT1 mRNA was also demonstrated in gastric, colonic, and ovarian (MCAS) cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. Northern blot analysis indicated that a 4. 0-kilobase FUT1 transcript was expressed in some of these tumor cell lines. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA end (RACE) analysis suggested that the FUT1 transcript had several forms generated by two distinct transcription start sites and alternative splicing. The results of RT-PCR using specific primers for each starting exon suggested that two transcription initiation sites (exon 1A and exon 2A) of the FUT1 were identified in gastric cancer cells and in ovarian cancer cells. Only exon 1A was identified as a transcription start site in another gastric cancer cell line, two colonic cancer cell lines, and in K562 cells, whereas only exon 2A was identified in HEL cells and in bone marrow cells. These two transcription start sites were located 1.8 kilobases apart. Therefore, two distinct promoters appeared to be present in the FUT1. The distinct promoters of the FUT1 and alternative splicing of the FUT1 mRNA may be associated with time- and tissue-specific expression of the FUT1.</str>

<str>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F18(ECF18) is a main pathogen that causes edema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets, and al-fucosytransferase (FUT1) gene has been identified as a candidate gene for controlling the expression of the receptor for ECF18 bacteria. The genetic variations at position 307 nucleotide in open reading frame of FUT1 gene in 26 pig breeds (total 1458 individuals) from 5 western commercial pig breeds and 21 Chinese native pig breeds were investigated by PCR-RFLP. The results showed that the genetic polymorphisms of the FUT1 locus were only detected in 5 western pig breeds and the Chinese Lingao pig breed, 5 western pig breeds possessed 3 different genotypes, and Lingao pig breed had two susceptible genotypes GG and AG, while all the other 20 Chinese native pig breeds only presented the susceptible genotype GG. The results indicated that if M307G-A point mutation in the coding region of FUT1 gene was the key factor determining the expression of the ECF18 receptor, most of Chinese native pig breeds were absent of the genetic background on the resistance to ECF18 bacteria. In this case, it was inferred that the resistance gene to ECF18 might be originated from western pig breeds. In addition, it is of great importance for the conservation of Lingao pig breed as it is the only found Chinese native pig breed possessing resistance M307A allele in FUT1 gene. Generally, compared with exotic pig breeds, Chinese native pig breeds have stronger resistance to edema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. The results suggested that further study should be done to identify and characterize putative QTL (quantitative trait locus) or/and the functional gene responsible for the resistance to ECF18 in Chinese native pig breeds.</str>

Fut1 siRNA also inhibited myeloid THP-1 adhesion to RA synovial fibroblasts and RA synovial fibroblast proliferation.</str>

FUT1 gene expression was detected in 11 pig tissues with the highest level in lung, and expressed consistently at the four time points. In most tissues, FUT1 gene expression levels decreased from days 8 to 18, then continually increased on days 30 and 35, with expression around weaning time higher than that on day 8. Gene ontology and pathway analysis showed that FUT1 was involved in 32 biological processes, mainly those integral to the membrane, or involved in glycosylation, as well as regulation of binding, interestingly participating in three pathways related to glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. From this analysis and the high linkage disequilibrium between the FUT1 gene and the E. coli F18 receptor locus, we can speculate that higher expression of the FUT1 gene in small intestine is beneficial to the formation of receptors to the E. coli F18 strain and is related to the sensitivity to the pathogen.</str>

<str>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F18 is a major pathogen that causes postweaning diarrhoea and edema disease in piglets. The alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been identified as an ideal candidate gene for controlling the expression of the receptor for ECF18 bacteria. Therefore, the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to study the function of the FUT1 gene and to produce FUT1 knockdown transgenic pig would be highly beneficial. We developed an effective strategy for the expression of multiple small hairpin RNA simultaneously using multiple RNA polymerase III (hU6, hH1, mU6 and h7SK) promoters in a single vector to knockdown the FUT1 gene. Stable FUT1 knockdown transgenic fibroblast lines were generated by transfecting porcine fetal fibroblasts with the constructed vectors. Real-time RT-PCR indicated that the mRNA level of FUT1 in the transgenic fibroblast lines was significantly lower than that in the control, as much as 29 %. Finally, we successfully obtained transgenic SCNT porcine embryos. Overall, the results demonstrated that this vector-based RNAi expression system is an efficient approach to knockdown FUT1 gene expression in porcine fetal fibroblast cells, which could thereby provide donor cells for somatic cell nuclear cloning and the potential production of a marker-free transgenic pig resistant to F18 related diseases. Furthermore, it also provides strong evidence that this approach could be useful both in the production of transgenic livestock resistant to disease, and in the development of effective strategies for the suppression of gene expression in clinical gene therapy.</str>

<str>Recently, we have reported that in normal gastric epithelium, the expression of gastric apomucins MUC5AC and MUC6 is associated with the specific expression of type 1 and type 2 Lewis antigens, and FUT2 and FUT1 fucosyltransferases, respectively. Until now, there are no data demonstrating the direct implication of specific glycosyltransferases in the specific patterns of apomucin glycosylation. HT29/M3 colon cancer cell line express MUC1, MUC5AC, type 1 Lewis antigens and FUT2 but not type 2 structures and FUT1, as it occurs in the epithelial cells of the gastric superficial epithelium. These cells were transfected with the cDNA of human FUT1, the alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of type 2 Lewis antigens, to assess the implication of FUT1 in the glycosylation of MUC1 and MUC5AC. The M3-FUT1 clones obtained express high levels of type 2 Lewis antigens: H type 2 and Ley antigens. Immunoprecipitation of MUC1 and MUC5AC apomucins gives the direct evidence that FUT1 catalyses the addition of alpha-1,2-fucose to these apomucins, supporting the hypothesis that the pattern of apomucin glycosylation is not only instructed by the mucin primary sequence but also by the set of glycosyltransferases expressed in each specific cell type.</str>

<str>To investigate the molecular genetics basis for one para-Bombay phenotype, the red blood cell phenotype of the proband was characterized by standard serological techniques. Exon 6 and 7 of ABO gene, the entire coding region of FUT1 gene and FUT2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of the proband respectively. The PCR products were purified by agarose gels and directly sequenced. The PCR-SSP and genescan were performed to confirm the mutations detected by sequencing. The results showed that the proband ABO genotype was A(102)A(102). Two heterozygous mutations of FUT1 gene, an A to G transition at position 682 and AG deletion at position 547-552 were detected in the proband. A682G could cause transition of Met--&gt;Val at amino acid position 228, AG deletion at position 547-552 caused a reading frame shift and a premature stop codon. The FUT2 genotype was heterozygous for a functional allele Se(357) and a weakly functional allele Se(357), 385 (T/T homozygous at position 357 and A/T heterozygous at 385 position). It is concluded that the compound heterozygous mutation--a novel A682G missense mutation and a 547-552 del AG is the molecular mechanism of this para-Bombay phenotype.</str>

<str>Current polymerase chain reaction-based strategies for phenotype prediction often fail when sporadic nonfunctional alleles are encountered. The population frequency of such mutations was not known for any gene under low selection pressure and may be best examined in blood groups systems lacking prevalent nonfunctional alleles. The frequency of the very rare Bombay blood group (Oh, genotype hh sese) was recently determined in a systematic survey of more than 600,000 white individuals.</str>
<str>With this survey used in conjunction with additional blood samples, the population frequency of nonfunctional alleles of the gene encoding the alpha (1,2)fucosyltransferase (H or FUT1) was determined.</str>
<str>Seven different h alleles were found in five unrelated individuals, three of whom were homozygous for unique alleles. There was no prevalent h allele. Five missense and one frameshift mutations were observed, that were the presumptive causes of the null phenotype; the coding sequence of one h allele was identical to the H sequence. The average inbreeding factor alpha was 0.00116. The frequency of nonfunctional alleles at the H gene locus was calculated as 1 in 347 in a large white population (95% CI: 1:185-1:824).</str>
<str>The Bombay blood group phenotype in white is due to diverse, sporadic, nonfunctional alleles without any prevalent allele. Assuming similar rates of nonfunctional alleles in glycosyltransferase genes like ABO, current genotyping strategies may fail as often as once in about 300 individuals of blood group O. Sporadic neutral alleles may also pose a serious obstacle for population-wide screening of many disease-associated genes.</str>

<str>In a previous article, we demonstrated the existence of fucosyl-containing O-glycans forms of nucleolin in bovine post-capillary venular endothelial cells (CVEC) and malignant cultured human A431 cells. The tool for this discovery was an antibody found to interact strongly and exclusively with nucleolin in total protein extracts. The antibody was originally raised against a mollusc glycoprotein and was demonstrated to be directed against its O-glycans, recently found to belong prevalently to the blood group H-antigen type with fucose linked in alpha1, 2 to galactose. Here, we show that si-RNA induced down-regulation of the expression of FUT1 and FUT2, the fucosyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of the terminal glycan motif Fucalpha-2-Galbeta-R, reduced expression of the fucosylated nucleolin glycoforms and their exposure at the cell surface in CVEC. Treatment of the cells with FUT1/2 siRNA also reduced their ability to bind and internalize endostatin and their adhesion efficiency and inhibited cell growth. Expression of FUT1, FUT2, and FUT6 was also analyzed in serum-stimulated versus serum-starved cells and in cells treated with FUT1 and FUT2 siRNA. A reduced expression of fucosylated nucleolin and inhibition of cell growth by suppressing FUT1/2 expression was also tested and shown to be exhibited in human A431 cells.</str>

The distribution of genotypes differed between the successfully marketed and disease affected/deceased pig groups. The frequency of the A allele, associated with resistance to edema and post-weaning diarrhea, was higher in the post-weaning survival group (0.21) than in the non-survival group (0.16, P &lt; 0.05). The odds ratio for piglet survival between AA and GG genotypes was 1.98; thus, piglet survival for individuals with the AA genotype was almost two-fold greater than for GG individuals.

Constructs with FUT1 and FUT2 wild type genes, and the FUT2 SewA385T, seG428A and seC571T mutated alleles, were cloned into pcDNAI, and expressed in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells transfected with the SewA385T allele had weak, but detectable, alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity, with an acceptor substrate pattern similar to the wild type FUT2 gene. Comparative kinetic studies from cell extracts with mutated SewA385T and wild type FUT2 alleles gave similar Km values, but less enzyme activity was present in cells transfected with SewA385T (Vmax 230 pmol h-1 mg-1), as compared to those transfected with FUT2 (Vmax 1030 pmol h-1 mg-1), suggesting that the mutated enzyme is more unstable.

<str>Lewis antigens are terminal fucosylated oligosaccharides synthesized by the sequential action of several glycosyltransferases. The fucosyltransferases are the enzymes responsible for the addition of terminal fucose to precursor oligosaccharides attached to proteins or lipids. These oligosaccharides, defined as cell surface markers, have been implicated in different types of intercellular interactions and in adhesion and invasion processes. Transfection of HT-29/M3 colon cancer cells with the full length of human fucosyltransferase (FUT1), induces the synthesis of H type 2 and Lewis y antigens, associated with a decrease of sialyl-Lewis x. The capacity to develop primary tumors when cells were injected intrasplenically was similar in parental and FUT1-transfected cells, but the capacity to colonize the liver after spleen removal was significantly reduced in M3/FUT1 transfected cells. These results indicate that the expression of FUT1 induces changes in the metastatic capacity of HT-29/M3 colon cancer cells, as a consequence of the altered expression pattern of type 2 Lewis antigens. Also, an association between MUC5AC expression and the degree of gland differentiation in both primary splenic tumors and hepatic metastases was detected.</str>

<str>Terminal Fucalpha(1-2)Galbeta epitopes have been proposed to play significant roles in cell-cell interactions in development, cell adhesion, and malignant transformation. To begin to investigate the regulation and function of alpha(1-2)fucosylated epitopes in an animal model, we have isolated and characterized a mouse genomic DNA segment encoding a protein orthologous to the human H blood group locus alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase (FUT1). This segment maintains an open reading frame encoding 376 amino acids sharing 75% sequence identity with the enzyme encoded by human FUT1, and 55% sequence identity with the enzyme encoded by the human Secretor blood group locus (FUT2). Expression of the open reading frame in COS-7 cells yields an alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity with a Km of 7.6 mM for phenyl-beta-d-galactoside. Southern blotting and interspecific backcross analyses indicate that this murine locus represents a single copy sequence mapping to a novel locus 2.1 centimorgans from the Klk1 locus, in a region of homology between mouse chromosome 7 and the human FUT1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 19. Mouse FUT1 yields a 2.8 kb mRNA transcript identifiable in many organs, including thymus, lung, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, colon, uterus and epidiymis. Hybridization analyses in situ localize expression of FUT1 transcripts to thymic medullary and epididymal epithelial cells, implying that this gene determines the expression of cell surface Fucalpha(1-2)Galbeta epitopes in these tissues.</str>

Haplotype analysis with restriction enzyme digestion showed that the two mutations are located on opposing alleles of the H (FUT1) gene and lead to compound heterozygosity.

We studied ABH expression in 166 group A apheresis platelet donors by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and thin layer chromatography relative to donor age, sex, A1/A2 subgroup, and Lewis phenotype. Overall, A antigen on platelet membranes, glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids was linked to an A1 red blood cell (RBC) phenotype. Among A1 donors, platelet ABH varied significantly between donors (0%-87%). Intradonor variability, however, was minimal, suggesting that platelet ABH expression is a stable, donor-specific characteristic, with 5% of A1 donors typing as either ABH high- or low-expressers. Group A2 donors, in contrast, possessed a Bombay-like phenotype, lacking both A and H antigens. Unlike RBCs, ABH expression on platelets may be determined primarily by H-glycosyltransferase (FUT1) activity. Identification of A2 and A1 low expressers may increase the availability and selection of crossmatched and HLA-matched platelets.

<str>The complete coding sequences of three rat alpha1,2fucosyltransferase genes were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed that these genes, called FTA, FTB and FTC, were homologous to human FUT1, FUT2 and Sec1, respectively. A distance analysis between all alpha1,2fucosyltransferase sequences available showed that the two domains of the catalytic region evolved differently with little divergence between the FUT2 and Sec1 N-terminal domains, quite distant from that of FUT1. At variance, FUT1 and FUT2 C-terminal domains were less distant while a high evolutionary rate was noted for Sec1 C-terminal domain. Whereas FTA and FTB encode typical glycosyltransferases, FTC lacks the homologous start codon and encodes a protein devoid of intracellular and transmembrane domains. It is located on rat chromosome 1q34. Transfection experiments revealed that unlike FTA and FTB, FTC does not generate enzyme activity. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that H type 2 epitopes were synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected by both FTA and FTB cDNA, but only FTB transfectants possessed H type 3 determinants. In REG rat carcinoma cells, both FTA and FTB allowed synthesis of H type 2 and H type 3 at the cell surface. Western blots showed that, in both cell types, FTA was able to synthesize H type 2 epitopes on a larger set of glycoproteins than FTB. Analysis of the kinetic parameters obtained using small oligosaccharides revealed only a slight preference of FTA for type 2 over other types of acceptor substrates, whereas FTB was barely able to fucosylate this substrate.</str>

However, faster and cheaper genotyping techniques are now available, which led us to develop an easily applicable, fast and cost effective genetic test to determine the status of the F18 receptor. To check the accuracy of the new test, we genotyped 32 pigs with the established test as well as with our new test. All in all, we genotyped 430 German Landrace pigs. The test was successful.

<str>Genetic diversity in Helicobacter pylori strains may affect the function and antigenicity of virulence factors associated with bacterial infection and, ultimately, disease outcome. In this study, DNA diversity of H. pylori isolates was examined by analysis of vacA genotypes and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of H. pylori-associated genes (vacA, cagA,flaA, ureAB, and ureCD). Thirty-seven H. pylori isolates from 26 patients were successfully classified into distinct vacA allelic genotypes. The signal sequence allele sl (31 of 37) predominated over the s2 allele (6 of 37) and was significantly associated with the occurrence (past or present) of gastric ulcers. A novel midregion allele, designated as m3, has been identified in two H. pylori isolates which could not be typed with midregion allele m1- or m2-specific primers. Additionally, significant nucleotide diversity yielding different amino acid sequences was demonstrated by DNA sequencing of vacA fragments from clinical isolates of H. pylori. Furthermore, RFLP analysis of 45 H. pylori isolates (including 15 paired isolates) obtained from antrum and corpus biopsy specimens from 30 individual patients showed remarkably high interhost diversity (one patient, one H. pylori strain) and intrahost identity in gene sequences coding for VacA, CagA, flagellin, and urease. Only in a single patient was a minor genotypic variation at different anatomic sites within the stomach identified. These data warrant the detailed analysis of the effect of genetic diversity on the function and antigenicity of H. pylori-associated virulence factors.</str>

However, in the vas deferens and prostate, only Fut4 mRNA and Fut2 mRNA were respectively upregulated following exposure to androgen. In the seminal vesicle, all fucosyltransferases, with the exception of Fut9, were upregulated. We identified the androgen receptor binding sites (ARBSs) of Fut2, Fut4 and Fut9 in the caput epididymis. Luciferase assay for these ARBSs is able to provide an indication as to why Fut4 and Fut9 are differently expressed and regulated by androgen, although they catalyze the same α-(1,3) fucose linkage. Our study showed that androgen could differentially regulate the expression of these fucosyltransferases and provided an insight into the characteristic distribution of each fucosyltransferase responsible for LeX/LeY biosynthesis in the male reproductive tract. </str>

<str>Tissue kallikrein is an enzyme involved in the release of kinin in peripheral tissues. It is believed to regulate hemodynamics and electrolyte transport in the kidney. The present study analyzed polymorphisms of tissue kallikrein in Japanese volunteers and examined the associations between allele H in the promoter region, which has been shown to have decreased promoter activity, and urinary kallikrein activity and physiological parameters in subjects on an ad libitum diet. Ninety and 73 volunteers were analyzed for the promoter and coding regions of the tissue kallikrein gene, respectively. The allelic frequency of allele H was found to be 24%. One synonymous and three non-synonymous polymorphisms were found in the coding regions. Urinary kallikrein activity was not significantly decreased in subjects with allele H compared to those without allele H, although they were low in two homozygotes of allele H. Urinary excretions of calcium and sodium were larger in the subjects with allele H than in those without. It is concluded that allele H is a common polymorphism in Japanese and may contribute to decreased reabsorptions of calcium and sodium in the kidney. Further interventional studies are needed to clarify the phenotype of allele H with respect to renal electrolyte handling. </str>

<str>The expression of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferases that catalyze the fucose transfer to galactose of the N-acetyl(iso)lactosamine chain is decreased in human metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. alpha(2,3) Sialyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sialic acid to the same substrate to form, with alpha(1,3/1,4) fucosyltransferases, sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis x determinants on cell surface that are involved in pancreatic metastatic invasion. The aim of this study was to determine whether this decrease of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase expression can favor the alpha(2,3) sialyltransferase activity to form metastatic sialyl-Lewis antigens. Restoration of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase activity in the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 was obtained by selecting stable transfectants expressing FUT1. Overexpression of FUTI in BxPC-3 cells resulted in a substantial reduction of sialyl-Lewis antigen expression that correlated with an increase of expression of Lewis y and H-type antigens on cell surface. The modified oligosaccharide structures were preferentially restricted to three major glycoproteins, which could in part be related to mucin-type glycoproteins. The reduction of sialyl-Lewis antigen expression was associated with an inhibition of adhesive properties to E-selectin and a decrease of gastrointestinal metastatic power of BxPC-3 cells after xenograft transplantation into nude mice. This study provides evidence that the expression level of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase may regulate the expression of sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis x antigens and consequently could play an important role in metastatic properties of human pancreatic cancer cells.</str>

<str>Synthesis of A, B, H, Lewis and related histo-blood group antigens is catalyzed by different fucosyltransferases. Enzymatic acceptor specificity and tissue expression permit the definition of 2 types of alpha-2-fucosyltransferases and 5 types of alpha-3-fucosyltransferases encoded by specific genes registered as FUT1 to FUT7. We have previously assigned FUT4 to 11q21, the cluster FUT1-FUT2 to 19q13.3 and the cluster FUT6-FUT3-FUT5 to 19p13.3. The last gene cloned (FUT7) encodes an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase expressed in leukocytes which synthesizes the sialyl Lĕ antigen, a selectin ligand. We have localized this gene by PCR assay using somatic cell hybrids, which retain rearrangements of chromosome 9 characterized in respect with the genetic microsatellite map, and then by screening a cosmid library. We assign FUT7 to chromosome band 9q34.3 telomeric to D9S1830 and close to the genes ABC2 and C8G.</str>

<str>Notch is a transmembrane receptor that mediates the cell-cell interactions necessary for many cell-fate decisions. Endocytic trafficking of Notch plays important roles in the activation and downregulation of this receptor. A Drosophila O-FucT-1 homolog, encoded by O-fut1, catalyzes the O-fucosylation of Notch, a modification essential for Notch signaling and ligand binding. It was recently proposed that O-fut1 acts as a chaperon for Notch in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for Notch to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we report that O-fut1 has additional functions in the endocytic transportation of Notch. O-fut1 was indispensable for the constitutive transportation of Notch from the plasma membrane to the early endosome, which we show was independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity of O-fut1. We also found that O-fut1 promoted the turnover of Notch, which consequently downregulated Notch signaling. O-fut1 formed a stable complex with the extracellular domain of Notch. In addition, O-fut1 protein added to conditioned medium and endocytosed was sufficient to rescue normal Notch transportation to the early endosome in O-fut1 knockdown cells. Thus, an extracellular interaction between Notch and O-fut1 is essential for the normal endocytic transportation of Notch. We propose that O-fut1 is the first example, except for ligands, of a molecule that is required extracellularly for receptor transportation by endocytosis.</str>

<str>Alpha 1, 2-fucosyltransferase (FUT 1/2) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of Lewis y, a cell membrane-associated carbohydrate antigen. In human ovarian cancer, the upregulated expression of FUT1 and Lewis y is associated with advanced pathological stages and involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the mechanism underlying the upregulation of FUT1 is largely unknown. Here, we identify an AP-1 binding site in FUT1 promoter in ovarian cancer cells. c-Jun promotes FUT1 expression, thereby enhancing Lewis y biosynthesis in various ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, EMSA, luciferase activity and ChIP assays demonstrate c-Jun directly interacts with FUT1 promoter. Furthermore, FUT1 mediates c-Jun-induced cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. In human ovarian cancer samples, c-Jun overexpression is linked to malignant degree and positively correlated to FUT1 and Lewis y expression. Taken together, c-Jun could transcriptionally modulate FUT1 expression in ovarian cancer, implicating the potential application of c-Jun inhibitors for human ovarian cancer therapy. </str>

<str>An epidemiological molecular study was carried out to evaluate the spectrum and allelic frequency of alpha-thalassemia (alpha-thal) defects in Algeria. A series of 153 randomly selected blood donors was screened for 10 alpha-thal alleles described in the Mediterranean area. In addition, six unrelated cases with hematological and biochemical data suggestive of Hb H disease were investigated. Our data revealed an allele frequency of 4.6%. The presence of alpha(0)-thal determinants (-alpha(20.5) and --MED I) was observed both in Hb H patients and in the randomly collected samples. Overall, the -alpha(3.7) deletion was the most prevalent allele (2.9%), followed by the alpha(Nco I)alpha (HBA2:c.1A&gt;G) allele (0.6%) and by the alpha(Hph I)alpha (HBA2:c.95 + 2_95 + 6delTGAGG), -alpha(20.5), --(MED I) alleles (0.3% each). The -alpha(4.2) deletion was observed in only one Hb H patient. These results outline the heterogeneity of the alpha-thal alleles in Algeria which reflects the anthropological history of the country. Because of their frequency, alpha-thal alleles are probably frequent modulators of prevalent beta-globin gene-related hemoglobinopathies in Algeria.</str>

<str>Susceptibility to clarithromycin of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 23SrRNA gene. Allele specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR) is one of the methods for determining SNPs, which can measure SNPs easily within a short period by PCR amplification alone without digestion with restriction enzymes. The aim of the present study was to develop the ASP-PCR assay for determining SNPs at positions 2,142 and 2,143 of the 23S rRNA gene of H. pylori.</str>
<str>In total, 112 patients with H. pylori infection based on positive results of a rapid urease test (RUT) were enrolled in the study. Thirty-five had failed to eradicate H. pylori by a clarithromycin-based regimen. DNA was extracted from the RUT-positive gastric tissue samples. SNPs from adenine to guanine at positions 2,142 and 2,143 of the 23S rRNA of H. pylori (A2,142G and A2,143G) were determined by the ASP-PCR method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clarithromycin for H. pylori were also measured.</str>
<str>Forty-nine of 112 patients were infected with wild-type strains of H. pylori. Thirty-nine patients were infected with strains with A2,143G mutations. Twenty-three patients were infected with both wild-type strains and those with A2,143G mutations. Only one patient was infected with the strain with A2,142G mutation. H. pylori strains with A2,143G or A2,142G mutation had significantly higher MICs for clarithromycin.</str>

<str>Rambam-Hasharon syndrome (RHS) is a newly recognized autosomal recessive inborn error in fucose metabolism. Mental retardation, short stature, coarse facies, and recurrent infections are the main clinical findings. Several fucosilated proteoglycans are deficient in these patients. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 2 is associated with lack of the membrane glycoprotein sialyl-Lewisx (CD15s). In the red blood cells (RBCs), lack of the membrane glycoprotein H is manifested as a Bombay (Oh) blood type. Two consecutive pregnancies it risk for RHS were monitored during mid-trimester by cordocentesis. One fetus expressed H substance and her blood phenotype was O Rh+. The second fetus, a female, was 2 weeks smaller than expected by dates and had the Bombay blood type. The placenta of the affected fetus was small and irregular. This is the first prenatal diagnosis of this syndrome and the first case found in a female. The documentation of the syndrome in patients of both sexes and the parental consanguinity support an autosomal recessive inheritance. Two apparent recombinations between fucosyl-transferase 1 (FUT1, the H gene) and fucosyl-transferase 2 (secretor) are suggestive of non-allelic heterogeneity. We believe that the Bombay phenotype in this family is caused by a mutated gene, other than FUT1, which is causing multiple deficiencies of fucosilated proteoglycans.</str>

<str>ABO blood serotype A is known to be associated with risk of gastric cancer (GC), but little is known how ABO alleles and the fucosyltransferase (FUT) enzymes and genes which are involved in Lewis antigen formation [and in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) binding and pathogenicity] may be related to GC risk in a European population. The authors conducted an investigation of 32 variants at ABO and FUT1-7 loci and GC risk in a case-control study of 365 cases and 1,284 controls nested within the EPIC cohort (the EPIC-Eurgast study). Four variants (including rs505922) in ABO, and allelic blood group A (AO+AA, odds ratio=1.84, 95%CI=1.20-2.80) were associated with diffuse-type GC; however, conditional models with other ABO variants indicated that the associations were largely due to allelic blood group A. One variant in FUT5 was also associated with diffuse-type GC, and four variants (and haplotypes) in FUT2 (Se), FUT3 (Le) and FUT6 with intestinal-type GC. Further, one variant in ABO, two in FUT3 and two in FUT6 were associated with H. pylori infection status in controls, and two of these (in FUT3 and FUT6) were weakly associated with intestinal-type GC risk. None of the individual variants surpassed a Bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of 0.0016; however, after a gene-based permutation test, two loci [FUT3(Le)/FUT5/FUT6 and FUT2(Se)] were significantly associated with diffuse- and intestinal-type GC, respectively. Replication and functional studies are therefore recommended to clarify the role of ABO and FUT alleles in H. pylori infection and subtype-specific gastric carcinogenesis.</str>

<str>Transfection of the mouse Fut1 and Fut2, and human FUT1 genes into human ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-1 cells resulted in 20-30-fold increases in cellular alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity, and in alteration of the glycolipid composition, including not only fucosylated products, but also precursor glycolipids. Although globo-series glycolipids were not significantly affected by the transfection, the major glycolipids belonging to the lacto-series type 1 chain family in RMG-1 cells and the transfectants were the Lc4Cer, Lewis a (Le)a and Leb, and H-1 glycolipids, respectively, suggesting that fucosylation of Lc4Cer to the H-1 glycolipid prevents the further modification of Lc4Cer to Lea and Leb in the transfectants. Also, the lacto-series type 2 chains in RMG-1 cells were LeX, NeuAc-nLc4Cer and NeuAc-LeX, and those in the transfectants were LeX and LeY, indicating that the sialylation of nLc4Cer and LeX is restricted by increased fucosylation of LeX. As a result, the amount of sialic acid released by sialidase from the transfectants decreased to 70% of that from RMG-1 cells, and several membrane-mediated phenomena, such as the cell-to-cell interaction between cancer cells and mesothelial cells, and the cell viability in the presence of an anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil, for the transfectants was found to be increased in comparison to that for RMG-1 cells. These findings indicate that cell surface carbohydrates are involved in the biological properties, including cell-to-cell adhesion and drug resistance, of cancer cells.</str>

<str>A sample of 243 Italian patients affected by the sporadic late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was studied for the HindIII intronic polymorphism of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene and compared with a sample of 148 healthy subjects. Since this polymorphism has been reported to be associated with CAD and because the two pathologies share common aspects, we decided to study it in AD too. We found a difference in the allele distribution, in that the H+ allele was more frequent in patients (0.782) than in controls (0.720); this difference was not quite significant (P = 0.059). The odds ratio from the logistic regression analysis for the H+ carrying genotypes was 2.7 (95% CI = 1.01-7.21; P = 0.048). When the separate genotypes H+H+ and H+H- were entered into the analysis, only H+H+ was found to significantly increase the risk with respect to H-H- (P = 0.029). This means that carrying this allele significantly increases the risk of developing AD, and the risk is mostly associated with the H+H+ genotype.</str>
