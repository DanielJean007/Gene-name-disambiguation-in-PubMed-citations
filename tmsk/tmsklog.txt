# This annotated log shows how tmsk can be applied to sample data.
# It can be used to verify the software works correctly after installation.
# The "%" is the linux shell prompt and precedes the user input.
# For windows, the prompt would be the command-prompt or MSDOS-prompt.
# The "#" precedes comments (such as these).
# Output lines from tmsk routines are without a "#" or "%" character at the
# front.
#
# Several data files are used in this illustration. The tmsk1.properties and
# tmsk2.properties prewire various parameters that are used here.
# They use the sample.xml data which is a very small sample of 10 email
# messages. A stopwords file stop.wds is also used and later on in this
# illustration, testdocs.xml will be used.
# 
# The following line loads the sample tmsk1.properties which has preset
# parameter values for this illustration.
#
% cp tmsk1.properties tmsk.properties
#
# The following line generates a 100 word global dictionary for sample.xml
#
% java mkdict 100 dict.smp
#
# The dictionary is just a text file that can be readily viewed and edited.
# Note how the number of words is 37 since stopword elimination is done at the
# end.

# The following line generates document vectors for the documents in

# Labelled vectors are sought (spam v/s non-spam).
# Note that it takes the input file name, dictionary name, etc from the

# you will need to edit the properties file.

Hi Professor,
Do you have some time this week? I want to ask your advice on my thesis
proposal. I have a problem with my preliminary empirical experiments -- the
results are not supportive enough of my thesis!! Perhaps I am missing something
in the data preparation or perhaps I am not applying the data-mining method
effectively. I'd really appreciate your input. Please let me know when is a
good time to see you.

# Further processing may be done by running other tmsk routines
# or by altering parameters in the tmsk.properties file. Read the
# documentation in tmsk.pdf.
