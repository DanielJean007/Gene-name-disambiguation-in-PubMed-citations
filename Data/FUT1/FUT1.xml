      <str>Recombinant expression vectors of FUT1 682A&gt; G and FUT1 547_552delAG were constructed and transfected into COS-7 cells for stable expression screening. Expression of FUT1 mRNA was determined using real-time quantitative PCR. The activity of FUT1 was measured with high-performance liquid chromatography.</str>
      <str>Stably transfected COS-7 cells with wild type FUT1, FUT1 682A&gt; G and FUT1 547_552delAG were respectively obtained. The FUT1 mRNA level of transfected cells with 682A&gt; G and 547_552delAG recombination vectors have measured 101.69% and 102.79% compared with that of wild type FUT1 transfected cells. A specific protein band with about 46 kD was confirmed in the 682A&gt; G transfected cell lysates by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting with 6× His Tag antibody. Similar protein was not identified in the 547_552delAG cells lysates. Enzymes activity of FUT1 682A&gt; G has measured 61.01% compared with wild type FUT1 protein, whilst the activity of FUT1 547_557delAG was completely abolished.</str>

      <str>Angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Fucosyltransferases (Futs) are involved in angiogenesis and tumour growth. Here, we examined the role of Fut1 in angiogenesis and K/BxN serum transfer arthritis.</str>
      <str>We examined Fut1 expression in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) by quantitative PCR. We performed a number of angiogenesis assays to determine the role of Fut1 using HMVECs, Fut1 null (Fut1(-/-)), and wild type (wt) endothelial cells (ECs) and mice. K/BxN serum transfer arthritis was performed to determine the contribution of Fut1-mediated angiogenesis in Fut1(-/-) and wt mice. A static adhesion assay was implemented with RAW264.7 (mouse macrophage cell line) and mouse ECs. Quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were performed with Fut1(-/-) and wt ECs for adhesion molecule expression.</str>
      <str>Tumour necrosis factor-α induced Fut1 mRNA and protein expression in HMVECs. HMVECs transfected with Fut1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and Fut1(-/-) ECs formed significantly fewer tubes on Matrigel. Fut1(-/-) mice had reduced angiogenesis in Matrigel plug and sponge granuloma angiogenesis assays compared with wt mice. Fut1(-/-) mice were resistant to K/BxN serum transfer arthritis and had decreased angiogenesis and leucocyte ingress into inflamed joints. Adhesion of RAW264.7 cells to wt mouse ECs was significantly reduced when Fut1 was lacking. Fut1(-/-) ECs had decreased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression at mRNA and protein levels compared with wt ECs. ICAM-1 was also decreased in Fut1(-/-) arthritic ankle cryosections compared with wt ankles.</str>

      <str>The expression of the ABO antigens on erythrocyte membranes is regulated by H gene (FUT1)-encoded alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity. We have examined the expression of the FUT1 in several tumor cell lines, including erythroid lineage and normal bone marrow cells, by Northern blot and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. RT-PCR indicated that bone marrow cells, erythroleukemic cells (HEL), and highly undifferentiated leukemic cells (K562) that have erythroid characteristics expressed the FUT1 mRNA while four leukemic cell lines did not. The FUT1 mRNA was also demonstrated in gastric, colonic, and ovarian (MCAS) cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. Northern blot analysis indicated that a 4. 0-kilobase FUT1 transcript was expressed in some of these tumor cell lines. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA end (RACE) analysis suggested that the FUT1 transcript had several forms generated by two distinct transcription start sites and alternative splicing. The results of RT-PCR using specific primers for each starting exon suggested that two transcription initiation sites (exon 1A and exon 2A) of the FUT1 were identified in gastric cancer cells and in ovarian cancer cells. Only exon 1A was identified as a transcription start site in another gastric cancer cell line, two colonic cancer cell lines, and in K562 cells, whereas only exon 2A was identified in HEL cells and in bone marrow cells. These two transcription start sites were located 1.8 kilobases apart. Therefore, two distinct promoters appeared to be present in the FUT1. The distinct promoters of the FUT1 and alternative splicing of the FUT1 mRNA may be associated with time- and tissue-specific expression of the FUT1.</str>

      <str>Notch is a transmembrane receptor that mediates the cell-cell interactions necessary for many cell-fate decisions. Endocytic trafficking of Notch plays important roles in the activation and downregulation of this receptor. A Drosophila O-FucT-1 homolog, encoded by O-fut1, catalyzes the O-fucosylation of Notch, a modification essential for Notch signaling and ligand binding. It was recently proposed that O-fut1 acts as a chaperon for Notch in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for Notch to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we report that O-fut1 has additional functions in the endocytic transportation of Notch. O-fut1 was indispensable for the constitutive transportation of Notch from the plasma membrane to the early endosome, which we show was independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity of O-fut1. We also found that O-fut1 promoted the turnover of Notch, which consequently downregulated Notch signaling. O-fut1 formed a stable complex with the extracellular domain of Notch. In addition, O-fut1 protein added to conditioned medium and endocytosed was sufficient to rescue normal Notch transportation to the early endosome in O-fut1 knockdown cells. Thus, an extracellular interaction between Notch and O-fut1 is essential for the normal endocytic transportation of Notch. We propose that O-fut1 is the first example, except for ligands, of a molecule that is required extracellularly for receptor transportation by endocytosis.</str>

      <str>The C35T mutant α-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene had been reported related to the para-Bombay phenotype, but recently, our laboratory found that the C35T was a polymorphism in the Chinese population. This study aims at further clarifying the property of C35T mutant FUT1.</str>
      <str>The mutant C35T FUT1 gene was cloned into expression vector in vitro, the mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the mutant enzyme's activity was determined in vitro.</str>
      <str>The results showed that the frequencies of 35C and 35T alleles were 0.735 and 0.265, respectively. The FUT1 mRNA level of transfected cells with C35T recombination vector showed 99.85% of the wild-type FUT1 transfected cells. The enzyme relative activity of transfected cell lysates with C35T FUT1 recombination vector was 79.45% compared with that of the wild-type FUT1 transfected cell lysates. The K(m)(phenyl-gal) value of enzyme encoded by C35T allele was 0.5 times higher than that of the enzyme encoded by FUT1 wild-type allele.</str>
      <str>These results suggested that FUT1 C35T was a polymorphism in the Chinese population and did not affect its mRNA transcription, but could slightly decrease the activity of human α-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase in vitro.</str>

      <str>Alpha 1, 2-fucosyltransferase (FUT 1/2) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of Lewis y, a cell membrane-associated carbohydrate antigen. In human ovarian cancer, the upregulated expression of FUT1 and Lewis y is associated with advanced pathological stages and involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the mechanism underlying the upregulation of FUT1 is largely unknown. Here, we identify an AP-1 binding site in FUT1 promoter in ovarian cancer cells. c-Jun promotes FUT1 expression, thereby enhancing Lewis y biosynthesis in various ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, EMSA, luciferase activity and ChIP assays demonstrate c-Jun directly interacts with FUT1 promoter. Furthermore, FUT1 mediates c-Jun-induced cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. In human ovarian cancer samples, c-Jun overexpression is linked to malignant degree and positively correlated to FUT1 and Lewis y expression. Taken together, c-Jun could transcriptionally modulate FUT1 expression in ovarian cancer, implicating the potential application of c-Jun inhibitors for human ovarian cancer therapy. </str>

      <str>The α 1,2-fucosyltransferase I (FUT1) enzyme is important for the biosynthesis of H antigens, Lewis B, and Lewis Y. In this study, we clarified the transcriptional regulation of FUT1 in the DLD-1 colon cancer cell line, which has high expression of Lewis B and Lewis Y antigens, expresses the FUT1 gene, and shows α 1,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT) activity. 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed a FUT1 transcriptional start site -10 nucleotides upstream of the site registered at NM_000148 in the DataBase of Human Transcription Start Sites (DBTSS). Using the dual luciferase assay, FUT1 gene expression was shown to be regulated at the region -91 to -81 nt to the transcriptional start site, which contains the Elk-1 binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of this region revealed the Elk-1 binding site to be essential for FUT1 transcription. Furthermore, transfection of the dominant negative Elk-1 gene, and the chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIp) assay, supported Elk-1-dependent transcriptional regulation of FUT1 gene expression in DLD-1 cells. These results suggest that a defined region in the 5'-flanking region of FUT1 is critical for FUT1 transcription and that constitutive gene expression of FUT1 is regulated by Elk-1 in DLD-1 cells.</str>

      <str>The alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferases (FUT1 and FUT2) contribute to the formation of blood group antigen structures, which are present on cell membranes and in secretions. In the present study we demonstrate that both FUT1 and FUT2 are expressed in the pig small intestine. FUT1 polymorphisms influence adhesion of F18 fimbriated Escherichia coli (ECF18) to intestinal mucosa, and FUT2 is associated with expression of erythrocyte antigen 0. The FUT1 polymorphisms result in amino acid substitutions at positions 103 (Ala--&gt;Thr) and 286 (Arg--&gt;Glu). Tightly controlled expression of the FUT2 gene results in either an abundance or an absence of mRNA in small intestinal mucosa. ECF18-resistant animals were shown to be homozygous for threonine at amino acid 103 of the FUT1 enzyme. Susceptibility to ECF18 adhesion appeared to be solely dependent on the activity of FUT1 in intestinal epithelia. In intestinal mucosae of ECF18-resistant pigs which expressed FUT1 but not FUT2 RNA, the levels of alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity were significantly lower (28- to 45-fold, P&lt;0.001) than in susceptible pigs. Moreover, lysates of CHO cells transfected with FUT1 constructs encoding threonine at amino acid position 103 also showed significantly reduced enzyme activity compared with constructs encoding alanine at this position. Our genetic and enzymatic studies support the hypothesis that the FUT1 enzyme, and particularly the amino acid at position 103, is likely important in the synthesis of a structure that enables adhesion of ECF18 bacteria to small intestinal mucosa.</str>

Heterozygous mutations of FUT1 were identified by TOPO cloning sequencing.

The genetic characteristics of all para-Bombay probands identified in the Fujian Blood Centre, including those in the present study, were also summarised.</str>
      <str>Three FUT1 genotypes, h1/h1 (5 individuals), h1/h6 (1 individual) and h3/h2 (1 individual), and three FUT2 genotypes, Se(357)/Se(357) (5 individuals), Se(357)/Se(357, 385) (1 individual) and Se(357)/Se(357, 716) (1 individual) were observed in seven para-Bombay probands. Among 331 donors, only one individual carried the G716A and 880delTT mutations in heterozygosity; this subjects FUT1 and FUT2 genotypes were H/h2 and Se(357)/Se(357, 716), respectively.</str>

      <str>Arabidopsis thaliana xyloglucan has an XXXG structure, with branches of xylosyl residues, β-D-galacosyl-(1,2)-α-d-xylosyl motifs and fucosylated β-D-galactosyl-(1,2)-α-D-xylosyl motifs. Most of the enzymes involved in xyloglucan biosynthesis in Arabidopsis have been identified, including the glucan synthase CSLC4 (cellulose synthase-like C4), three xylosyltransferases (XXT1, XXT2 and XXT5), two galactosyltransferases (MUR3 and XLT2) and the fucosyltransferase FUT1. The XXTs and CSLC4 form homo- and heterocomplexes and were proposed to co-localize in the same complex, but the organization of the other xyloglucan-synthesizing enzymes remains unclear. Here we investigate whether the glycosyltransferases MUR3, XLT2 and FUT1 interact with the XXT-CSLC4 complexes in the Arabidopsis Golgi. We used co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, with signal quantification by flow cytometry, to demonstrate that CSLC4 interacts with MUR3, XLT2 and FUT1. FUT1 forms homocomplexes and interacts with MUR3, XLT2, XXT2 and XXT5. XLT2 interacts with XXT2 and XXT5, but MUR3 does not. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that FUT1 forms a homocomplex through disulfide bonds, and formation of the heterocomplexes does not involve covalent interactions. In vitro pull-down assays indicated that interactions in the FUT1-MUR3 and FUT1-XXT2 complexes occur through the protein catalytic domains. We propose that enzymes involved in xyloglucan biosynthesis are functionally organized in multiprotein complexes localized in the Golgi.</str>

      <str>Fucosylation regulates various pathological events in cells. We reported that different levels of CRT (calreticulin) affect the cell adhesion and metastasis of bladder cancer. However, the precise mechanism of tumour metastasis regulated by CRT remains unclear. Using a DNA array, we identified FUT1 (fucosyltransferase 1) as a gene regulated by CRT expression levels. CRT regulated cell adhesion through α1,2-linked fucosylation of β1 integrin and this modification was catalysed by FUT1. To clarify the roles for FUT1 in bladder cancer, we transfected the human FUT1 gene into CRT-RNAi stable cell lines. FUT1 overexpression in CRT-RNAi cells resulted in increased levels of β1 integrin fucosylation and rescued cell adhesion to type-I collagen. Treatment with UEA-1 (Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1), a lectin that recognizes FUT1-modified glycosylation structures, did not affect cell adhesion. In contrast, a FUT1-specific fucosidase diminished the activation of β1 integrin. These results indicated that α1,2-fucosylation of β1 integrin was not involved in integrin-collagen interaction, but promoted β1 integrin activation. Moreover, we demonstrated that CRT regulated FUT1 mRNA degradation at the 3'-UTR. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that CRT stabilized FUT1 mRNA, thereby leading to an increase in fucosylation of β1 integrin. Furthermore, increased fucosylation levels activate β1 integrin, rather than directly modifying the integrin-binding sites. </str>

      <str>We previously reported that sialyl Lewis(y), synthesized by fucosyltransferases, is involved in angiogenesis. Fucosyltransferase 1 (fut1) is an α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase responsible for synthesis of the H blood group and Lewis(y) antigens. However, the angiogenic involvement of fut 1 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue (RA ST) has not been clearly defined.</str>
      <str>Assay of α(1,2)-linked fucosylated proteins in RA was performed by enzyme-linked lectin assay. Fut1 expression was determined in RA ST samples by immunohistological staining. We performed angiogenic Matrigel assays using a co-culture system of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) and fut1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfected RA synovial fibroblasts. To determine if fut1 played a role in leukocyte retention and cell proliferation in the RA synovium, myeloid THP-1 cell adhesion assays and fut1 siRNA transfected RA synovial fibroblast proliferation assays were performed.</str>
      <str>Total α(1,2)-linked fucosylated proteins in RA ST were significantly higher compared to normal (NL) ST. Fut1 expression on RA ST lining cells positively correlated with ST inflammation. HMVECs from a co-culture system with fut1 siRNA transfected RA synovial fibroblasts exhibited decreased endothelial cell tube formation compared to control siRNA transfected RA synovial fibroblasts. Fut1 siRNA also inhibited myeloid THP-1 adhesion to RA synovial fibroblasts and RA synovial fibroblast proliferation.</str>
      <str>These data show that α(1,2)-linked fucosylated proteins are upregulated in RA ST compared to NL ST. We also show that fut1 in RA synovial fibroblasts is important in angiogenesis, leukocyte-synovial fibroblast adhesion, and synovial fibroblast proliferation, all key processes in the pathogenesis of RA.</str>

      <str>Escherichia coli (E. coli) that produces adhesin F18 is the main pathogen responsible for porcine post-weaning diarrhea and edema disease. The receptor for E. coli F18 has not been described in pigs, however the alpha (1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene on chromosome 6 has been proposed as a candidate. The objective of this study, therefore, was to investigate the relationship between FUT1 gene expression and E. coli F18 receptor in Sutai pigs of different ages (8-, 18-, 30- and 35-day-old). FUT1 gene expression was detected in 11 pig tissues with the highest level in lung, and expressed consistently at the four time points. In most tissues, FUT1 gene expression levels decreased from days 8 to 18, then continually increased on days 30 and 35, with expression around weaning time higher than that on day 8. Gene ontology and pathway analysis showed that FUT1 was involved in 32 biological processes, mainly those integral to the membrane, or involved in glycosylation, as well as regulation of binding, interestingly participating in three pathways related to glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. From this analysis and the high linkage disequilibrium between the FUT1 gene and the E. coli F18 receptor locus, we can speculate that higher expression of the FUT1 gene in small intestine is beneficial to the formation of receptors to the E. coli F18 strain and is related to the sensitivity to the pathogen.</str>

      <str>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F18 is a major pathogen that causes postweaning diarrhoea and edema disease in piglets. The alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been identified as an ideal candidate gene for controlling the expression of the receptor for ECF18 bacteria. Therefore, the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to study the function of the FUT1 gene and to produce FUT1 knockdown transgenic pig would be highly beneficial. We developed an effective strategy for the expression of multiple small hairpin RNA simultaneously using multiple RNA polymerase III (hU6, hH1, mU6 and h7SK) promoters in a single vector to knockdown the FUT1 gene. Stable FUT1 knockdown transgenic fibroblast lines were generated by transfecting porcine fetal fibroblasts with the constructed vectors. Real-time RT-PCR indicated that the mRNA level of FUT1 in the transgenic fibroblast lines was significantly lower than that in the control, as much as 29 %. Finally, we successfully obtained transgenic SCNT porcine embryos. Overall, the results demonstrated that this vector-based RNAi expression system is an efficient approach to knockdown FUT1 gene expression in porcine fetal fibroblast cells, which could thereby provide donor cells for somatic cell nuclear cloning and the potential production of a marker-free transgenic pig resistant to F18 related diseases. Furthermore, it also provides strong evidence that this approach could be useful both in the production of transgenic livestock resistant to disease, and in the development of effective strategies for the suppression of gene expression in clinical gene therapy.</str>

      <str>Lewis Y (LeY) antigen is an oligosaccharide that is highly expressed at             the cell surface in various human cancers. Increased LeY expression activates             epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor             2 (HER2) and promotes cell proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing cells. However,             the effect of downregulation of LeY expression on cell proliferation in HER2-overexpressing             cells remains unknown. FUT1 encodes α1,2-fucosyltransferase, a key enzyme for             LeY synthesis. We knocked down FUT1 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in four HER2-overexpressing             human cancer cell lines, including NCI-N87, MKN7, SKBr3 and BT474. We investigated             whether downregulation of LeY and alteration in the glycosylation status of these             cells affect cell proliferation and HER2 activation. Knocking down FUT1 expression             markedly inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87, which highly expressed EGFR and was             sensitive to EGFR deprivation. Furthermore, FUT1 siRNA downregulated the total             amount of HER2 protein, phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR, and phosphorylation             of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in this cell line. Moreover, the             marked downregulation of phosphorylation of HER2 and ERK was observed following             short-time EGF-stimulation. These effects were not observed in the other three             cell lines. Our results suggest that knockdown of FUT1 downregulates HER2 signaling             via EGFR downregulation. FUT1 may serve as a new molecular target for HER2-overexpressing             human cancers with activated EGFR signaling.</str>

Until now, there are no data demonstrating the direct implication of specific glycosyltransferases in the specific patterns of apomucin glycosylation. HT29/M3 colon cancer cell line express MUC1, MUC5AC, type 1 Lewis antigens and FUT2 but not type 2 structures and FUT1, as it occurs in the epithelial cells of the gastric superficial epithelium. These cells were transfected with the cDNA of human FUT1, the alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of type 2 Lewis antigens, to assess the implication of FUT1 in the glycosylation of MUC1 and MUC5AC. The M3-FUT1 clones obtained express high levels of type 2 Lewis antigens: H type 2 and Ley antigens. Immunoprecipitation of MUC1 and MUC5AC apomucins gives the direct evidence that FUT1 catalyses the addition of alpha-1,2-fucose to these apomucins, supporting the hypothesis that the pattern of apomucin glycosylation is not only instructed by the mucin primary sequence but also by the set of glycosyltransferases expressed in each specific cell type.</str>

The genetic variations in the position of M307 nucleotide in open reading frame of FUT1 have been proposed as a marker for selecting ETEC F18 resistant pigs. The polymorphisms of M307 in FUT1 of breeding base group for ETEC F18 resistance of Sutai pigs (Duroc × Meishan) was detected and their correlations to some immune indexes, growth and development ability, carcass traits and meat quality were also analyzed, which aimed to investigate feasibility of further breeding for diseases resistance based on M307 of FUT1 for Sutai pigs. After digested by Hin6 I, M307 of FUT1 gene could be divided into three kinds of genotypes, AA, AG, and GG. The frequencies were 0.235, 0.609, and 0.156, respectively. The results indicated that Sutai pigs with the AA genotype in M307 of FUT1 gene not only have relatively strong general disease resistance ability in piglets, but also have higher growth and development ability and stable carcass traits and meat quality.

      <str>Lewis Y (LeY) antigen is highly expressed in a variety of human carcinomas of epithelial cell origin. Recent studies suggest functional blockade of LeY may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers. However, suppressing LeY expression by genetic manipulation and its impact on neoplastic cell proliferation has not been investigated. We report here that different fucosyltransferases (FUTs) were expressed with the greatest expression of fucosyltransferase I or IV (FUT1/4), the two key enzymes for the synthesis of LeY in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Knocking down FUT1/4 expression by short interfering RNA technique dramatically reduced the expression of FUT1/4 and LeY and inhibited cell proliferation through decreasing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Treatment of A431 cells that were inoculated into the nude mice with FUT1 siRNA or FUT4 siRNA greatly impeded tumor growth. Suppressing FUT1/4 expression also blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In conclusion, suppressing the expression of FUT1/4 by RNAi technology reduces the synthesis of LeY and inhibits cancer growth. It may serve as a potential methodology for the treatment of cancers that express LeY glycoconjugates.</str>

      <str>Notch (N) is a transmembrane receptor that mediates the cell-cell interactions necessary for many cell fate decisions. N has many epidermal growth factor-like repeats that are O-fucosylated by the protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (O-Fut1), and the O-fut1 gene is essential for N signaling. However, the role of the monosaccharide O-fucose on N is unclear, because O-Fut1 also appears to have O-fucosyltransferase activity-independent functions, including as an N-specific chaperon. Such an enzymatic activity-independent function could account for the essential role of O-fut1 in N signaling. To evaluate the role of the monosaccharide O-fucose modification in N signaling, here we generated a knock-in mutant of O-fut1 (O-fut1(R245A knock-in)), which expresses a mutant protein that lacks O-fucosyltransferase activity but maintains the N-specific chaperon activity. Using O-fut1(R245A knock-in) and other gene mutations that abolish the O-fucosylation of N, we found that the monosaccharide O-fucose modification of N has a temperature-sensitive function that is essential for N signaling. The O-fucose monosaccharide and O-glucose glycan modification, catalyzed by Rumi, function redundantly in the activation of N signaling. We also showed that the redundant function of these two modifications is responsible for the presence of N at the cell surface. Our findings elucidate how different forms of glycosylation on a protein can influence the protein's functions. </str>

M., de la Llera-Moya, M., Xu, X., and Greene, M. I. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 107, 732-737). We performed a series of co-transfections using mammalian expression vectors encoding specific glycosyltransferases. We thereby identified branching enzymes and FUT1 (required for Fucα1→2Gal linkage) as being essential for F77 antigen formation. When immortalized normal prostate 267B1 cells were transfected with FUT1 alone, cells showed weak expression of F77 antigen. By contrast, cells co-transfected with FUT1 plus either GCNT1, GCNT2, or GCNT3 (an enzyme required to form GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc) showed robust F77 antigen expression, suggesting that F77 specifically binds to Fucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc. RT-PCR for FUT1, GCNT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed that F77-positive cell lines indeed express transcripts encoding FUT1 plus one GCNT. F77-positive prostate cancer cells transfected with siRNAs targeting FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed significantly reduced F77 antigen, confirming the requirement of these enzymes for epitope synthesis. We also found that hypoxia induces F77 epitope expression in immortalized prostate RWPE1 cells, which express F77 antigen moderately under normoxia but at an elevated level under hypoxia. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated up-regulation of FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 transcripts in RWPE1 cells under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia up-regulates glycosyltransferase expression required for F77 antigen synthesis. These results define the F77 epitope and provide a potential mechanism for F77 antigen synthesis in malignant prostate cancer. </str>

      <str>The Bombay phenotype fails to express the ABH antigens of ABO blood group system on red blood cells and in secretions because of a lack in activities of the H gene (FUT1)- and Secretor gene (FUT2)-encoded alpha (1,2)fucosyltransferases. In this study, we have examined the FUT1 and the FUT2 from three unrelated Indian individuals with the Bombay phenotype. These three individuals were found to be homozygous for a T725G mutation in the coding region of the FUT1, which inactivated the enzyme activity. In addition, we did not detect any hybridized band corresponding to the FUT2 by Southern blot analysis using the catalytic domain of the FUT2 as a probe, indicating that the three individuals were homozygous for a gene deletion in the FUT2. These results suggest that the T725G mutation of FUT1 and the gene deletion of FUT2 are responsible for the classical Indian Bombay phenotype.</str>

      <str>This study was aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms for para-Bombay blood type individual in Fujian Province of China. The para-Bombay blood type of this individual was identified by routine serological techniques. The full coding region of alpha (1,2) fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene of this individual was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), then the PCR product was cloned into T vector. The mutation in coding region of fut1 gene was identified by TA cloning, so as to explore the molecular mechanisms for para-Bombay blood type individual. The results indicated that the full coding region of fut1 gene was successfully amplified by PCR. AG deletion at position 547-552 on 2 homologous chromosomes was detected by TA cloning method, leading to a reading frame shift and a premature stop codon. It is concluded that genetic mutation of fut1 gene in this para-bombay blood type individual was h1h1 homozygotic type.</str>

      <str>The α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity in pancreatic tumors is much lower compared to normal pancreatic tissue. Here we show that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α is constitutively expressed in the pancreatic cancer cell lines Pa-Tu-8988S and Pa-Tu-8988T and suppresses the expression of the α1,2-fucosyltransferase genes FUT1 and FUT2. Down regulation of HIF-1α expression resulted in elevated FUT1 and FUT2 transcript levels and an increased expression of α1,2-fucosylated glycan structures on the surface of these cells. In conclusion, our data are the first to identify HIF-1α as a suppressor of FUT1/2 expression, thereby regulating α1,2-fucosylation of cell-surface glycans. </str>

      <str>Fucosyl GM1 has been reported to be specifically expressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. However, the genetic basis for the synthesis of fucosyl GM1 has not been investigated. We analyzed the glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of fucosyl GM1 in SCLC cell lines. In four SCLC cell lines expressing fucosyl GM1, both FUT1 and FUT2 mRNAs were detected, indicating that either one or both of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferases may be involved in the expression of fucosyl GM1. However, three of these four lines contained function-loss mutations in the FUT2 coding region, suggesting that FUT1 is mainly involved in the alpha1,2-fucosylation of GM1. The expression levels of the GM1 synthase gene showed no correlation with those of fucosyl GM1, whereas the co-transfection of GM1 synthase cDNA with FUT1 or FUT2 into SK-LC-17 clearly enhanced the neo-expression of fucosyl GM1, indicating its essential role. In contrast, the co-transfection of GD3 synthase cDNA reduced the expression levels of fucosyl GM1 with FUT1 or FUT2. Consequently, FUT1 seems to mainly contribute to the expression of fucosyl GM1, although both FUT1 and FUT2 are capable of generating the antigen. These results should promote the functional analysis of fucosyl GM1 leading to the development of novel therapies for SCLC.</str>

      <str>The para-Bombay phenotype of the nine Chinese probands was identified by standard serologic techniques. The coding regions of FUT1 and FUT2 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. ABO genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific priming method. The FUT1 and FUT2 genotypes and the distribution in all reported Chinese para-Bombay individuals including our study were also summarized.</str>

      <str>The para-Bombay phenotype is characterized by H-deficient or H-partially deficient red blood cells (RBCs) in persons who secrete ABH antigens in their saliva. The studies that determined the genotypes for two Chinese individuals with the para-Bombay phenotype are described.</str>
      <str>RBC phenotypes were characterized by conventional serologic methods. Exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene were amplified, as well as the entire coding region for FUT1 and FUT2, with four independence polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) from genomic DNA. PCR products were excised, purified from agarose gels, and sequenced directly. Mutations of FUT1 were identified by TOPO cloning sequencing.</str>
      <str>For both individuals, RBC ABO genotypes correlated with ABH substances in their saliva. One individual (a patient) had two heterozygous mutations of FUT1 by direct DNA sequencing, namely, a C--&gt;T heterozygous mutation at position 293(C293T) and AG heterozygous deletion (CAGAGAG--&gt;CAGAG) at position 547 to 552. These two mutations were confirmed to be compound heterozygotes; that is, each mutation was determined to be on a separate homologous chromosome by TOPO cloning sequencing. The FUT2 genotype was Se(357)Se(357). The other individual (a blood donor) had an AG deletion at position 547 to 552 homozygous allele in FUT1. The FUT2 genotype was Se(357)Se(357,385). C293T mutation can cause Thr/Met at amino acid position 98. AG deletion at position 547 to 552 caused a reading frameshift and a premature stop codon.</str>

      <str>In a previous article, we demonstrated the existence of fucosyl-containing O-glycans forms of nucleolin in bovine post-capillary venular endothelial cells (CVEC) and malignant cultured human A431 cells. The tool for this discovery was an antibody found to interact strongly and exclusively with nucleolin in total protein extracts. The antibody was originally raised against a mollusc glycoprotein and was demonstrated to be directed against its O-glycans, recently found to belong prevalently to the blood group H-antigen type with fucose linked in alpha1, 2 to galactose. Here, we show that si-RNA induced down-regulation of the expression of FUT1 and FUT2, the fucosyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of the terminal glycan motif Fucalpha-2-Galbeta-R, reduced expression of the fucosylated nucleolin glycoforms and their exposure at the cell surface in CVEC. Treatment of the cells with FUT1/2 siRNA also reduced their ability to bind and internalize endostatin and their adhesion efficiency and inhibited cell growth. Expression of FUT1, FUT2, and FUT6 was also analyzed in serum-stimulated versus serum-starved cells and in cells treated with FUT1 and FUT2 siRNA. A reduced expression of fucosylated nucleolin and inhibition of cell growth by suppressing FUT1/2 expression was also tested and shown to be exhibited in human A431 cells.</str>

      <str>Six human alpha-L-fucosyltransferase genes have been registered in the GDB as FUT1 to FUT6 according to the chronology of their description. FUT1 and FUT2 encode the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferases H and Se respectively. The FUT2 gene has not been cloned, but it is expected to be closely linked to FUT1 on the long arm of chromosome 19. FUT3, FUT4, FUT5 and FUT6 encode different alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferases which share between 60 and 90% homology with each other, but none with FUT1. Missense and nonsense point mutations have been found to inactivate the cognate enzymes of FUT1, FUT3 and FUT6. FUT3 and FUT6 are closely linked on the short arm of chromosome 19 and encode the Lewis and plasma enzymes respectively. The FUT5 gene has been cloned and sequenced, but its tissue expression has not been defined as yet. FUT4 has been mapped to 11q21 and encodes a monomorphic myeloid enzyme. All but FUT4 are genetically polymorphic. The deficient alleles of FUT1 and FUT6 have a very low incidence and they have been found mainly around the Indian Ocean. A myeloid enzyme is present in 5 to 10 week old human embryos and is later progressively replaced by different patterns of adult fucosyltransferase enzymes in all tissues, except in leukocytes and brain which continue to express a FUT4 like enzyme in the adult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Rare individuals (Bombay and para-Bombay phenotypes) fail to express the A, B and H antigens on erythrocyte membranes because of a lack in the H gene (FUT1)-encoded alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity. In this study, we have found a para-Bombay individual (Bmh) who expressed B and H antigens in saliva but not on red blood cells. The FUT1 alleles of this person contained two single base changes (T460C and G1042A) in the coding region relative to the wild type allele. These substitutions may result in changes in two amino acid residues (Y154H and E348K).</str>
      <str>Since the T460C and G1042A mutations destroy endonuclease RsaI and AvaI sites, respectively, we tested for these mutations using PCR-RFLP.</str>
      <str>Our findings indicated that this para-Bombay person was homozygous for the T460C and G1042A mutations, and that neither of these mutations was found in 136 randomly selected Japanese individuals. The measurement of the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity after transient expression of the FUT1 alleles in COS-7 cells indicated that the H-deficient allele-encoded enzyme had no detectable activity. Moreover, transfection by chimera FUT1 allele contains only the T460C mutation, or only the G1042A mutation, and yielded 1.0 or 9.3%, respectively, of the activities compared to transfection by the wild type allele.</str>

ABO and H phenotypes of the proband were identified by serological techniques. The exon 6 to exon 7 of ABO gene and full coding region of α-1,2-fucosyltransferase (fut1) gene of the proband were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the amplified fragments. The haplotype of compound heterozygote of fut1 was also identified by cloning sequencing. The results indicated that a rare para-Bombay phenotype was confirmed by serological techniques. Two deletion or insertion variant sites near nucleotide 547 and 880 were detected in fut1 gene. The results of cloning sequence showed that one haplotype of fut1 gene was two bases deletion at 547-552 (AGAGAG→AGAG), and another one was two bases deletion at position 880-882 (TTT→T). Both two variants caused a reading frame shift and a premature stop codon. It is concluded that a rare para-Bombay phenotype is found and confirmed in blood donor population. The molecular basis of this individual is compound heterozygote of two bases deletion on fut1 gene which weaken the activity of α-1, 2-fucosyltransferase.</str>

      <str>Recent studies have suggested that at least three transcription-initiation sites were present in the human H-type alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1). In the present study, we have investigated these transcription start sites of FUT1 in undifferentiated leukemic cells (K562) that have erythroid characteristics, in erythroleukemia cells (HEL), and in bone marrow cells. K562 cells used exclusively exon 1 as the start site. While HEL cells used mainly exon 2 as the start site, the major start site for bone marrow cells was within exon 7. In addition, we investigated the transcription start site(s) in vascular endothelial cells (ECV304) as an example of mature cells and found that the start site was predominantly within exon 7. The promoter activities were found in the 5' flanking regions of these three start sites after transfection of constructs with luciferase reporter gene into K562 and HEL cells. These findings suggested that the transcription start sites of FUT1 changed during differentiation of the erythroid lineage and that the tissue-specific and stage-specific expressions of the FUT1 were regulated by three distinct promoters. We also found that the 5' flanking region of exon 2 (intron 1) consisted of repetitive sequences (chromosome 19-specific 37-bp minisatellite repeats, Alu sequence and long terminal repeat) and that the start site of exon 2 was within the long terminal repeat. Thus, these repetitive sequences may play a role in the expression of the FUT1.</str>

      <str>The H epitope, an alpha(1-2)fucosylated carbohydrate structure, has been implicated in initial attachment of the murine blastocyst to luminal uterine epithelial cells in vitro. In this study, the expression of the H-type alpha(1-2)fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene was examined in endometrium of mice. Northern blotting of luminal epithelial RNA identified a single 6.2-kilobase transcript. In situ hybridization studies showed a signal for FUT1 mRNA on Days 1-3 of pregnancy in glands and luminal epithelium. The signal diminished by Day 4 and could not be detected on Day 5 of pregnancy. The in situ signal in endometrial epithelia was highest at estrus and metestrus and was absent at diestrus. Estrogen treatment after ovariectomy gave strong FUT1 mRNA expression in epithelia, but with progesterone, progesterone + estrogen, or vehicle, no message could be detected. A semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of FUT1 mRNA from luminal epithelium generated large amounts of PCR product on Day 1 of pregnancy; this diminished on Days 2, 3, and 4, and the product was barely detectable on Day 5. A kinetic analysis of FUT1 activity on Day 1 of pregnancy suggested a single enzyme with a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 0.29 mM towards phenyl-beta-D-galactoside and of 1.75 mM towards Galbeta(1-3)GalNAc. These results suggest that expression of the H epitope is regulated at the level of FUT1 transcription and that transcription is stimulated by estrogen in the endometrial epithelium.</str>

      <str>Escherichia coli F18 (ECF18) is a common porcine enteric pathogen. The pathogenicity of ECF18 bacteria depends on the existence of ECF18 receptor in the brush border membranes of piglet's small intestinal mucosa. Alpha (1) fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1) has been identified as the candidate gene controlling the adhesion to ECF18 receptor. The genetic variations in the position of M307 nucleotide in open reading frame of FUT1 have been proposed as a marker for selecting resistant pigs. The piglets were divided into three groups, AA, AG and GG, according to the genotypes present at M307 of FUT1. Small intestinal epithelium cells of piglets with AA, AG and GG genotypes were selected to test the adhesion capability of the wild type E.coli expressing F18ab fimbriae, the recombinant E. coli expressing F18ac fimbriae or the recombinant E. coli secreting and surface-displaying the FedF subunit of F18ab fimbriae, respectively. Here, we examined the distribution and expression of porcine FUT1 mRNA in different tissues in Sutai pigs using real-time PCR. The results showed that piglets with AA genotype show resistance, whereas piglets with GG or AG genotypes are sensitive to the pathogenic E. coli F18 in Sutai piglets. FUT1 was expressed in all the tissues that were examined, and the gene's expression was highest in the lungs. There was no significant difference in expression level among the three genotypes in the liver, lung, stomach and duodenum, where the gene expression was relatively high. The present analysis suggested that mutation at M307 in FUT1 gene determines susceptibility of small intestinal epithelium to E. coli F18 adhesion in Sutai piglet and the expression of FUT1 gene may be regulated by other factors or the mutation was likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with some cis-regulatory variants.</str>

      <str>This study aims to provide a theoretical basis on the regulatory mechanism of the α-l,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene in pigs by analyzing the transcriptional activity of its promoter region. On the basis of the previously obtained promoter sequence, primers upstream and downstream of the gene were designed using the restriction endonucleases KpnI and HindIII respectively, and the recombinant plasmids of the pGL3-promoter were constructed by inserting promoter sequences with partially missing regions. The resultant mutants were observed by transient transfection assay into HEK293 cells, and the transcriptional activity of the promoter region was determined by luciferase activity. The 5'-flanking region of the FUT1 gene (-1150 to +50 bp) exhibited promoter activity. The -1150-bp to -849-bp region showed negative regulation of the gene. The recombinant plasmid pGL3-898 showed the strongest luciferase activity, and the activity showed a decreasing trend when the deleted region was increased.

      <str>Lewis antigens are terminal fucosylated oligosaccharides synthesized by the sequential action of several glycosyltransferases. The fucosyltransferases are the enzymes responsible for the addition of terminal fucose to precursor oligosaccharides attached to proteins or lipids. These oligosaccharides, defined as cell surface markers, have been implicated in different types of intercellular interactions and in adhesion and invasion processes. Transfection of HT-29/M3 colon cancer cells with the full length of human fucosyltransferase (FUT1), induces the synthesis of H type 2 and Lewis y antigens, associated with a decrease of sialyl-Lewis x. The capacity to develop primary tumors when cells were injected intrasplenically was similar in parental and FUT1-transfected cells, but the capacity to colonize the liver after spleen removal was significantly reduced in M3/FUT1 transfected cells. These results indicate that the expression of FUT1 induces changes in the metastatic capacity of HT-29/M3 colon cancer cells, as a consequence of the altered expression pattern of type 2 Lewis antigens. Also, an association between MUC5AC expression and the degree of gland differentiation in both primary splenic tumors and hepatic metastases was detected.</str>

      <str>The determination of genetic variability by means of molecular genetic markers FUT1 and ESR2, and the evaluation of their associations with reproduction traits in population of Prestice Black-Pied sows have been implemented. A lower frequency of the allele FUT1A than the frequency of the allele FUT1G in the FUT1 gene was ascertained. In the ESR2 polymorphism, a higher frequency of the allele ESR2A compared with the allele ESR2B was determined. In the second to sixth litters as well as in the first to sixth litters, a significantly lower number of piglets born alive and number of weaned piglets from sows of the FUT1/IFUT1A genotype was found. Moreover, the homozygotes FUT1G /FUT1G significantly exceeded sows of the FUT1A/FUT1A genotype in the total number of born piglets in the first to sixth litters.

We also evaluated the FUT1 genotypes of 190 healthy pigs from three different genetic backgrounds. The distribution of genotypes differed between the successfully marketed and disease affected/deceased pig groups. The frequency of the A allele, associated with resistance to edema and post-weaning diarrhea, was higher in the post-weaning survival group (0.21) than in the non-survival group (0.16, P &lt; 0.05). The odds ratio for piglet survival between AA and GG genotypes was 1.98; thus, piglet survival for individuals with the AA genotype was almost two-fold greater than for GG individuals.

      <str>The fucose alpha(1--&gt;2) galactose beta structure is expressed by uterine epithelial cells in the mouse and has been implicated in blastocyst adhesion events thought to be required for murine implantation. Fucalpha(1--&gt;2)Galbeta moieties and cognate fucosyltransferases are also expressed by epithelial cells of the male reproductive tract and have been implicated in sperm maturation events that may contribute to fertilization. To determine directly if Fucalpha(1--&gt;2)Galbeta moieties are required for fertility, we have generated strains of mice that are deficient in genes encoding FUT1 and FUT2, a pair of GDP-L-fucose:beta(1--&gt;4)-D-galactosyl-R 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase enzymes (EC 2.4.1.69) responsible for Fucalpha(1--&gt;2)Galbeta synthesis and expression. FUT1 null mice and FUT2 null mice develop normally and exhibit no gross phenotypic abnormalities. The Fucalpha(1--&gt;2)Galbeta epitope is absent from the uterine epithelia of FUT2 null mice and from the epithelia of the epididymis of FUT1 null mice. Fully normal fertility is observed in FUT1 null intercrosses and in FUT2 null intercrosses. These observations indicate that Fucalpha(1--&gt;2)Galbeta moieties are not essential to blastocyst-uterine epithelial cell interactions required for implantation and are not required for sperm maturation events that permit fertilization and that neither the FUT loci nor their cognate fucosylated glycans are essential to normal development.</str>

      <str>Terminal Fucalpha(1-2)Galbeta epitopes have been proposed to play significant roles in cell-cell interactions in development, cell adhesion, and malignant transformation. To begin to investigate the regulation and function of alpha(1-2)fucosylated epitopes in an animal model, we have isolated and characterized a mouse genomic DNA segment encoding a protein orthologous to the human H blood group locus alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase (FUT1). This segment maintains an open reading frame encoding 376 amino acids sharing 75% sequence identity with the enzyme encoded by human FUT1, and 55% sequence identity with the enzyme encoded by the human Secretor blood group locus (FUT2). Expression of the open reading frame in COS-7 cells yields an alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity with a Km of 7.6 mM for phenyl-beta-d-galactoside. Southern blotting and interspecific backcross analyses indicate that this murine locus represents a single copy sequence mapping to a novel locus 2.1 centimorgans from the Klk1 locus, in a region of homology between mouse chromosome 7 and the human FUT1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 19. Mouse FUT1 yields a 2.8 kb mRNA transcript identifiable in many organs, including thymus, lung, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, colon, uterus and epidiymis. Hybridization analyses in situ localize expression of FUT1 transcripts to thymic medullary and epididymal epithelial cells, implying that this gene determines the expression of cell surface Fucalpha(1-2)Galbeta epitopes in these tissues.</str>

These three mutations were rare sequence variations, each with an allele frequency of less than 0.005. Phe174 might be functionally important because this residue is conserved from mouse to human. Their FUT2 genotypes were Se357se357,385 for the h2h6 individual and Se357Se357) for the others. Both FUT2 alleles were known: one functional (Se357) and one weakly functional (se357,385). That they carried at least one copy of a functional FUT2 allele was consistent with their secretor status.

      <str>Alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been identified as a candidate gene for regulating the expression of Escherichia coli F18 receptor gene (ECF18R) which promotes adherence of Enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and Verotoxigenic (VTEC) Escherichia coli (E. coli) via F18 fimbriae. In order to illustrate the polymorphisms of FUT1 and their effects on resistance to natural infection by Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Symdrome Virus (PRRSV) and Haemophilus parasuis, the distributions of different genotypes and the relative risks of disease incidence in pigs were investigated. A total of 1,041 pigs representing three European breeds (Duroc, Landrace and LargeWhite), five Chinese local breeds (Wild pig, Small MeiShan, QinPing, JinHua, and JianLi) and three commercial populations (LargeWhite × JianLi, Duroc × Landrace × LargeWhite and Duroc × wild pig) were selected to analyze the genotype of the FUT1 gene by PCR-RFLP. Only the GG genotype associated with susceptibility to ECF18 bacteria was detected in Chinese local pig breeds and a population of LargeWhite × JianLi, while the AA genotype which confers resistance to ECF18 was detected in two European breeds (Duroc and LargeWhite), two populations of Duroc × wild pig and Duroc × Landrace × LargeWhite. Regarding relative risk of incidence, Duroc × Landrace × LargeWhite with genotypes GG or AG showed greater relative risk (OR = 2.040, P = 0.025; OR = 1.750, P = 0.081, respectively) than those with genotype AA during natural infection by both PRRSV and Haemophilus parasuis. It can be concluded that the mutation of FUT1 gene might play a role in pig infection by multi-pathogens, and that AA may be a favourable genotype for increasing the resistance to disease.</str>

      <str>Five on the seven cloned human fucosyltransferase genes have been mapped to two clusters, one on 19q and the other on 19p. Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed the Généthon microsatellite D19S596 lies 2.2 kb downstream of the coding region of FUT1, indicating that the cluster comprising the closely linked FUT1 and FUT2 genes is located 4 cM distal to D19S412 (lod score 13.7) and 9 cM proximal to D19S571 (lod score 11.7). Polymorphic markers of FUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 were used for linkage analysis with 14 Généthon microsatellites in Indonesian families. These three loci constitute a cluster on 19p, located between the Généthon microsatellites D19S216 and D19S567, which are known to be only 1 cM distant from each other. Two cross-overs, one between FUT6 and FUT3 and the other between FUT3 and FUT5, suggest the gene order 19pter-D19S216-FUT6-FUT3-FUT5-D19S567++ +-cen. Comparison of genetic and physical maps suggests that the FUT6-FUT3-FUT5 cluster is located on 19p13.3 and the FUT1-FUT2 cluster on 19q13.3. FUT6, FUT3 and FUT5 genes share more than 85% homology and encode three similar, but distinct alpha(1,3) fucosyltransferases. FUT1 and FUT2 share about 70% homology and encode two distinct alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferases. No sequence homology was found between the genes of the two clusters. The members of each of these two clusters have probably emerged by duplication and divergent evolution of two unrelated ancestor genes.</str>

      <str>During the initiation of tumor associated angiogenesis endothelial cells migrate, adhere to extracellular matrix and form cell-cell contacts. Humoral factors of malignant cells conduct this process. We investigated whether cell surface expression of the carbohydrate blood group determinant Lewis(y) (CD174) and its precursor structure H2 (CD173) on endothelial cells is influenced by soluble factors of tumor cells. Using a bone marrow derived endothelial cell line we observed an enhanced expression of CD173/CD174 and transcription of FUT1, the key enzyme for their synthesis, after treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or conditioned supernatants of the leukemia cell line KG1a. CD173/CD174 are concentrated on pseudopodial extensions responsible for initial contacts between endothelial cells. Endothelial migration induced by TNF-alpha could be diminished by antibodies to CD174 as well as by siRNA induced downmodulation of FUT1 transcription. Endothelial FUT1-siRNA-transfectants displayed impaired in vitro angiogenesis when cultivated on extracellular matrix and in spheroid assays. In vivo upregulation of CD174 expression was observed immunocytologically in capillaries of tumor-infiltrated tissue. Together, our observations point to a tumor induced transcription of endothelial FUT1 and consequently an enhanced expression of CD174 which is involved in migration and early cell-cell contacts during tumor associated angiogenesis.</str>

One cosmid has been isolated that contains two distinct segments that cross-hybridize with FUT1. We have assembled a 100-kilobase (kb) cosmid contig, localized to 19q13.3, encompassing FUT1 and the two FUT1-related sequences, termed Sec1 and Sec2, for Secretor candidate 1 and 2. Sec1 and Sec2 are separated by 12 kb and are 65.5 kb and 35 kb apart, respectively, from the FUT1 gene. We used a cosmid-dependent direct cDNA selection method to clone a cDNA corresponding to a transcript that emanates from Sec2. This cDNA detects a 3.35-kb transcript in human tissues known to express the Se locus. Together with sequence and expression data reported in the accompanying article (Kelly, R. J., Rouquier, S., Giorgi, D., Lennon, G. G., and Lowe, J. B. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4640-4649), these data demonstrate that Sec2 corresponds to the human Se blood group locus (FUT2).

The genetic variations at position 307 nucleotide in open reading frame of FUT1 gene in 26 pig breeds (total 1458 individuals) from 5 western commercial pig breeds and 21 Chinese native pig breeds were investigated by PCR-RFLP. The results showed that the genetic polymorphisms of the FUT1 locus were only detected in 5 western pig breeds and the Chinese Lingao pig breed, 5 western pig breeds possessed 3 different genotypes, and Lingao pig breed had two susceptible genotypes GG and AG, while all the other 20 Chinese native pig breeds only presented the susceptible genotype GG. The results indicated that if M307G-A point mutation in the coding region of FUT1 gene was the key factor determining the expression of the ECF18 receptor, most of Chinese native pig breeds were absent of the genetic background on the resistance to ECF18 bacteria. In this case, it was inferred that the resistance gene to ECF18 might be originated from western pig breeds. In addition, it is of great importance for the conservation of Lingao pig breed as it is the only found Chinese native pig breed possessing resistance M307A allele in FUT1 gene. Generally, compared with exotic pig breeds, Chinese native pig breeds have stronger resistance to edema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. The results suggested that further study should be done to identify and characterize putative QTL (quantitative trait locus) or/and the functional gene responsible for the resistance to ECF18 in Chinese native pig breeds.</str>

      <str>During inflammation, E- and P-selectins appear on activated endothelial cells to interact with leukocytes through sialyl-Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis a antigens (sLe(x/a)). These selectins can also interact with tumor cells in a sialyl-Lewis-dependent manner and for this reason, they are thought to play a key role in metastasis. Diverting the biosynthesis of sialyl-Lewis antigens toward nonadhesive structures is an attractive gene therapy for preventing the hematogenous metastatic spread of cancers. We have previously shown that transfection of alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase-I (FUT1) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells had a slight effect on the overall sialylation while the synthesis of sLE(x) was dramatically prevented. We herein delivered the gene of FUT1 by a human immunodeficiency virus-derived lentiviral vector to three human cancer cell lines including pancreatic (BxPC3), hepatic (HepG2), and colonic (HT-29) cancer cells. We found that on FUT1 transduction, all cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in sLe(x) synthesis with a concomitant increase in Le(y) and Le(b) expression, without any detectable effect on the level of cell surface sLe(a) antigens. In parallel, FUT1-transduced HT-29 and HepG2 cells, but not BxPC3 cells, failed to interact with E-selectin as assessed by E-selectin-binding assay or dynamic adhesion to activated endothelial cells. We show also that transduced FUT1 efficiently fucosylates the P-selectin ligand PSGL-1 without altering P-selectin binding. These results have important implications for understanding cell-specific reactions underlying the synthesis of selectin ligands in cancer cells and may provide a basis for the development of anti-metastatic gene therapy.</str>

      <str>Coding sequences of the paralogous FUT1 (H), FUT2 (Se), and Sec1 alpha 2-fucosyltransferase genes were obtained from different primate species. Analysis of the primate FUT1-like and FUT2-like sequences revealed the absence of the known human inactivating mutations giving rise to the h null alleles of FUT1 and the se null alleles of FUT2. Therefore, most primate FUT1-like and FUT2-like genes potentially code for functional enzymes. The Sec1-like gene encodes for a potentially functional alpha 2-fucosyltransferase enzyme in nonprimate mammals, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys, but it has been inactivated by a nonsense mutation at codon 325 in the ancestor of humans and African apes (gorillas, chimpanzees). Human and gorilla Sec1's have, in addition, two deletions and one insertion, respectively, 5' of the nonsense mutation leading to proteins shorter than chimpanzee Sec1. Phylogenetic analysis of the available H, Se, and Sec1 mammalian protein sequences demonstrates the existence of three clusters which correspond to the three genes. This suggests that the differentiation of the three genes is rather old and predates the great mammalian radiation. The phylogenetic analysis also suggests that Sec1 has a higher evolutionary rate than FUT2 and FUT1. Finally, we show that an Alu-Y element was inserted in intron 1 of the FUT1 ancestor of humans and apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons); this Alu-Y element has not been found in monkeys or nonprimate mammals, which lack ABH antigens on red cells. A potential mechanism leading to the red cell expression of the H enzyme in primates, related to the insertion of this Alu-Y sequence, is proposed.</str>

This O-fucose is further modified by Fringe, a GlcNAc transferase and other glycosyltransferases (O-fut1 in Drosophila and Pofut1 in mouse), to form an O-linked tetrasaccharide, which modulates Notch's selective binding to its ligands.</str>

      <str>The alpha-2-fucosyltransferases (alpha2FTs) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of alpha2fucosylated glycan structures. In mammalian genomes, there are three alpha2FT genes located in tandem-FUT1, FUT2, and Sec1-each contained within a single exon. It has been suggested that these genes originated from two successive duplications, with FUT1 being generated first and FUT2 and Sec1 second. Despite gene conversion being considered the main mechanism of concerted evolution in gene families, previous studies of primates alpha2FTs failed to detect it, although the occurrence of gene conversion between FUT2 and Sec1 was recently reported in a human allele. The primary aim of our work was to initiate a broader study on the molecular evolution of mammalian alpha2FTs. Sequence comparison leads us to confirm that the three genes appeared by two rounds of duplication. In addition, we were able to detect multiple gene-conversion events at the base of primates and within several nonprimate species involving FUT2 and Sec1. Gene conversion involving FUT1 and either FUT2 or Sec1 was also detected in rabbit. The extent of gene conversion between the alpha2FTs genes appears to be species-specific, possibly related to functional differentiation of these genes. With the exception of rabbits, gene conversion was not observed in the region coding the C-terminal part of the catalytic domain. In this region, the number of amino acids that are identical between FUT1 and FUT2, but different in Sec1, is higher than in other parts of the protein. The biologic meaning of this observation may be related to functional constraints.</str>

      <str>Two novel FUT1 alleles were defined by 9C&gt;T (silent) and 991C&gt;A (P331T) mutations, the latter located in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Five new alleles of FUT2 were found: three were characterized by new variants and two resulted from new combinations of known polymorphisms. The new 412G&gt;A (G138S) mutation also is located in the catalytic domain. A new nonsecretor allele, based on the presence of 428G&gt;A (nonsense), was found. Another FUT2 allele may have resulted from an intragenic crossover event. FUT3 analysis revealed seven novel alleles, partly based on the new mutations 41G&gt;A (R14H), 1060C&gt;G (R354G), 735G&gt;C (silent), and 882C&gt;T (silent). While 41G&gt;A is placed in the cytoplasmic domain and functional, 1060C&gt;G is placed in the catalytic domain.</str>
      <str>Multiple common and sporadic sequence variations including 14 new alleles at FUT1, FUT2, and FUT3 loci were identified. Four novel mutations result in amino acid substitution in the protein. Three of them are predicted to have adverse effects on the enzyme activity. A novel nonsecretor allele was found.</str>

      <str>The epithelial cell surface of the endometrium undergoes substantial biochemical changes to allow embryo attachment and implantation in early pregnancy. We hypothesized that tissue macrophages influence these events to promote uterine receptivity. To investigate the role of macrophages in regulating epithelial cell expression of genes linked to glycan-mediated embryo adhesion, Ishikawa, RL95-2 and HEC1A endometrial epithelial cells were cultured alone or with unactivated or lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytic U937 cells, separated using transwell inserts. Expression of mRNAs encoding two α1,2-fucosyltransferases (FUT1, FUT2) was increased in all three epithelial cell lines following co-culture with U937 cells, and was associated with increased fucosylation of cell surface glycoproteins detected using lectins from Ulex europaeus (UEA-1) and Dolichos biflorus (DBA). FUT1 induction by U937 cells also occurred in primary endometrial epithelial cells collected in luteal but not proliferative phase. Activation of the interleukin-6 (IL6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine signaling pathway with phosphorylation of STAT3 and elevated SOCS3 mRNA expression was evident in epithelial cells stimulated by U937 co-culture. Several recombinant macrophage-secreted cytokines exerted stimulatory or inhibitory effects on FUT1 and FUT2 mRNA expression, and the macrophage-derived cytokine LIF partially replicated the effects of U937 cells on both FUT1 and FUT2 expression and UEA-1 and DBA lectin reactivity in Ishikawa cells. These results suggest that macrophage-derived factors including LIF might facilitate development of an implantation-receptive endometrium by regulating surface glycan structures in epithelial cells. Abnormal phenotypes or altered abundance of uterine macrophages could contribute to the pathophysiology of primary unexplained infertility in women.</str>

      <str>The glycoantigen sialyl-Lewis x (sLex) and its isomer sialy-Lewis a (sLea) are frequently associated with advanced states of cancer and metastasis. In a previous work, we have shown that hepatocarcinoma cells (HCC) HepG2 interact with the endothelial E-selectin exclusively through sLe(x) oligosaccharides, the synthesis of which could be completely prevented by the alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase-I (FUT1), thus resulting in a strong inhibition of adhesion and rolling on activated endothelial cells. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of inhibiting sLex synthesis and the subsequent E-selectin adhesion, on HCC tumor growth in nude mice. Four weeks after subcutaneous transplantation of cells, no FUT1-derived tumor could be detected, whereas 75% of control animals developed large size tumor nodules. Between the 4th and the 8th week postinoculation, 33% tumors arose from FUT1-transduced cells but showed a slow growth (nodule volumes less than 500 mm(3)), while more than 50% of control tumors reached volumes between 1,500 and 3,000 mm(3). Several parameters were examined, including cell division and proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion to extracellular matrix components and angiogenesis/vasculogenesis. We provide evidence that among all, vasculogenesis was the most clearly affected by FUT1 expression, suggesting that tumor angiomorphogenesis may, at least partly, depend on E-selectin-mediated interaction between HCC and endothelial cells, the inhibition of which remarkably retards tumor growth.</str>

      <str>The expression of LeY, H2, H3, and H4 on a broad variety of human leukemia cell lines and native lymphocytes as well as on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was examined by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. CD34+ leukemia cell lines (KG1, KG1a, and TF1) and native CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells expressed H2 (CD173) and LeY (CD174). In contrast, CD34(-) cell lines (HL-60, U937, JOK-1, Raji, Molt-3, Jurkat, and CEM-C7) and mature lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tonsils lacked CD173 and CD174. All cell lines and native lymphocytes as well as CD34+ precursor cells were negative for H3 and H4. Immunoprecipitation and consecutive Western blotting revealed a 170-kDa glycoprotein as the carrier molecule for the CD173 and CD174 oligosaccharide sequences on CD34+ hematopoietic precursors. The key enzyme for generating CD173 is the beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (FUT1). As shown by RT-PCR, FUT1 was expressed in immature hematopoietic cells but absent in mature lymphocytes, which indicates that expression of CD173 within the hematopoietic system is regulated at the transcriptional level by FUT1. Due to their exclusive presence on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, CD173 and CD174 represent novel markers of early hematopoiesis. The expression of the fucosylated histo-blood group antigens CD173 and CD174 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and down-regulation of FUT1 in mature lymphocytes may be important factors influencing the homing process of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow.</str>

      <str>Escherichia coli F18 bacteria producing enterotoxins and/or shigatoxin (ETEC/STEC) are main pathogens that cause oedema disease and postweaning diarrhoea in piglets, and alpha-1-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been identified as a candidate gene for controlling the expression of ETEC F18 receptor. The genetic variations at nucleotide position 307 in open reading frame of FUT1 gene in one wild boar breed and 20 western commercial and Chinese native pig breeds were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The results showed that the genetic polymorphisms of the FUT1 locus were only detected in western pig breeds and the Chinese Taihu (including Meishan pig, Fengjing pig and Erhualian pig), Huai and Lingao pig breeds; only Duroc and Pietrain possessed the resistant AA genotype, while the wild boar and other Chinese pig breeds only presented the susceptible genotype GG. The results indicated that Chinese native pig breeds lack genetic factors providing resistance to ETEC F18 bacteria. The resistant allele to ETEC F18 might originate from European wild boar. It was inferred that oedema and postweaning diarrhoea caused by ETEC F18 have close relationship with the growth rate, which can explain why on the contrary Chinese native pig breeds have stronger resistance to oedema and postweaning diarrhoea in piglets compared with western pig breeds.</str>

      <str>Para-Bombay phenotype, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 8000 in Taiwanese residents based on serological analysis, is caused by aberrant alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase function and hence diminished H-antigen synthesis. In an individual with para-Bombay phenotype, DNA sequencing revealed two missense mutations previously reported C658T mutation and a novel G659A mutation. Haplotype analysis with restriction enzyme digestion showed that the two mutations are located on opposing alleles of the H (FUT1) gene and lead to compound heterozygosity. Since no other known genetic changes were evident, it appears that the new missense mutation, G659A, is deleterious to the alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase function encoded by the H (FUT1) gene.</str>

      <str>The intestinal epithelium contains columnar epithelial cells (ECs) and M cells, and fucosylation of the apical surface of ECs and M cells is involved in distinguishing the two populations and in their response to commensal flora and environmental stress. Here, we show that fucosylated ECs (F-ECs) were induced in the mouse small intestine by the pro-inflammatory agents dextran sodium sulfate and indomethacin, in addition to an enteropathogen derived cholera toxin. Although F-ECs showed specificity for the M cell-markers, lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 and our monoclonal antibody NKM 16-2-4, these cells also retained EC-phenotypes including an affinity for the EC-marker lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Interestingly, fucosylation of Peyer's patch M cells and F-ECs was distinctly regulated by α(1,2)fucosyltransferase Fut1 and Fut2, respectively. These results indicate that Fut2-mediated F-ECs share M cell-related fucosylated molecules but maintain distinctive EC characteristics, Fut1 is, therefore, a reliable marker for M cells.</str>

The full coding region of alpha (1, 2) fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1 and FUT2) in the probands was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the amplified fragments were directly sequenced, meanwhile the mutations of FUT1 were also identified by TOPO TA cloning sequence method. The results indicated that two heterozygous mutations were detected by directly sequencing in two probands: AG deletion at position 547 - 552 and C to T mutation at position 658. Two different mutations were confirmed to be true compound heterozygotes with each mutation on a separate homologous chromosome by TOPO TA cloning sequence method. AG deletion at position 547 - 552 caused a reading frame shift and a premature stop codon. C658T mutation resulted in Arg--&gt;Cys at amino acid position 220. It is suggested that the FUT1 mutation of two probands are compound heterozygous mutation with different chromosomes, which are named h1h3 and may be the genetics basis of para-Bombay phenotype.</str>

      <str>The reason why delayed RBC engraftment and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) develop only in some but not all recipients of major ABO-incompatible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains elusive and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Understanding how incompatible erythroid blood group antibodies (Abs) interact with ABH antigens (Ags) of grafts, and investigating how to induce artificially accommodation of grafts are of obvious importance in transplantation immunology. The effects of anti-H on proliferation, apoptosis, and α-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1) expression in erythroid differentiated K562 cells were analyzed by the MTT assay, Annexin V/PI staining, and quantitative RT-PCR method. The growth of erythroid differentiated K562 cells was significantly suppressed when anti-H dilution was ≤ 1:8 (P&lt;0.001, as compared with 1:16). Under the complement-free culture conditions, the apoptotic ratio of erythroid differentiated K562 cells was significantly increased when anti-H dilution was ≤ 1:16 (P&lt;0.05, as compared with 1:32). The apoptosis was not only closely associated with anti-H dilution (F=138.991, P&lt;0.001), but also correlated with treated time (F=583.249, P&lt;0.001), which indicated typical dose- and time-dependent effects. Under the complement-free culture conditions, the FUT1 mRNA expression level was also suppressed when anti-H dilution was ≤ 1:16 (P&lt;0.05, as compared with 1:32), which also manifested in typical dose-dependent (F=130.356, P&lt;0.001) and time-dependent (F=1432.00, P&lt;0.001) effects. The results confirm that anti-H can trigger apoptosis and down-regulate FUT1 expression in erythroid differentiated K562 cells without complement mediation. The findings suggest that anti-H could accommodate grafts through triggering apoptosis and down-regulating Fut1 expression to reduce ABH antigens.</str>

      <str>Glycolipids in epithelial tissues of the gastrointestinal tract act as receptors for enteric bacteria and are implicated in the activation of the intestinal immune system. To clarify the genes involved in the fucosylation of the major glycolipids, substrate glycolipids and fucosylated products were measured in tissues of wild-type and mutant mice lacking alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes FUT1 or FUT2. Quantitative determination was performed by TLC-immunostaining for GA1 (Gg4Cer), FGA1 (fucosyl GA1), GM1 (II3NeuAc-Gg4Cer), FGM1 (fucosyl GM1), and Forssman glycolipids. Both FGM1 and FGA1 completely disappeared from the antrum, cecum, and colon of FUT2-null mice, but not those of FUT1-null and wild-type mice. Precursor glycolipids, GM1 and GA1, accumulated in tissues of FUT2-null mice, indicating that the FUT2-encoded enzyme preferentially participates in the fucosylation of GA1 and GM1 in these tissues. Female reproductive organs were similarly found to utilize FUT2 for the fucosylation of glycolipids FGA1 (uterus and cervix), and FGM1 (ovary), due to their absence in FUT2-null mice. In FUT1-null mice FGA1 was lost from the pancreas, but was present in wild-type and FUT2-null mice, indicating that FUT1 is essential for fucosylation of GA1 in the pancreas. Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I lectin histochemistry for alpha(1,2)fucose residues confirmed the absence of alpha(1,2)fucose residues from the apical surface of pancreatic acinar glands of FUT1-null mice. Ileum, epididymis, and testis retained specific fucosylated glycolipids, irrespective of targeted deletion of either gene, indicating either compensation for or redundancy of the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes in these tissues.</str>

      <str>The Escherichia coli F18 receptor locus (ECF18R) has been genetically mapped to the halothane linkage group on porcine Chromosome (Chr) 6. In an attempt to obtain candidate genes for this locus, we isolated 5 cosmids containing the alpha (1,2)fucosyltransferase genes FUT1, FUT2, and the pseudogene FUT2P from a porcine genomic library. Mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization placed all these clones in band q11 of porcine Chr 6 (SSC6q11). Sequence analysis of the cosmids resulted in the characterization of an open reading frame (ORF), 1098 bp in length, that is 82.3% identical to the human FUT1 sequence; a second ORF, 1023 bp in length, 85% identical to the human FUT2 sequence; and a third FUT-like sequence thought to be a pseudogene. The FUT1 and FUT2 loci therefore seem to be the porcine equivalents of the human blood group H and Secretor loci. Direct sequencing of the two ORFs in swine being either susceptible or resistant to adhesion and colonization by F18 fimbriated Escherichia coli (ECF18) revealed two polymorphisms at bp 307 (M307) and bp 857 (M857) of the FUT1 ORF. Analysis of these mutations in 34 Swiss Landrace families with 221 progeny showed close linkage with the locus controlling resistance and susceptibility to E. coli F18 adhesion and colonization in the small intestine (ECF18R), and with the locus of the blood group inhibitor S. A high linkage disequilibrium of M307-ECF18R in Large White pigs makes the M307 mutation a good marker for marker-assisted selection of E. coli F18 adhesion-resistant animals in this breed. Whether the FUT1 or possibly the FUT2 gene products are involved in the synthesis of carbohydrate structures responsible for bacterial adhesion remains to be determined.</str>

The alpha-3-fucosyltransferases: FUT3 (Lewis) of exocrine secretions; FUT4 (myeloid) of white cells and brain; FUT5 whose tissue distribution has not been defined as yet; FUT6 (plasma) present in plasma, renal proximal tubules and hepatocytes; FUT7 (leukocyte) found in neutrophils. A high DNA sequence homology has been detected among the genes within each of these two groups, while no homology has been detected between the genes of the two groups. Point mutations responsible of inactivating genetic polymorphisms have been found for FUT1, FUT2, FUT3 and FUT6, while FUT4 and FUT7 seem to be genetically monomorphic.

The results showed that none of the individuals in all 21 breeds possessed the resistant AA genotype, the genetic polymorphisms of the FUT1 locus were only detected in two western pig breeds (Duroc and Yorkshire), Lingao pig and hybrid pig breeds, while the wild boar and all the other Chinese pig breeds only possessed the susceptible GG genotype. The results indicated that Chinese native pig breeds, unlike western pig breeds, lack the genetic background on the resistance to ETEC F18 bacteria. This may be owe to their different origination, as the resistance gene to ETEC F18 might be originated from European wild boar.

PCR product was ligated into expression vector using TOPO TA cloning kit to obtain the recombinant plasmids. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells by liposome method. After screening by using G418, H antigen expression on the COS-7 was tested by flow cytometry and fut1 mRNA was detected by real-time PCR. The results indicated that three kinds of recombinant plasmids pcDNA3.1/V5-His-wild (35C + 682A), pcDNA3.1/V5-His-35T and pcDNA3.1/V5-His-35T-682G were successfully constructed. After transfection, the H antigen expressed on membrane of COS-7 cells at the second day, with the maximum level of expression at the fourth day. When compared with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-wild transfected cells, the H antigen expression level of the 35T and 682G + 35T recombinant plasmids in the transfected cells was 52.7% and 13.3% on the fourth day, respectively. Although the level of fut1 mRNA decreased with prolonging of time, the mRNA expressed on the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-35T-682G transfected cells reached to 14% of the wild plasmids on the first day.

      <str>To investigate the synthesis of alpha2-fucosylated epitopes in the bovine species, we have characterized cDNAs from various tissues. We found three distinct alpha2-fucosyltransferase genes, named bovine fut1, fut2, and sec1 which are homologous to human FUT1, FUT2, and Sec1 genes, respectively. Their open reading frames (ORF) encode polypeptides of 360 (bovine H), 344 (bovine Se), and 368 (bovine Sec1) amino acids, respectively. These enzymes transfer fucose in alpha1,2 linkage to ganglioside GM(1)and galacto- N -biose, but not to the phenyl-beta-D-galactoside, type 1 or type 2 acceptors, suggesting that their substrate specificity is different and more restricted than the other cloned mammalian alpha2-fucosyltransferases. Southern blot analyses detected four related alpha2-fucosyltransferase sequences in the bovine genome while only three have been described in other species. The supernumerary entity seems to be related to the alpha2-fucosyltransferase activity which can also use type 1 and phenyl-beta-D-galactoside substrate acceptors. It was exclusively found in bovine intestinal tract. Our results show that, at least in one mammalian species, four alpha2-fucosyltransferases are present, three adding a fucose on alpha1,2 linkage on type 3/4 acceptor (Galbeta1-3GalNAc) and another able to transfer also fucose on phenyl-beta-D-galactoside and type 1 (Galbeta1-3GlcNAc) acceptors. The phylogenetic tree of the enzymes homologous to those encoded by the bovine fut1, fut2, and sec1 genes revealed two main families, one containing all the H-like proteins and the second containing all the Se-like and Sec1-like proteins. The Sec1-like family had a higher evolutionary rate than the Se-like family.</str>

      <str>The α-(1,2) fucosyltransferases (Fut1 and Fut2) and α-(1,3) fucosyltransferases (Fut4, Fut9) are responsible for the synthesis of Lewis X (LeX) and Lewis Y (LeY) conjugated to glycoproteins. We recently reported that these fucosyltransferases were differentially expressed in the reproductive tract of male mouse. Here, we studied the effect of androgen on fucosyltransferase expression through the use of mouse castration models. We found that Fut1 mRNA and Fut4 mRNA were upregulated, while Fut2 mRNA and Fut9 mRNA were downregulated by androgen in the caput epididymis. However, in the vas deferens and prostate, only Fut4 mRNA and Fut2 mRNA were respectively upregulated following exposure to androgen. In the seminal vesicle, all fucosyltransferases, with the exception of Fut9, were upregulated. We identified the androgen receptor binding sites (ARBSs) of Fut2, Fut4 and Fut9 in the caput epididymis. Luciferase assay for these ARBSs is able to provide an indication as to why Fut4 and Fut9 are differently expressed and regulated by androgen, although they catalyze the same α-(1,3) fucose linkage. Our study showed that androgen could differentially regulate the expression of these fucosyltransferases and provided an insight into the characteristic distribution of each fucosyltransferase responsible for LeX/LeY biosynthesis in the male reproductive tract. </str>

      <str>The complete coding sequences of three rat alpha1,2fucosyltransferase genes were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed that these genes, called FTA, FTB and FTC, were homologous to human FUT1, FUT2 and Sec1, respectively. A distance analysis between all alpha1,2fucosyltransferase sequences available showed that the two domains of the catalytic region evolved differently with little divergence between the FUT2 and Sec1 N-terminal domains, quite distant from that of FUT1. At variance, FUT1 and FUT2 C-terminal domains were less distant while a high evolutionary rate was noted for Sec1 C-terminal domain. Whereas FTA and FTB encode typical glycosyltransferases, FTC lacks the homologous start codon and encodes a protein devoid of intracellular and transmembrane domains. It is located on rat chromosome 1q34. Transfection experiments revealed that unlike FTA and FTB, FTC does not generate enzyme activity. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that H type 2 epitopes were synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected by both FTA and FTB cDNA, but only FTB transfectants possessed H type 3 determinants. In REG rat carcinoma cells, both FTA and FTB allowed synthesis of H type 2 and H type 3 at the cell surface. Western blots showed that, in both cell types, FTA was able to synthesize H type 2 epitopes on a larger set of glycoproteins than FTB. Analysis of the kinetic parameters obtained using small oligosaccharides revealed only a slight preference of FTA for type 2 over other types of acceptor substrates, whereas FTB was barely able to fucosylate this substrate.</str>

      <str>This is a study on the allele composing of ABO, FUT1 and FUT2 gene loci of 10 para-Bombay individuals in China.</str>
      <str>Ten samples coming from different districts of China were suspected of para-Bombay phenotype by primary serology tests. Routine and absorb-elution tests were conducted to identify their ABO type, and duplex polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was applied to getting their ABO genotype. Most of them were submitted to a test of their Lewis type as well. Then through direct DNA sequencing with PCR products of FUT1 and FUT2 genes, the genotypes of their H and SE gene loci were analyzed.</str>
      <str>It can be confirmed that the 10 samples are para-Bombay. All of their ABO genotypes are consistent with the serological absorb-elution results and the substances detected results in saliva. Seven out of 10 have recessive homozygous gene at their H locus. Each phenotype of h1h1 (nt547-552Deltaag), h2h2 (nt880-882Deltatt) and h4h4 (nt35 t--&gt;c) are ascertained in 2 individuals; moreover, h3h3 (nt 658 c--&gt;t) is identified in one individual. The rest are hh heterozygous individuals: one is h3/h(new-1); the other is h2/h(new-2); the last one is h1/h2. The h(new-1) (nt586 c--&gt;t) allele has a point mutation at nt 586 C to T, which leads a nonsense mutation Gln(CAG) to stop (TAG).The second h (new-2) (nt328 g--&gt;a) has an nt328 G to A missense mutation,which leads Ala (GCC),was replaced by Thr (ACC) at 110 amino acid position. All the 10 samples have Se (nt357 c--&gt;t) synonymous mutation. One Bm(h) (B/O) individual with h4h4 phenotype has a Se(w)(nt357 c--&gt;t; nt385 a--&gt;t) allele, whose Lewis type is Le(a+b+). Moreover, the authors detected a (nt716 g--&gt;a) mutation in two samples' Se gene.</str>
      <str>Four kinds of known h alleles (h1-h4), 2 kinds of novel non-functional FUT1 alleles, a Se(w) allele, and a novel SeG716A polymorphism in Chinese para-Bombay individuals were detected. At the same time, the authors noticed that all the 10 samples have the nt357 c--&gt;t mutation in their FUT2 gene.</str>

      <str>Escherichia coli F18 is a common porcine enteric pathogen causing diarrhea and edema in weaned pigs. An essential step in the pathogenesis of this enteric colibacillosis is a fimbria-receptor interaction in the small intestine, involving the α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1) enzyme for bacterial receptor binding to the epithelium. Enzyme expression is genetically determined and increases after weaning at 3 to5 wk, probably due to age- and/or diet-related intestinal maturation. We hypothesized that artificially reared piglets, deprived of sow's milk from birth, show susceptibility to F18 already in the neonatal period. First we verified the intestinal expression of FUT1 in preterm, term, and weaned pigs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Then age-related F18 susceptibility (degree of diarrhea) was evaluated in 3-, 10-, and 20-d-old pigs after inoculation of 10(10) cfu E. coli F18 per day for 12 d. Finally, F18 susceptibility was evaluated in caesarean-delivered 0- to 7-d-old piglets inoculated daily with F18 as above. For all pigs, their sows were genotyped to ensure expression of the FUT1 enzyme. FUT1 expression was detected in the proximal and distal small intestine with no apparent differences in levels among preterm, term, and weaned pigs. No consistent F18-induced diarrhea was detected in any of the 3 groups of 3- to 20-d-old pigs. In contrast, 0- to 7-d-old caesarean-delivered pigs showed a higher score of diarrhea in pigs inoculated with F18 compared with controls (2.4 ± 0.1 vs. 1.8 ± 0.1 respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Caesarean-delivered piglets deprived of sow milk are highly susceptible to diarrhea induced by E. coli F18. Lack of the protective effects of birth colonization and sow milk may contribute to high intestinal F18 sensitivity. The newborn pig may be a useful model to investigate factors in maternal milk that protect against F18 diarrhea.</str>

      <str>To specifically eliminate recipient anti-blood group ABO antibodies prior to ABO-incompatible organ or bone marrow transplantation, an efficient absorber of ABO antibodies has been developed in which blood group determinants may be carried at high density and by different core saccharide chains on a mucin-type protein backbone. The absorber was made by transfecting different host cells with cDNAs encoding a P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/mouse immunoglobulin G(2b) chimera (PSGL-1/mIgG(2b)), the H- or Se-gene encoded alpha1,2-fucosyltransferases (FUT1 or FUT2) and the blood group A gene encoded alpha1,3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (alpha1,3 GalNAcT). Western blot analysis of affinity-purified recombinant PSGL-1/mIgG(2b) revealed that different precursor chains were produced in 293T, COS-7m6, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 host cells coexpressing FUT1 or FUT2. FUT1 directed expression of H type 2 structures mainly, whereas FUT2 preferentially made H type 3 structures. None of the host cells expressing either FUT1 or FUT2 supported expression of H type 1 structures. Furthermore, the highest A epitope density was on PSGL-1/mIgG2(2b) made in CHO-K1 cells coexpressing FUT2 and the alpha1,3 GalNAcT. This PSGL-1/mIgG(2b) was used for absorption of anti-blood group A antibodies in human blood group O serum. At least 80 times less A trisaccharides on PSGL-1/mIgG(2b) in comparison to A trisaccharides covalently linked to macroporous glass beads were needed for the same level of antibody absorption. In conclusion, PSGL-1/mIgG(2b), if substituted with A epitopes, was shown to be an efficient absorber of anti-blood group A antibodies and a suitable model protein for studies on protein glycosylation.</str>

      <str>Oedema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea in swine are associated with the colonization of the intestine with toxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli bacteria of various serotypes. Colonization depends on specific binding between adhesive fimbriae and receptors on the enterocytes. The demonstration of these receptors allows the identification of susceptible and resistant pigs. Direct sequencing of the alpha (1,2) fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1) in swine being either susceptible or resistant to adhesion by F18 fimbriated E.coli revealed a mutation at basepair 307 (M307). Analysis of the mutation in Swiss Landrace and Large White families showed close linkage with the locus controlling resistance and susceptibility to E.coli F18 adhesion (ECF18R). The FUT1 (M307) mutation is a good marker for selection of E.coli of F18 adhesion resistant animals. The mutation is found with variable frequencies in Duroc, Hampshire and Pietrain pigs as well.</str>

      <str>In many infection studies and approaches in breeding research it is of high importance to know the genetic predisposition of pigs for the susceptibility to the Escherichia coli (E. coli). Therefore, we developed a gene test to determine the status of the F18 receptor, as indicated by the FUT1 gene. A SNP in the FUT1 gene was first described by Vogeli et al. (1996) and a gene test was patented by Meijerink et al. (1997). Up until now, the gene test of Meijerink has been used in research. However, faster and cheaper genotyping techniques are now available, which led us to develop an easily applicable, fast and cost effective genetic test to determine the status of the F18 receptor. To check the accuracy of the new test, we genotyped 32 pigs with the established test as well as with our new test. All in all, we genotyped 430 German Landrace pigs. The test was successful. We suggest this allele specific test as a new standard genetic tool to determine the ETEC F18 receptor status in pigs.</str>

      <str>Synthesis of A, B, H, Lewis and related histo-blood group antigens is catalyzed by different fucosyltransferases. Enzymatic acceptor specificity and tissue expression permit the definition of 2 types of alpha-2-fucosyltransferases and 5 types of alpha-3-fucosyltransferases encoded by specific genes registered as FUT1 to FUT7. We have previously assigned FUT4 to 11q21, the cluster FUT1-FUT2 to 19q13.3 and the cluster FUT6-FUT3-FUT5 to 19p13.3. The last gene cloned (FUT7) encodes an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase expressed in leukocytes which synthesizes the sialyl Lĕ antigen, a selectin ligand. We have localized this gene by PCR assay using somatic cell hybrids, which retain rearrangements of chromosome 9 characterized in respect with the genetic microsatellite map, and then by screening a cosmid library.

      <str>We examined the expression in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) of Globo H, a potential tumor-associated antigen for immunotherapy of epithelial cancers including breast cancer. Flow cytometry revealed Globo H expression in 25/41 breast cancer specimens (61.0%). Non-BCSCs from 25/25 and BCSCs from 8/40 (20%) expressed Globo H. We showed the expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA3), the pentasaccharide precursor of Globo H, in 31/40 (77.5%) tumors. Non-BCSCs from 29/40 [corrected] and BCSCs from 25/40 (62.5%) expressed SSEA3. Like Globo H, SSEA3 expression in normal tissues was predominately at the secretory borders of epithelium, where access to the immune system is restricted. Immunization of mice with Globo H-KLH and alpha-GalCer induced antibodies reactive with Globo H and SSEA3, suggesting that a Globo H-based vaccine will target tumor cells expressing Globo H or SSEA3. We next sought to reduce Globo H expression by siRNA targeting fucosyltransferase (FUT) 1 and 2, which mediate alpha-1,2 linkage of fucose to SSEA3 to generate Globo H. We showed both genes to be involved in the biosynthesis of Globo H. Moreover, FUT2 expression in BCSCs was significantly lower than in non-BCSCs harvested from a primary human breast cancer in NOD/SCID mouse, whereas FUT1 was slightly lower in BCSCs. Thus, the lower expression of Globo H in BCSCs may be attributed to less FUT2/FUT1, and to reduced SSEA3 in BCSCs compared with non-BCSCs. Our findings provide insight into further development of a Globo H-based vaccine and FUT1/FUT2-targeted therapy for breast cancer.</str>

      <str>Inflammation of stomach mucosa has been postulated as initiator of gastric carcinogenesis and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines can regulate specific genes involved in this process. The cellular expression pattern of glycosyltransferases and Lewis antigens detected in the normal mucosa changed during the neoplassic transformation. The aim of this work was to determine the regulation of specific fucosyltransferases and sialyltransferases by IL-1β and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines in MKN45 gastric cancer cells. IL-1β induced significant increases in the mRNA levels of FUT1, FUT2 and FUT4, and decreases of FUT3 and FUT5. In IL-6 treatments, enhanced FUT1 and lower FUT3 and FUT5 mRNA expression were detected. No substantial changes were observed in the levels of ST3GalIII and ST3GalIV. The activation of FUT1, FUT2 and FUT4 by IL-1β is through the NF-κB pathway and the down-regulation of FUT3 and FUT5 by IL-6 is through the gp130/STAT-3 pathway, since they are inhibited specifically by panepoxydone and AG490, respectively. The levels of Lewis antigens after IL-1β or IL-6 stimulation decreased for sialyl-Lewis x, and no significant differences were found in the rest of the Lewis antigens analyzed, as it was also observed in subcutaneous mice tumors from MKN45 cells treated with IL-1β or IL-6. In addition, in 61 human intestinal-type gastric tumors, sialyl-Lewis x was highly detected in samples from patients that developed metastasis. These results indicate that the expression of the fucosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of Lewis antigens in gastric cancer cells can be specifically modulated by IL-1β and IL-6 inflammatory cytokines.</str>

Molecular analyses of the FUT2 polymorphism of various populations have indicated the ethnic specificity of null alleles: the null allele se(428) is a common Se enzyme-deficient allele in Africans and Caucasians but does not occur in Asians, whereas the null allele se(357,385) is specific to Asians.

      <str>Fucose-alpha(1-2)-galactose [Fucalpha(1-2)Gal] sugars have been implicated in the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal development, learning, and memory. However, an understanding of their precise roles has been hampered by a lack of information regarding Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins. Here, we report the first proteomic studies of this plasticity-relevant epitope. We identify five classes of putative Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins: cell adhesion molecules, ion channels and solute carriers/transporters, ATP-binding proteins, synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, and mitochondrial proteins. In addition, we show that Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins are enriched in the developing mouse olfactory bulb (OB) and exhibit a distinct spatiotemporal expression that is consistent with the presence of a "glycocode" to help direct olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal pathfinding. We find that expression of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal sugars in the OB is regulated by the alpha(1-2)fucosyltransferase FUT1. FUT1-deficient mice exhibit developmental defects, including fewer and smaller glomeruli and a thinner olfactory nerve layer, suggesting that fucosylation contributes to OB development. Our findings significantly expand the number of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which fucosyl sugars contribute to neuronal processes.</str>

      <str>Cell surface carbohydrate structures including sialyl-Lewis X (sLe(x)) and Lewis Y (Le(y)) are important ligands in normal and malignant tissues. The aim here was to determine the possible influence on the expression of such antigens by two viruses varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) involved in persistent infections of humans. We found that infection of human diploid fibroblasts with both viruses resulted in transcriptional activation of several fucosyltransferase (FUT) genes that were either dormant or expressed at low levels in uninfected cells. Both viruses induced FUT3, FUT5, and FUT6, encoding alpha1,3- and/or alpha1,4-specific fucosyltransferases. CMV, but not VZV, induced transcription of FUT1 (encoding an alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferase), FUT7, and FUT9. The changes in transcription of FUT genes were expectedly associated with expression of Le(y) in CMV-infected cells and sLe(x) in the VZV-infected fibroblasts although no expression of these antigens was observed in uninfected cells. One major explanation for this difference between CMV- and VZV-infected cells was that CMV, but not VZV, induced expression of FUT1, necessary for Le(y) expression. The induced carbohydrate antigens in CMV- and VZV-infected cells could be of significance for virus spread and possible escape from immune responses.</str>

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 2 is associated with lack of the membrane glycoprotein sialyl-Lewisx (CD15s). In the red blood cells (RBCs), lack of the membrane glycoprotein H is manifested as a Bombay (Oh) blood type. Two consecutive pregnancies it risk for RHS were monitored during mid-trimester by cordocentesis. One fetus expressed H substance and her blood phenotype was O Rh+. The second fetus, a female, was 2 weeks smaller than expected by dates and had the Bombay blood type. The placenta of the affected fetus was small and irregular. This is the first prenatal diagnosis of this syndrome and the first case found in a female. The documentation of the syndrome in patients of both sexes and the parental consanguinity support an autosomal recessive inheritance. Two apparent recombinations between fucosyl-transferase 1 (FUT1, the H gene) and fucosyl-transferase 2 (secretor) are suggestive of non-allelic heterogeneity. We believe that the Bombay phenotype in this family is caused by a mutated gene, other than FUT1, which is causing multiple deficiencies of fucosilated proteoglycans.</str>

      <str>RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus) is a highly virulent calicivirus that has become a major cause of mortality in wild rabbit populations (Oryctolagus cuniculus). It binds to the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) H type 2 which requires an alpha1,2fucosyltransferase for its synthesis. In rabbit, three alpha1,2fucosyltransferases genes are known, Fut1, Fut2, and Sec1. Nonfunctional alleles at any of these loci could potentially confer resistance to RHDV, similar to human FUT2 alleles that determine the nonsecretor phenotype and resistance to infection by various NoV strains. In this study, we looked for the presence of H type 2 on buccal epithelial cells of wild rabbits from two geographic areas under RHDV pressure and from one RHDV-free area. Some animals with diminished H type 2 expression were found in the three populations (nonsecretor-like phenotype). Their frequency markedly increased according to the RHDV impact, suggesting that outbreaks selected survivors with low expression of the virus ligand. Polymorphisms of the Fut1, Fut2, and Sec1 coding regions were determined among animals that either died or survived outbreaks. The Fut2 and Sec1 genes presented a high polymorphism and the frequency of one Sec1 allele was significantly elevated, over 6-fold, among survivors. Sec1 enzyme variants showed either moderate, low, or undetectable catalytic activity, whereas all variant Fut2 enzymes showed strong catalytic activity. This functional analysis of the enzymes encoded by each Fut2 and Sec1 allele suggests that the association between one Sec1 allele and survival might be explained by a deficit of alpha1,2fucosyltransferase expression rather than by impaired catalytic activity.</str>

      <str>Notch (N) and its ligands, Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser), are transmembrane proteins that mediate the cell-cell interactions necessary for many cell-fate decisions. In Drosophila, N is predominantly localized to the apical portion of epithelial cells, but the mechanisms and functions of this localization are unknown. Here, we found N, Dl, and Ser were mostly located in the region from the subapical complex (SAC) to the apical portion of the adherens junctions (AJs) in wing disc epithelium. N was delivered to the SAC/AJs in two phases. First, polarized exocytosis specifically delivered nascent N to the apical plasma membrane and AJs in an O-fut1-independent manner. Second, N at the plasma membrane was relocated to the SAC/AJs by Dynamin- and Rab5-dependent transcytosis; this step required the O-fut1 function. Disruption of the apical polarity by Drosophila E-cadherin (DEcad) knock down caused N and Dl localization to the SAC/AJs to fail. N, but not Dl, formed a specific complex with DEcad in vivo. Finally, our results suggest that juxtacrine signaling in epithelia generally depends on the apicobasally polarized structure of epithelial cells.</str>

      <str>Immature dendritic cells (DCs) are recruited from blood into tissues to patrol for foreign antigens. After antigen uptake and processing, DCs mature and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs where they initiate immune responses. DC-SIGN is a DC-specific C-type lectin that acts both as a pattern recognition receptor and as an adhesion molecule. As an adhesion molecule, DC-SIGN is able to mediate rolling and adhesion over endothelial cells under shear flow. In this study, we show that the binding partner of DC-SIGN on endothelial cells is the glycan epitope Lewis(Y) (Le(Y)), expressed on ICAM-2. The interaction between DC-SIGN on dendritic cells and ICAM-2 on endothelial cells is strictly glycan-specific. ICAM-2 expressed on CHO cells only served as a ligand for DC-SIGN when properly glycosylated, underscoring its function as a scaffolding protein. The expression of Le(Y) in endothelial cells is directed by the enzyme FUT1. Silencing of FUT1 results in a decrease in the rolling and adhesion of immature DCs over endothelial cells. The identification of Le(Y) as the carbohydrate ligand of DC-SIGN in endothelial cells opens new possibilities for the manipulation of DC migration.</str>

      <str>Fucosyltransferases are involved in the last steps of the biosynthesis of ABH and Lewis oligosaccharide antigens. Seven human genes (FUT1 to FUT7) and one pseudogene (Sec 1) have been cloned and localized on different chromosomes (9q34.3; 11q21; 19p13.3 and 19q13.3). Their locations and their high degree of primary sequence identity, suggest that they have appeared by successive duplications followed by translocation and divergent evolution. Their expression is tissue specific and they present a switch during human embryo-foetal development similar to that of hemoglobins. Polymorphic genes FUT1-FUT2 and FUT3-FUT5-FUT6 are organized in two clusters and each gene is partially or totally inactivated by different types of point mutations (nonsense, missense and frame shift), complete gene deletion or a fusion gene. The products of the monomorphic genes FUT4 and FUT7 seem implicated in cell-cell interactions during embryo-foetal development and in the leukocyte adhesion phenomena to endothelial cells in the adult. A phylogenetic tree of the 28 available nucleotide coding sequences of fucosyltransferases has allowed us to situate the duplication events with respect to the separation of species from the main evolutionary path (nematods, birds, mammals, primates and humans). Recently, using a computer approach a general structure of fucosyltransferases has been proposed, inspired from the crystalline structure of the beta-glucosyltransferase of bacteriophage T4. This folding contains two domains with an alternate succession alpha and beta chains. In this model the GDP-fucose binding site would be located between the two domains.</str>

      <str>Transfection of the mouse Fut1 and Fut2, and human FUT1 genes into human ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-1 cells resulted in 20-30-fold increases in cellular alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity, and in alteration of the glycolipid composition, including not only fucosylated products, but also precursor glycolipids. Although globo-series glycolipids were not significantly affected by the transfection, the major glycolipids belonging to the lacto-series type 1 chain family in RMG-1 cells and the transfectants were the Lc4Cer, Lewis a (Le)a and Leb, and H-1 glycolipids, respectively, suggesting that fucosylation of Lc4Cer to the H-1 glycolipid prevents the further modification of Lc4Cer to Lea and Leb in the transfectants. Also, the lacto-series type 2 chains in RMG-1 cells were LeX, NeuAc-nLc4Cer and NeuAc-LeX, and those in the transfectants were LeX and LeY, indicating that the sialylation of nLc4Cer and LeX is restricted by increased fucosylation of LeX. As a result, the amount of sialic acid released by sialidase from the transfectants decreased to 70% of that from RMG-1 cells, and several membrane-mediated phenomena, such as the cell-to-cell interaction between cancer cells and mesothelial cells, and the cell viability in the presence of an anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil, for the transfectants was found to be increased in comparison to that for RMG-1 cells. These findings indicate that cell surface carbohydrates are involved in the biological properties, including cell-to-cell adhesion and drug resistance, of cancer cells.</str>

      <str>Incompatible blood group antigens are highly immunogenic and can cause graft rejections. Focusing on distinct carbohydrate- and protein-based membrane structures, defined by blood group antigens, we investigated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured in human serum. The presence of H (CD173), ABO, RhD, RhCE, RhAG, Kell, urea transporter type B (SLC14A1, previously known as JK), and Duffy antigen receptor of chemokines (DARC) was evaluated at the levels of genome, transcriptome and antigen. Fucosyltransferase-1 (FUT1), RHCE, KEL, SLC14A1 (JK) and DARC mRNA were transcribed in MSCs. FUT1 mRNA transcription was lost during differentiation. The mRNA transcription of SLC14A1 (JK) decreased during chondrogenic differentiation, while that of DARC increased during adipogenic differentiation. All MSCs synthesized SLC14A1 (JK) but no DARC protein. However, none of the protein antigens tested occurred on the surface, indicating a lack of associated protein function in the membrane. As A and B antigens are neither expressed nor adsorbed, concerns of ABO compatibility with human serum supplements during culture are alleviated. The H antigen expression by GD2dim+ MSCs identified two distinct MSC subpopulations and enabled their isolation. We hypothesize that GD2(dim+) H(+) MSCs retain a better 'stemness'. Because immunogenic blood group antigens are lacking, they cannot affect MSC engraftment in vivo, which is promising for clinical applications.</str>

      <str>F18(+)Escherichia coli infections causing post-weaning diarrhoea and/or oedema disease are a major cause of economic losses in pig industry. To date, no preventive strategy can protect pigs from F18(+)E. coli infections. One of the most attractive approaches to eliminate F18(+)E. coli infections is the selection for pigs that are resistant to F18(+)E. coli infections. However, this strategy was not believed to be favourable because of reports of genetic association with the stress-susceptibility gene in the Swiss Landrace. To investigate this potential association more thoroughly, 131 randomly selected Belgian hybrid pigs were genotyped for both the F18(+)E. coli resistance alleles (FUT1(A)) and the stress-susceptibility alleles (RYR1(T)) and their association was investigated by determining the linkage disequilibrium. This linkage disequilibrium (LD=-0.0149) is close to zero and does not differ significantly from 0 (likelihood ratio test chi(1)(2)=1.123, P=0.29), demonstrating no association between the FUT1(A) and RYR1(T) alleles. Furthermore, only a small fraction (4.6%) of the Belgian pigs was found to be resistant to F18(+)E. coli infections. Our results suggest that selection for F18(+)E. coli resistant pigs might be an attractive approach to prevent pigs from F18(+)E. coli infections, unlike to what has previously been postulated.</str>

      <str>The circadian clock regulates various behavioral and physiological rhythms in mammals. Circadian changes in olfactory functions such as neuronal firing in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory sensitivity have recently been identified, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We analyzed the temporal profiles of glycan structures in the mouse OB using a high-density microarray that includes 96 lectins, because glycoconjugates play important roles in the nervous system such as neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Sixteen lectin signals significantly fluctuated in the OB, and the intensity of all three that had high affinity for α1-2-fucose (α1-2Fuc) glycan in the microarray was higher during the nighttime. Histochemical analysis revealed that α1-2Fuc glycan is located in a diurnal manner in the lateral olfactory tract that comprises axon bundles of secondary olfactory neurons. The amount of α1-2Fuc glycan associated with the major target glycoprotein neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) varied in a diurnal fashion, although the mRNA and protein expression of Ncam1 did not. The mRNA and protein expression of Fut1, a α1-2-specific fucosyltransferase gene, was diurnal in the OB. Daily fluctuation of the α1-2Fuc glycan was obviously damped in homozygous Clock mutant mice with disrupted diurnal Fut1 expression, suggesting that the molecular clock governs rhythmic α1-2-fucosylation in secondary olfactory neurons. These findings suggest the possibility that the molecular clock is involved in the diurnal regulation of olfaction via α1-2-fucosylation in the olfactory system. </str>

      <str>Although Lewis X (LeX) and Lewis Y (LeY) antigens were thought to play important roles in fertility, fucosyltransferase (Fut)-deficient (Fut1, Fut2 and Fut4) mice which lack LeX or LeY antigen are still fertile. In the present study, the Fut-deficient and wild-type mice were used to measure the expression of Fut mRNA along the mouse male reproductive tract and determine the role of each Fut in the biosynthesis of LeX/LeY antigens, which are conjugated to glycoproteins in the male reproductive system. LeX/LeY-containing glycoproteins were detected in the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and coagulating gland, but not in the testis. We demonstrate that the synthesis of LeY-containing glycoproteins in the epididymis and vas deferens is catalyzed by Fut1 and Fut4. In the seminal vesicle and the coagulating gland, they are mainly synthesized by Fut2 and an α-(1,3)-Fut, but not Fut4. The synthesis of LeX-containing glycoproteins in the middle caput epididymis is catalyzed by Fut4 and by Fut4 and Fut2 in the seminal vesicle. We provide evidence that LeX is synthesized in the coagulating gland by Fut9. We found that the lack of activity by one Fut does not completely inhibit LeX/LeY antigen expression in the male reproductive tract. This redundancy may help to explain why in vivo studies with Fut-deficient mice do not support the presumption that LeX/LeY antigens play important roles in male fertility. We provide details regarding the phenotypes of established Fut-deficient mice and lay the foundation for elucidating the functions of LeX/LeY antigens in other aspects of the male reproductive system.</str>

      <str>To investigate the molecular genetics basis for one para-Bombay phenotype, the red blood cell phenotype of the proband was characterized by standard serological techniques. Exon 6 and 7 of ABO gene, the entire coding region of FUT1 gene and FUT2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of the proband respectively. The PCR products were purified by agarose gels and directly sequenced. The PCR-SSP and genescan were performed to confirm the mutations detected by sequencing. The results showed that the proband ABO genotype was A(102)A(102). Two heterozygous mutations of FUT1 gene, an A to G transition at position 682 and AG deletion at position 547-552 were detected in the proband. A682G could cause transition of Met--&gt;Val at amino acid position 228, AG deletion at position 547-552 caused a reading frame shift and a premature stop codon. The FUT2 genotype was heterozygous for a functional allele Se(357) and a weakly functional allele Se(357), 385 (T/T homozygous at position 357 and A/T heterozygous at 385 position). It is concluded that the compound heterozygous mutation--a novel A682G missense mutation and a 547-552 del AG is the molecular mechanism of this para-Bombay phenotype.</str>

      <str>In this paper we describe a new structure present in highly proliferative cells and absent in cells with normal growth potential. We used cultured bovine venular endothelial cells (CVEC) as examples of high proliferation, and dermal fibroblasts of a primary culture as examples of normal proliferation. The structure, consisting of tubules radiating from the nuclear region to the tips of cell protrusions, was revealed by its strong positivity to the fucose-binding lectin from Lotus (LTL) that prefers glycans with alpha-1,2-linked fucose. Another fucose-binding lectin that prefers glycans with alpha-1,6-linked fucose was instead found to localize glycans exclusively in Golgi complexes. LTL binding sites were also found at the surface of CVEC in a restricted region close to the nucleus. The role of alpha-1,2-linked fucose in forming or maintaining the tubules was confirmed by the fact that down-regulation of the fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 resulted in disappearance of the tubular structure. LTL also proved able to penetrate the cells through the tubular structures up to the nuclear region and to inhibit proliferation. Endostatin was also found to massively penetrate the cells in the tubular structures in control cells but not in FUT1/2 depleted cells. In cells of a first passage primary culture of dermal fibroblasts the tubular LTL-positive structure was absent as well as the LTL-positive sites at the external surface, and both fucose-binding lectins were found to exclusively localize glycans in Golgi complexes. Tubules were again found progressively in fibroblasts derived from repeated passages, where faster growing cells predominate. Disappearance of LTL-positivity in Golgi complexes paralleled appearance of LTL-positive tubules. The role of Golgi complexes in forming the tubules is discussed. </str>

      <str>Bombay phenotype is one of the rare phenotypes in the ABO blood group system that fails to express ABH antigens on red blood cells. Nonsense or missense mutations in fucosyltransfrase1 (FUT1) and fucosyltransfrase2 (FUT2) genes are known to create this phenotype. This blood group is compatible with all other blood groups as a donor, as it does not express the H antigen on the red blood cells. In this study, we describe the establishment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the dermal fibroblasts of a Bombay blood-type individual by the ectopic expression of established transcription factors Klf4, Oct4, Sox2, and c-Myc. Sequence analyses of fibroblasts and iPSCs revealed a nonsense mutation 826C to T (276 Gln to Ter) in the FUT1 gene and a missense mutation 739G to A (247 Gly to Ser) in the FUT2 gene in the Bombay phenotype under study. The established iPSCs resemble human embryonic stem cells in morphology, passaging, surface and pluripotency markers, normal karyotype, gene expression, DNA methylation of critical pluripotency genes, and in-vitro differentiation. The directed differentiation of the iPSCs into hematopoietic lineage cells displayed increased expression of the hematopoietic lineage markers such as CD34, CD133, RUNX1, KDR, alpha-globulin, and gamma-globulin. Such specific stem cells provide an unprecedented opportunity to produce a universal blood group donor, in-vitro, thus enabling cellular replacement therapies, once the safety issue is resolved.</str>

To begin to define the regulation and function of terminal alpha(1,2)fucosylated carbohydrates in these and other tissues, we isolated and characterized a 85-kilobase (kb) genomic region of mouse chromosome 7, 23.2 centimorgans analogous to human chromosome 19q13.3 that encodes three alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferases. Gene-specific DNA probes from the open reading frames of the mouse fucosyltransferase genes corresponding to human FUT1, FUT2, and SEC1 demonstrate distinct tissue-specific expression patterns by Northern blot analyses. Flow cytometry profiles of cultured cells transfected with DNA segments containing the open reading frames of the mouse genes confirm that each encodes an alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase. In uterus and colon, a 3.3-kb FUT2 mRNA represents the major fucosyltransferase gene expressed. Steady-state FUT2 mRNA levels are cyclically regulated during the estrus cycle, increasing 10-fold from early diestrus to a relative maximum in proestrus. In contrast, SEC1 and FUT1 do not show prominently regulated expression in uterus. FUT2 expression localizes to luminal uterine epithelium by in situ hybridization, implying that this gene determines expression of cell surface Fucalpha1--&gt;2Galbeta epitopes proposed to mediate blastocyst adhesion.</str>

      <str>Previous investigations on the monkey kidney COS cell line demonstrated the weak expression of fucosylated cell surface antigens and presence of endogenous fucosyltransferase activities in cell extracts. RT-PCR analyses have now revealed expression of five homologs of human fucosyltransferase genes, FUT1, FUT4, FUT5, FUT7, and FUT8, in COS cell mRNA. The enzyme in COS cell extracts acting on unsialylated Type 2 structures is closely similar in its properties to the alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase encoded by human FUT4 gene and does not resemble the product of the FUT5 gene. Although FUT1 is expressed in the COS cell mRNA, it has not been possible to demonstrate alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity in cell extracts but the presence of Le(y) and blood-group A antigenic determinants on the cell surface imply the formation of H-precursor structures at some stage. The most strongly expressed fucosyltransferase in the COS cells is the alpha1,6-enzyme transferring fucose to the innermost N -acetylglucosamine unit in N -glycan chains; this enzyme is similar in its properties to the product of the human FUT8 gene. The enzymes resembling the human FUT4 and FUT8 gene products both had pH optima of 7.0 and were resistant to 10 mM NEM. The incorporation of fucose into asialo-fetuin was optimal at 5.5 and was inhibited by 10 mM NEM. This result initially suggested the presence of a third fucosyltransferase expressed in the COS cells but we have now shown that triantennary N- glycans with terminal nonreducing galactose units, similar to those present in asialo-fetuin, are modified by a weak endogenous beta-galactosidase in the COS cell extracts and thereby rendered suitable substrates for the alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase.</str>

RNAi knockdown studies of newly identified highly upregulated FUT1 and KLHDC7B genes provide evidence that their gene products regulate and facilitate HCV replication in hepatocytes. Our approach also identified novel Pol II unannotated transcripts that were upregulated.

      <str>Primary sensory neurons in the vertebrate olfactory systems are characterised by the differential expression of distinct cell surface carbohydrates. We show here that the histo-blood group H carbohydrate is expressed by primary sensory neurons in both the main and accessory olfactory systems while the blood group A carbohydrate is expressed by a subset of vomeronasal neurons in the developing accessory olfactory system. We have used both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to manipulate expression of these carbohydrates in the olfactory system. In null mutant mice lacking the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase FUT1, the absence of blood group H carbohydrate resulted in the delayed maturation of the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb. In addition, ubiquitous expression of blood group A on olfactory axons in gain-of-function transgenic mice caused mis-routing of axons in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb and led to exuberant growth of vomeronasal axons in the accessory olfactory bulb. These results provide in vivo evidence for a role of specific cell surface carbohydrates during development of the olfactory nerve pathways.</str>

      <str>Comparative analysis of allelic variation of a gene sheds light on the pattern and process of its diversification at the population level. Gene families for which a large number of allelic forms have been verified by sequencing provide a useful resource for such studies. In this regard, human blood group-encoding genes are unique in that differences of cell surface traits among individuals and populations can be readily detected by serological screening, and correlation between the variant cell surface phenotype and the genotype is, in most cases, unequivocal. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of allelic forms, compiled in the Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation database, of ABO, RHD/CE, GYPA/B/E and FUT1/2 gene families that encode the ABO, RH, MNS, and H/h blood group system antigens, respectively. These genes are excellent illustrative examples showing distinct mutational patterns among the alleles, and leading to speculation on how their origin may have been driven by recurrent but different molecular mechanisms. We illustrate how alignment of alleles of a gene may provide an additional insight into the DNA variation process and its pathways, and how this approach may serve to catalog alleles of a gene, simplifying the task and content of mutation databases.</str>

      <str>By referring to the split coding sequence of the highly conserved alpha 6-fucosyltransferase gene family (assumed to be representative of the common alpha 2 and alpha 6 fucosyltransferase gene ancestor), we have hypothesized that the monoexonic coding sequences of the present alpha 2-fucosyltransferase genes have been shaped in mammals by several events of retrotransposition and/or duplication. In order to test our hypothesis, we determined the structure of the three bovine alpha 2-fucosyltransferase genes (bfut1, bfut2, and sec1) and analyzed their characteristics compared with their human counterparts (FUT1, FUT2, and Sec1). We show that in mammals, a complex nonautonomous L1-retrotransposition event occurred within the locus of the alpha 2-fucosyltransferase ancestor gene itself. A consequence of this event was the processing in Catarrhini of a Sec1 pseudogene via several point mutations.</str>

      <str>In this study, we report the identification and characterisation of a novel carbonic anhydrase related-protein. We have determined that the full length coding sequence of an anonymous expressed sequenced tag, D19S799E, encodes a novel carbonic anhydrase related-protein (CARP-2) that is 328 amino acids in length. This peptide exhibits between 23.1-28.8% amino acid identity with the seven active human carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes. Four substitutions of key amino acids in the catalytic domain of CAs (equivalent to His94Arg, His96Leu, His119Gln, and Thr199Ser) are likely to render CARP-2 inactive as a carbonic anhydrase. Northern blot analysis of 23 human tissues indicates that CARP2 is expressed abundantly in the brain with moderate expression also present in spinal cord and thyroid. D19S799E (and thus CARP2) has previously been localised close to the polymorphic marker D19S412 and the genes DBP and FUT1/FUT2 on 19q13. 3.</str>

      <str>A multiplex DNA microarray chip aimed at the identification of allelic polymorphisms was developed for simultaneous detection of swine disease resistance genes underlying malignant hyperthermia (RYR), postweaning diarrhea, edema disease (FUT1), neonatal diarrhea (MUC4), and influenza (MX1). The on-chip detection was performed with fragmented polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified products. Particular emphasis was placed on the reduction of the number of PCR reactions required. The targets were biotin labeled during the PCR reaction, and the arrays were detected using a colorimetric methodology. Target recognition was provided by specific capture probes designed for each susceptible or resistant allelic variant. Sequencing was chosen as the gold standard to assess chip accuracy. All genotypes retrieved from the microarray (476) fit with sequencing data despite the fact that each pig was heterozygote for at least 1 target gene.</str>

      <str>Accumulation of histo-blood group antigens such as Lewis b, Lewis Y and H in colon cancer is indicative of poor prognosis. It is accompanied by increase in alpha1,2fucosyl-transferase activity, a key enzyme for synthesis of these antigens. Using a model of colon carcinoma, we previously showed that alpha1,2fucosylation increases tumorigenicity. We now show that tumorigenicity inversely correlates with the cells' sensitivity to apoptosis. In addition, poorly tumorigenic REG cells independently transfected with three different alpha1,2fucosyltransferase cDNAs, the human FUT1, the rat FTA and FTB were more resistant than control cells to apoptosis induced in vitro by serum deprivation. Inversely, PRO cells, spontaneously tumorigenic in immunocompetent syngeneic animals and able to synthesize alpha1,2fucosylated glycans, became more sensitive to apoptosis after transfection with a fragment of the FTA cDNA in the antisense orientation. Expression of alpha1,2fucosyl-transferase in poorly tumorigenic REG cells dramatically enhanced their tumorigenicity in syngeneic rats. However, in immunodeficient animals, both control and alpha1,2fuco-syltransferase transfected REG cells were fully tumorigenic and metastatic, indicating that the presence of alpha1,2fucosylated antigens allowed REG tumor cells to escape immune control. Taken together, the results show that increased tumorigenicity mediated by alpha1,2fucosyl-ation is associated to increased resistance to apoptosis and to escape from immune control.</str>

      <str>The existence of at least two distinct alpha 1,2fucosyltransferases has been postulated for many years, and recently confirmed in humans with the cloning of the human and rabbit secretor type alpha 1,2fucosyltransferase. We now describe the cloning and analysis of PFUT2, the pig secretor type alpha 1,2fucosyltransferase, which shows a high level of amino acid identity with previously cloned alpha 1,2fucosyltransferases, but more so with human and rabbit FUT2. Expression of PFUT2 in COS cells showed cell surface staining for H substance with UEAI lectin and anti-H monoclonal antibody, but not for A blood group substance. Kinetic studies were consistent with PFUT2 having a preference for type 1 and type 3 acceptors, as do the human and rabbit homologues, in contrast to PFUT1 which shows a preference for type 2 substrates. Like HuFUT1 and PFUT1, PFUT2 was able to dominate over the pig alpha 1,3galactosyltransferase in co-expression studies in COS cells and give preferential expression of H substance and reduced expression of Gal alpha (1,3)Gal. Cotransfection studies demonstrate that a combination of FUT1 and FUT2 cDNAs has an additive effect in suppressing expression of Gal alpha (1,3)Gal.</str>

      <str>The human secretor alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase encoded by the FUT2 determines the production of ABO(H) antigens in secretions. Recent studies demonstrated the presence of several nonfunctional alleles in the FUT2. During the analysis for inactivating mutations at the FUT2 locus from 24 Samoan and 47 Bangladeshi individuals, we found two distinct Alu-mediated deletions of FUT2. The FUT2 deletion in a Bangladeshi population was identical with that found in Indian individuals with the Bombay phenotype (se(del)), but not associated with the null allele (T725G) of the H gene (FUT1). The FUT2 deletion in Samoans is a novel null allele (se(del2)). The junction region of se(del2) was successfully amplified using the same primers for the se(del) amplification. DNA sequencing of the junction region of the se(del2) indicated that there was a 32-bp sequence identity between DNA sequences surrounding the 5' and 3' breakpoints. The size of the deletion of the se(del2) was 9.3 kb, including the full coding region of FUT2. The frequency of the se(del) in a Bangladeshi population was 0.074, and that of the se(del2) in a Samoan population was 0.104. Hum Mutat 16:274, 2000.</str>

      <str>Platelets express ABH antigens, which can adversely effect platelet transfusion recovery and survival in ABH-incompatible recipients. To date, there has been no large, comprehensive study comparing specific donor factors with ABH expression on platelet membranes and glycoconjugates. We studied ABH expression in 166 group A apheresis platelet donors by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and thin layer chromatography relative to donor age, sex, A1/A2 subgroup, and Lewis phenotype. Overall, A antigen on platelet membranes, glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids was linked to an A1 red blood cell (RBC) phenotype. Among A1 donors, platelet ABH varied significantly between donors (0%-87%). Intradonor variability, however, was minimal, suggesting that platelet ABH expression is a stable, donor-specific characteristic, with 5% of A1 donors typing as either ABH high- or low-expressers. Group A2 donors, in contrast, possessed a Bombay-like phenotype, lacking both A and H antigens. Unlike RBCs, ABH expression on platelets may be determined primarily by H-glycosyltransferase (FUT1) activity. Identification of A2 and A1 low expressers may increase the availability and selection of crossmatched and HLA-matched platelets. Platelets from group A2 may also be a superior product for patients undergoing A/O major mismatch allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation.</str>

      <str>Abnormalities in glycan biosynthesis have been conclusively linked to many diseases but the complexity of glycosylation has hindered the analysis of glycan data in order to identify glycoforms contributing to disease. To overcome this limitation, we developed a quantitative N-glycosylation model that interprets and integrates mass spectral and transcriptomic data by incorporating key glycosylation enzyme activities. Using the cancer progression model of androgen-dependent to androgen-independent Lymph Node Carcinoma of the Prostate (LNCaP) cells, the N-glycosylation model identified and quantified glycan structural details not typically derived from single-stage mass spectral or gene expression data. Differences between the cell types uncovered include increases in H(II) and Le(y) epitopes, corresponding to greater activity of α2-Fuc-transferase (FUT1) in the androgen-independent cells. The model further elucidated limitations in the two analytical platforms including a defect in the microarray for detecting the GnTV (MGAT5) enzyme. Our results demonstrate the potential of systems glycobiology tools for elucidating key glycan biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. The integration of multiple data sets represents an important application of systems biology for understanding complex cellular processes.</str>

      <str>EBV-miR-BART1 has been found to be highly expressed in some cancers including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but its exact roles in the pathogenesis of NPC remain unclear. Here, we did RNA deep sequencing to compare the gene expression profile between EBV-miR-BART1-expressing CNE1 cells and the control cells to determine the possible effects of EBV-miR-BART1 in NPC. Gene expression profiling analysis unexpectedly showed a significant number of up- and down-modulated metabolism-associated genes, such as G6PD, SAT1, ASS1, PAST1, FUT1, SGPL1, DHRS3, B4GALT1, PHGDH, IDH2, PISD, UGT8, LDHB and GALNT1, in EBV-miR-BART1-expressing NPC cells, which were next confirmed by RT-qPCR. Moreover, of these metabolism-genes, PSAT1 and PHGDH expression levels were significantly upregulated and most of other genes were obviously up-expressed in NPC specimens compared with chronic nasopharyngitis (CNP) tissues. Collectively, we for the first time found the effects of EBV-miR-BART1 on the expression of mechanism-associated genes in NPC, suggesting a novel role of EBV-miR-BART1 in cancer metabolism, which remains to be fully elucidated.</str>

KD susceptibility was assessed using the transmission disequilibrium test, whereas IVIG non-response was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. We replicated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three gene regions (FCGR, CD40/CDH22 and HLA-DQB2/HLA-DOB) that have been previously associated with KD and provide support to other findings of several novel SNPs in genes with a potential pathway in KD pathogenesis.

The tight correlation observed between the physical and the genetic orders of the microsatellites provide cytogenetic anchorages to the genetic map data.

Microsatellites, which can be identified by a standard PCR protocol, are useful tools for the localization of disease genes and for the establishment of YAC or cosmid contigs. These markers can also judiciously be used for the characterization of new hybrid cell line panels. We report such a characterization of 11 clones, 8 of which were obtained by irradiation-fusion.

Here, we show that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also induces sLe(x) expression dependent on induction of FUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 transcription in infected cells. HSV-1 induction of FUT5 was subsequently used as a model system for analyzing the mechanism of viral activation of dormant fucosyltransferase genes. We show that this is a rapid process, which gives rise to elevated FUT5 RNA levels already at 90 min postinfection. Augmented FUT5 transcription was found to be dependent on transcription of viral genes, but not dependent on the immediate early proteins ICP0 and ICP4, as demonstrated by experiments with HSV-1 mutants defective in expression of these genes. Augmented FUT5 transcription takes place in cycloheximide-treated HSV-1-infected cells, suggesting a more direct role for IE viral RNA during activation of cellular FUT5.</str>

      <str>Glycosylation of cellular proteins has important impact on their stability and functional properties, and glycan structures strongly influence cell adhesion. Many enzymes are involved in glycoconjugate synthesis and degradation, but there is only limited information about their role in breast cancer progression. Therefore, we retrieved RNA expression data of 202 glycosylation genes generated by microarray analysis (Affymetrix HG-U133A) in a cohort of 194 mammary carcinomas with long-term follow-up information. After univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, genes with independent prognostic value were identified. These were further analysed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests, and their prognostic value was validated in a second cohort of 200 tumour samples from patients without systemic therapy. In our first cohort, we identified 24 genes with independent prognostic value, coding for sixteen anabolic and eight catabolic enzymes. Functionally, these genes are involved in all important glycosylation pathways, namely O-glycosylation, N-glycosylation, O-fucosylation, synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids. Eighteen genes also showed prognostic significance in chemotherapy-treated patients. In the second cohort, six of the 24 relevant genes were of prognostic significance (FUT1, FUCA1, POFUT1, MAN1A1, RPN1 and DPM1), whereas a trend was observed for three additional probesets (GCNT4, ST3GAL6 and UGCG). In a stratified analysis of molecular subtypes combining both cohorts, great differences appeared suggesting a predominant role of N-glycosylation in luminal cancers and O-glycosylation in triple-negative ones. Correlations of gene expression with metastases of various localizations point to a role of glycan structures in organ-specific metastatic spread.

      <str>Dedifferentiation occurs naturally in mature cell types during epimorphic regeneration in fish and some amphibians. Dedifferentiation also occurs in the induction of pluripotent stem cells when a set of transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) is over expressed in mature cell types.</str>
      <str>We hypothesised that there are parallels between dedifferentiation or reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells and the natural process of dedifferentiation during epimorphic regeneration. We analysed expression levels of the most commonly used pluripotency associated factors in regenerating and non-regenerating tissue and compared them with levels in a pluripotent reference cell. We found that some of the pluripotency associated factors (oct4/pou5f1, sox2, c-myc, klf4, tert, sall4, zic3, dppa2/4 and fut1, a homologue of ssea1) were expressed before and during regeneration and that at least two of these factors (oct4, sox2) were also required for normal fin regeneration in the zebrafish. However these factors were not upregulated during regeneration as would be expected if blastema cells acquired pluripotency.</str>
      <str>By comparing cells from the regeneration blastema with embryonic pluripotent reference cells we found that induced pluripotent stem and blastema cells do not share pluripotency. However, during blastema formation some of the key reprogramming factors are both expressed and are also required for regeneration to take place. We therefore propose a link between partially reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells and the half way state of blastema cells and suggest that a common mechanism might be regulating these two processes.</str>

      <str>A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer (PC) because of its high specificity. However, elevated serum PSA does not occur only in PC but also in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Since the structural changes of N-glycans during carcinogenesis are common phenomena, we investigated whether PC-specific N-glycans are linked to PSA. We first analyzed the carbohydrate structures of PSA derived from seminal fluid, serum of BPH and PC patients, and PC cell line, namely, LNCaP using eight lectin-immobilized columns and then with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The fraction of serum PSA from PC patients bound to both Fucalpha1-2Gal and betaGalNAc binding Trichosanthes japonica agglutinin-II (TJA-II) column, while that from BPH patients did not exhibit this binding ability, thereby implying that there is elevated expression of alpha1,2-fucosylation and beta-N-acetylgalactosaminylation of PSA during carcinogenesis. We then performed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed that these structural changes were responsible for the elevated expression of fucosyltransferase I (FUT1) and beta-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 4(B4GALNT4). Second, we measured TJA-II-bound PSA contents and the binding ratios of TJA-II column chromatography in serum PSA samples from 40 patients of both PC and BPH. The results indicated that both TJA-II-bound PSA content and TJA-II binding ratios (%) could be used to discriminate between PC and BPH with more than 95% probability, and TJA-II-bound PSA can be regarded as a potential marker of PC.</str>

      <str>The secretor gene (FUT2) encodes an alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.69) that elaborates alpha(1,2)fucose residues on mucosal epithelium and secreted mucins. Though uterine alpha(1,2)fucosylated glycans have been proposed to be involved in embryo adhesion, mice with a homozygous null mutation of Fut2 displayed normal fertility. To help develop alternative hypotheses for function, the cell type and regulation of Fut2 expression during the estrous cycle, hormone replacement, and pregnancy was examined in Fut2-LacZ reporter mice containing targeted replacement of Fut2 with bacterial lacZ. LacZ expression in the reproductive tract of Fut2-LacZ mice is most prominent in the glandular epithelium of the endocervix during estrus and pregnancy. Nuclear LacZ expression identifies cell-specific expression of Fut2 in mucus-secreting cells of the endocervix, uterine glands, foveolar pit and chief cells of the stomach, and goblet cells of the colon. In ovariectomized Fut2-LacZ mice, estradiol treatment stimulates X-gal staining in endocervix and uterus but does not affect expression in stomach and colon. Northern blot analysis in wild-type mice shows 15-fold elevations of Fut2 steady-state mRNA with estradiol treatment, whereas Fut1 varies little. Fut2 levels in the glandular stomach and distal colon remain constant, and uterine Fut2 levels vary eightfold during the estrous cycle. These data represent the first demonstration of a glycosyltransferase gene under tissue-specific hormonal regulation in a LacZ reporter mouse model. Endocervical expression of Fut2 in estrus and pregnancy may modify cervical mucus barrier properties from microbial infection analogous to the potential role of mucosal glycans in humans.</str>

      <str>Cell surface molecules undergo specific changes during apoptosis, including the expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) and some proteins and alterations in sugar chains. Among the various sugar chains on the cell surface, Lewis X (Le(X)) and Lewis Y (Le(Y)) antigens are key determinants for a variety of biological processes. We studied the changes in Le(X) and Le(Y) expression in Jurkat cells, a human T cell line, during apoptosis. Flow cytometry showed that Le(X) and Le(Y) antigen expression was enhanced on the cell surface during apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody. To clarify the mechanism of enhanced Le(X) and Le(Y) expression, we assessed the expression levels of fucosyltransferase (FUT1, 2, 3-5-6, 4, and 9) mRNAs that are predominantly expressed in Jurkat cells and which are considered to form Le(X) and Le(Y). The expression of FUT4 mRNA was up-regulated after exposing cells to anti-Fas antibody. Moreover, the increase in Le(X) and Le(Y) antigen levels was significantly suppressed by caspase 3 or 8 inhibitors. These results indicated that the induction of FUT (mainly FUT4), the gene expression of which is mediated by signals downstream of caspase 3, increases Le(X) and Le(Y) expression in apoptotic cells.</str>

      <str>At weaning, the intestinal mucosa surface glycans change from predominantly sialylated to fucosylated. Intestinal adaptation from milk to solid food is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The contribution by glucocorticoid, an intrinsic factor, and colonization by microbiota, an extrinsic factor, was measured as the induction of α1,2/3-fucosyltransferase and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) activity and gene expression in conventionally raised, germ-free, and bacteria-depleted mice. In conventionally raised mice, cortisone acetate (CA) precociously accelerated SI gene expression up to 3 weeks and fut2 to 4 weeks of age. In germ-free mice, CA treatment induces only SI expression but not fucosyltransferase. In post-weaning bacteria-deficient (germ-free and bacteria-depleted) mice, fut2 expression remains at low suckling levels. In microbiota deficient mice, intestinal fut2 (but not fut1, fut4 or fut7) was induced only by adult microbiota, but not immature microbiota or CA. Fut2 induction could also be restored by colonization by Bacteroides fragilis, but not by a B. fragilis mutant unable to utilize fucose. Restoration of fut2 expression (by either microbiota or B. fragilis) in bacteria-depleted mice is necessary for recovery from dextran sulfate sodium-induced mucosal injury. Thus, glucocorticoids and microbes regulate distinct aspects of gut ontogeny: CA precociously accelerates SI expression and, only in colonized mice, fut2 early expression. The adult microbiota is required for the fut2 induction responsible for the highly fucosylated adult gut phenotype and is necessary for recovery from intestinal injury. Fut2-dependent recovery from inflammation may explain the high incidence of inflammatory disease (Crohn's and necrotizing enterocolitis) in populations with mutant FUT2 polymorphic alleles. </str>

      <str>Expression and implication of carbohydrate antigens in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in oral cavity was examined. In the cell lines, type 2H and Lewis y antigens were markedly expressed. In the tissues from SCC patients and benign disorders, type 2H was highly expressed in hyperplasia (96.4 %), displasia (92.9 %) and SCC (100 %). Lewis y was, in turn, expressed mainly in cancer tissues (91.3 %), suggesting that Lewis y is a cancer-associated antigen. Normal oral mucosa showed no expression of these blood group antigens. Surprisingly, Lewis y antigen disappeared in the invasion sites where Ki-67 was definitely stained. Over-expression of Lewis y with manipulation of a fucosyltransferase cDNA resulted in suppression of cell growth and invasion, and knockdown of Lewis y also brought about increased cell growth and invasion. In either situations, no changes in the expression of sialyl-Lewis x could be found. Lowered tumor growth and invasion into surrounding tissues were also shown in Lewis y-positive SCC grafts in nu/nu mice. All these results together with alternative staining between Lewis y and Ki-67 in cancer tissues and FUT1 transfectants suggested that loss of Lewis y is a crucial event for the late stage of SCCs. </str>

      <str>Monoclonal antibody-based treatments of cancer which serve as magic 'bullets' have been established as one of the most successful therapeutic strategies. A variety of antigens has been investigated as targets for the mAb therapy of gastric cancer, including the carbohydrate type 2 blood group antigen. Lewis Y (LeY) is overexpressed on tumor cells surface either as glycoproteins or glycolipids. LeY is difucosylated oligosaccharide with the chemical structure [Fucα1,2Galβ1→4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAcβ1→R], which is catalyzed by fucosyltransferases, such as FUT1 (α1,2) and FUT4 (α1,3). The role of LeY antigen in cancer treatment and prevention has been extensively studied. Moreover, the cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2) is an early event protein, highly expressed in H. pylori-related gastric cancer. COX-2 may play a pivotal part in the maintenance of tumor viability, growth, and metastasis. The COX-2 is upregulated in a variety of cancers, including gastric cancer. However, its inhibition may prevent or reverse gastric carcinogenesis. H. pylori mediated alteration of COX-2 through MAPKs pathway is one of the mechanisms that is implicated in gastric cancer. We have found COX-2 and LeY to be correlative sources of specific gastric biomarkers in gastric cancer, which is upregulated in the gastric cancer through MAPKs pathway. In addition, the anti-LeY antibody significantly downregulated the COX-2 expression through MAPKs pathway, helpful to the treatment of gastric cancer. In this review, we summarize the therapeutic effect of anti-LeY antibody, including the crucial role of COX-2 and LeY antigen in gastric cancer and discuss the COX-2 inhibition by anti-LeY antibody through MAPKs pathway. </str>

      <str>F18(+)Escherichia coli have the ability to colonize the gut and cause oedema disease or post-weaning diarrhoea by adhering to specific F18 receptors (F18R) on the porcine epithelium. Although it is well established that a DNA polymorphism on base pair 307 of the FUT1 gene, encoding an alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase, accounts for the F18R phenotype, the F18R nature is not elucidated yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between the presence of H-2 histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) or its derivative A-2 HBGAs on the porcine gut epithelium and F18(+)E. coli adherence. A significant positive correlation was found between expression of both the H-2 (r=0.586, P&lt;0.01) and A-2 (r=0.775, P&lt;0.01) HBGAs and F18(+)E. coli adherence after examination of 74 pigs aged from 0 to 23 weeks. The majority of the genetically resistant pigs (FUT1M307(A/A)) showed no HBGA expression (91.7%) and no F18(+)E. coli adherence (83.3%). In addition, it was found that F18R expression levels rise with increasing age during the first 3 weeks after birth and that F18R expression is maintained in older pigs (3-23 weeks old). Taken together, these data suggest that, apart from H-2 HBGAs, A-2 HBGAs might be involved in F18(+)E. coli adherence.</str>

      <str>Current polymerase chain reaction-based strategies for phenotype prediction often fail when sporadic nonfunctional alleles are encountered. The population frequency of such mutations was not known for any gene under low selection pressure and may be best examined in blood groups systems lacking prevalent nonfunctional alleles. The frequency of the very rare Bombay blood group (Oh, genotype hh sese) was recently determined in a systematic survey of more than 600,000 white individuals.</str>
      <str>With this survey used in conjunction with additional blood samples, the population frequency of nonfunctional alleles of the gene encoding the alpha (1,2)fucosyltransferase (H or FUT1) was determined.</str>
      <str>Seven different h alleles were found in five unrelated individuals, three of whom were homozygous for unique alleles. There was no prevalent h allele. Five missense and one frameshift mutations were observed, that were the presumptive causes of the null phenotype; the coding sequence of one h allele was identical to the H sequence. The average inbreeding factor alpha was 0.00116. The frequency of nonfunctional alleles at the H gene locus was calculated as 1 in 347 in a large white population (95% CI: 1:185-1:824).</str>
      <str>The Bombay blood group phenotype in white is due to diverse, sporadic, nonfunctional alleles without any prevalent allele. Assuming similar rates of nonfunctional alleles in glycosyltransferase genes like ABO, current genotyping strategies may fail as often as once in about 300 individuals of blood group O. Sporadic neutral alleles may also pose a serious obstacle for population-wide screening of many disease-associated genes.</str>

      <str>In this study, Agilent two-colour microarray-based gene expression profiling was used to detect differential gene expression in duodenal tissues collected from eight full-sib pairs of Sutai pigs differing in adhesion phenotype (sensitivity and resistance to Escherichia coli F18). Using a two-fold change minimum threshold, we found 18 genes that were differentially expressed (10 up-regulated and eight down-regulated) between the sensitive and resistant animal groups. Our gene ontology analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes are involved in a variety of biological processes, including immune responses, extracellular modification (e.g. glycosylation), cell adhesion and signal transduction, all of which are related to the anabolic metabolism of glycolipids, as well as to inflammation- and immune-related pathways. Based on the genes identified in the screen and the pathway analysis results, real-time PCR was used to test the involvement of ST3GAL1 and A genes (of glycolipid-related pathways), SLA-1 and SLA-3 genes (of inflammation- and immune-related pathways), as well as the differential genes FUT1, TAP1 and SLA-DQA. Subsequently, real-time PCR was performed to validate seven differentially expressed genes screened out by the microarray approach, and sufficient consistency was observed between the two methods. The results support the conclusion that these genes are related to the E. coli F18 receptor and susceptibility to E. coli F18.</str>

To elucidate an enzyme responsible for the ST2H antigen formation, we screened some partially purified candidate enzymes, alpha2,6-sialyltransferases, ST6Gal I and ST6Gal II, and alpha1,2-fucosyltransferases, FUT1 and FUT2 for their activities towards pyridylaminated type 2H (Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Glc-PA) or LS-tetrasaccharide c (LST-c: NeuAcalpha2-6Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Glc-PA) as acceptor substrates. Here we show the ST6Gal I transfers NeuAc from the donor CMP-NeuAc to the terminal Gal of PA-type 2H, which formed the ST2H antigen, but the others could not synthesize it. Using a recombinant ST6Gal I, enzymatic reactions with two types of acceptors, PA-type 2H and PA-lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), were kinetically analysed. On the basis of catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)), the specificity of ST6Gal I towards the PA-type 2H was estimated to be 42 times lower than that for PA-LNnT. The overexpression of ST6Gal I in human colon cancer DLD-1 cells effectively resulted in the ST2H antigen formation, as judged by LC-ESI-IT-MS. Many lines of evidence suggest the up-regulation of ST6Gal I in human colon cancer specimens. Collectively, these findings indicate that ST6Gal I is responsible for ST2H antigen biosynthesis in human colon cancer cells.</str>

      <str>The penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the human ABO blood group oligosaccharide antigens is catalyzed by alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase(s) (GDP-L-fucose: beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.69), whose expression is determined by the H and Secretor (SE) blood group loci (also known as FUT1 and FUT2, respectively). These enzymes construct Fuc alpha 1--&gt;2Gal beta-linkages, known as H determinants, which are essential precursors to the A and B antigens. Erythrocytes from individuals with the rare Bombay and para-Bombay blood group phenotypes are deficient in H determinants, and thus A and B determinants, as a consequence of apparent homozygosity for null alleles at the H locus. We report a molecular analysis of a human alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene, thought to correspond to the H blood group locus, in a Bombay pedigree and a para-Bombay pedigree. We find inactivating point mutations in the coding regions of both alleles of this gene in each H-deficient individual. These results define the molecular basis for H blood group antigen deficiency in Bombay and para-Bombay phenotypes, provide compelling evidence that this gene represents the human H blood group locus, and strongly support a hypothesis that the H and SE loci represent distinct alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase genes. Candidate sequences for the human SE locus are identified by low-stringency Southern blot hybridization analyses, using a probe derived from the H alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene.</str>

      <str>The expression of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferases that catalyze the fucose transfer to galactose of the N-acetyl(iso)lactosamine chain is decreased in human metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. alpha(2,3) Sialyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sialic acid to the same substrate to form, with alpha(1,3/1,4) fucosyltransferases, sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis x determinants on cell surface that are involved in pancreatic metastatic invasion. The aim of this study was to determine whether this decrease of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase expression can favor the alpha(2,3) sialyltransferase activity to form metastatic sialyl-Lewis antigens. Restoration of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase activity in the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 was obtained by selecting stable transfectants expressing FUT1. Overexpression of FUTI in BxPC-3 cells resulted in a substantial reduction of sialyl-Lewis antigen expression that correlated with an increase of expression of Lewis y and H-type antigens on cell surface. The modified oligosaccharide structures were preferentially restricted to three major glycoproteins, which could in part be related to mucin-type glycoproteins. The reduction of sialyl-Lewis antigen expression was associated with an inhibition of adhesive properties to E-selectin and a decrease of gastrointestinal metastatic power of BxPC-3 cells after xenograft transplantation into nude mice. This study provides evidence that the expression level of alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase may regulate the expression of sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis x antigens and consequently could play an important role in metastatic properties of human pancreatic cancer cells.</str>

We thus developed a method to synthesize this hexaose enzymatically. First, beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta-1,3-GnT) was partially purified from bovine blood by an established method. Using this enzyme preparation, d-GlcNAc was attached to the d-galactose residue of lactose with a beta-1,3-linkage to produce lacto-N-triose II at 44% yield. The low yield was thought to be due to contaminating N-acetylglucosaminidase that would have hydrolyzed the product, lacto-N-triose II. Next, d-galactose was attached by transglycosylation using ortho-nitrophenyl beta-d-galactopyranoside as a donor with the aid of recombinant beta-1,3-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans to generate lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) at 22% yield. l-Fucose was then linked to the d-galactose residue of LNT via an alpha-1,2-linkage using recombinant human fucosyltransferase I (FUT1) expressed in a baculovirus system (71% yield). The obtained pentasaccharide was subsequently incubated with GDP-beta-l-fucose and commercial fucosyltransferase III (FUT3) to attach l-fucose to the d-GlcNAc residue of LNT with an alpha-1,4-linkage. After purification with an activated carbon column chromatography, 1.7 mg of LNDFH I was obtained (85% yield). We thus produced LNDFH I over four enzymatic steps with a yield of 6%.</str>

      <str>The Rhesus (Rh) gene superfamily in humans and mice contains four independent genes, RH, RHAG, RHBG, and RHCG/GK. Heretofore, only the RHBG cDNA has been cloned in pig. We have isolated the porcine RH cDNA; its complete open reading frame of 1269 nucleotides encoded 423 amino acids. Porcine RH protein shared 67.6% amino acid identity with bovine RH, 61.0% with human RhCE and 60.8% with human RhD. The RT-PCR revealed RH transcripts in the spleen and bone marrow, but not in the heart, kidney, or lung. In RH intron 4, a deletion of 17 nucleotides distinguished the shorter allele (allele 1) from the longer. As determined in 115 unrelated pigs from five breeds - Landrace (L, n = 23), Large White (LW, n = 28), Duroc (D, n = 24), Hampshire (H, n = 20) and Piétrain (n = 20) - allele 1 frequencies were 1.0 (L, H), 0.77 (LW), 0.70 (P) and 0.25 (D). Somatic cell hybrid mapping localized the porcine RH and RHBG genes to pig chromosomes 6q22-q23 and 4q21-q22, respectively. Genetic mapping suggested RH-(FUT1, S, GPI, EAH, A1BG)-PGD as the most probable locus order. Sequence homology, mapping data, and haematopoietic tissue expression suggest that this cDNA may indeed encode the porcine RH homologue.</str>

      <str>Accumulation of histo-blood group antigens such as Lewis b, Lewis Y and H increases tumor cell motility and tumorigenesis. Alpha1,2-fucosylation is a key step in the synthesis of these antigens. Two alpha1,2-fucosyltransferases, expressed in colorectal carcinomas, have been characterized (FUT1 and FUT2 in humans, FTA and FTB in rats). To define the relative contribution of each of these enzymes in tumor cell behavior, we have used an anti-sense transfection approach in rat colon carcinoma PROb cells, which synthesize mRNA encoding for both enzymes. We have previously reported that anti-sense transfection of a cDNA fragment of the FTB enzyme decreased H antigenic cell-surface levels and concomitantly decreased tumorigenicity. H antigens, detected by antibodies specific for H type 1, 3 or 4, were detected only on a splice variant of CD44 containing the product of exon v6. We now report the anti-sense transfection of an FTA cDNA fragment into PROb cells, which resulted in decreased enzymatic activity on a type 2 precursor and decreased cell-surface H type 2 antigen exclusively. Compared to controls, FTA anti-sense-transfected cells were significantly more tumorigenic in syngeneic animals but not in immunodeficient SCID mice. The UEA-I lectin, specific for H type 2, revealed that these structures were present on the CD44v6 variant and on an uncharacterized 80-kDa glycoprotein. Our results indicate that FTA and FTB fucosylate distinct glycan chains in the same cell, leading to opposite effects, under control of the immune system.</str>

      <str>Macrophages accumulate within stromal tissue subjacent to the luminal epithelium in the mouse uterus during early pregnancy after seminal fluid exposure at coitus. To investigate their role in regulating epithelial cell expression of fucosylated structures required for embryo attachment and implantation, fucosyltransferase enzymes Fut1, Fut2 (Enzyme Commission number [EC] 2.4.1.69), and Fut4 (EC 2.4.1.214) and Muc1 and Muc4 mRNAs were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR in uterine epithelial cells after laser capture microdissection in situ or after epithelial cell coculture with macrophages or macrophage-secreted factors. When uterine macrophage recruitment was impaired by mating with seminal plasma-deficient males, epithelial cell Fut2 expression on Day 3.5 postcoitus (pc) was reduced compared to intact-mated controls. Epithelial cell Fut2 was upregulated in vitro by coculture with macrophages or macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM). Macrophage-derived cytokines LIF, IL1B, and IL12 replicated the effect of MCM on Fut2 mRNA expression, and MCM-stimulated expression was inhibited by anti-LIF and anti-IL1B neutralizing antibodies. The effects of acute macrophage depletion on fucosylated structures detected with lectins Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA-1) and Lotus tetragonolobus purpureas (LTP), or LewisX immunoreactivity, were quantified in vivo in Cd11b-dtr transgenic mice. Depletion of macrophages caused a 30% reduction in luminal epithelial UEA-1 staining and a 67% reduction in LewisX staining in uterine tissues of mice hormonally treated to mimic early pregnancy. Together, these data demonstrate that uterine epithelial Fut2 mRNA expression and terminal fucosylation of embryo attachment ligands is regulated in preparation for implantation by factors including LIF and IL1B secreted from macrophages recruited during the inflammatory response to insemination.</str>

      <str>ABO blood group is determined by carbohydrate antigens, called ABH antigens. It has been known that the change of carbohydrate antigen expression, including ABH antigens, has correlation with the tumor metastasis and survival; however, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. ABH antigens are expressed not only in blood cells but also in several tissues. In epidermis, ABH antigen is expressed in the uppermost spinous and granular layer. We investigated the role of ABH antigens on the cell migration of HaCaT keratinocytes, which express B antigen. Knock-down of B antigen expression by small interference RNA of FUT1 inhibited HaCaT cell migration. At that time, we found that lamellipodia and actin fiber were also reduced by knock-down of B antigen expression. The transcription of cdc42, a kind of Rho GTPase which plays a key role in actin polymerization, was reduced by down-regulated B antigen expression. Furthermore, the reduced B antigen expression also inhibited the interaction of cdc42 and N-WASP. Collectively, our data provide a clue how ABH antigens regulate the cell migration mechanism.</str>

      <str>RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus), a virulent calicivirus, causes high mortalities in European rabbit populations (Oryctolagus cuniculus). It uses α1,2fucosylated glycans, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), as attachment factors, with their absence or low expression generating resistance to the disease. Synthesis of these glycans requires an α1,2fucosyltransferase. In mammals, there are three closely located α1,2fucosyltransferase genes rSec1, rFut2 and rFut1 that arose through two rounds of duplications. In most mammalian species, Sec1 has clearly become a pseudogene. Yet, in leporids, it does not suffer gross alterations, although we previously observed that rabbit Sec1 variants present either low or no activity. Still, a low activity rSec1 allele correlated with survival to an RHDV outbreak. We now confirm the association between the α1,2fucosyltransferase loci and survival. In addition, we show that rabbits express homogenous rFut1 and rFut2 levels in the small intestine. Comparison of rFut1 and rFut2 activity showed that type 2 A, B and H antigens recognized by RHDV strains were mainly synthesized by rFut1, and all rFut1 variants detected in wild animals were equally active. Interestingly, rSec1 RNA levels were highly variable between individuals and high expression was associated with low binding of RHDV strains to the mucosa. Co-transfection of rFut1 and rSec1 caused a decrease in rFut1-generated RHDV binding sites, indicating that in rabbits, the catalytically inactive rSec1 protein acts as a dominant-negative of rFut1. Consistent with neofunctionalization of Sec1 in leporids, gene conversion analysis showed extensive homogenization between Sec1 and Fut2 in leporids, at variance with its limited degree in other mammals. Gene conversion additionally involving Fut1 was also observed at the C-terminus. Thus, in leporids, unlike in most other mammals where it became extinct, Sec1 evolved a new function with a dominant-negative effect on rFut1, contributing to fucosylated glycan diversity, and allowing herd protection from pathogens such as RHDV. </str>

      <str>β1,4-Galactosyltransferase I (β1,4-GalT-I), a key enzyme in glycobiology, mediates several biological mechanisms. However, the correlation between β-1,4-GalT-I expression in the uterine endometrium and embryo implantation remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between β1,4-GalT-I and Lewis(Y) (Le(Y)) glycan during embryo implantation. So far, using green fluorescent protein as an indicator, β1,4-GalT-I interference plasmid (pcDNA3.0-siGalT I), overexpression plasmid (pcDNA3.0-HA-GalT I), interference control plasmid (control pcDNA3.0-siGalT I), and empty vector (pcDNA3.0) were transfected into human uterine epithelial RL95-2 cells that imitate the receptive endometrium. Invasive embryos at pre-implantation and treated RL95-2 cells were co-cultured to determine embryo attachment in each of the transfection groups. The results showed that plasmid transfection was successful in all the groups. β1,4-GalT-I and Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) gene expression declined in the interference group, and the synthesis of Le(Y) decreased accordingly, but the expression of this antigen increased in the overexpression group. After co-culturing of the embryos and 36h transfection of RL95-2, the results of these in vitro implantation models showed that the attachment rate was lower in the interference group (30.0 ± 0.2%) than in the untreated group (50.0 ± 0.6%), empty vector group (50.0 ± 0.2%), and interference control group (46.7 ± 0.6%), however, it was highest in the overexpression group (70.0 ± 0.2%). These results indicated that β1,4-galactosyltransferase I possibly regulate mutual uterus-embryo adhesion and embryo implantation by regulating cell surface Le(Y) glycan expression.</str>

      <str>Mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is a potent promoter of tissue growth and regeneration, whilst unloading in microgravity can cause reduced tissue regeneration, possibly through effects on stem cell tissue progenitors. To test the specific hypothesis that mechanical unloading alters differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell lineages, we studied cellular and molecular aspects of how bone marrow in the mouse proximal femur responds to unloading in microgravity. Trabecular and cortical endosteal bone surfaces in the femoral head underwent significant bone resorption in microgravity, enlarging the marrow cavity. Cells isolated from the femoral head marrow compartment showed significant down-regulation of gene expression markers for early mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation, including FUT1(-6.72), CSF2(-3.30), CD90(-3.33), PTPRC(-2.79), and GDF15(-2.45), but not stem cell markers, such as SOX2. At the cellular level, in situ histological analysis revealed decreased megakaryocyte numbers whilst erythrocytes were increased 2.33 fold. Furthermore, erythrocytes displayed elevated fucosylation and clustering adjacent to sinuses forming the marrow-blood barrier, possibly providing a mechanistic basis for explaining spaceflight anemia. Culture of isolated bone marrow cells immediately after microgravity exposure increased the marrow progenitor's potential for mesenchymal differentiation into in-vitro mineralized bone nodules, and hematopoietic differentiation into osteoclasts, suggesting an accumulation of undifferentiated progenitors during exposure to microgravity. These results support the idea that mechanical unloading of mammalian tissues in microgravity is a strong inhibitor of tissue growth and regeneration mechanisms, acting at the level of early mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. </str>

      <str>We observed previously that each of seven cancer progression inhibitors suppresses the mRNA expression of some matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but stimulates that of others, in breast cancer cells. In the present study we tested the effect of overexpressing other cancer modulators on MMP expression. The MMPs tested are MMP1, MMP2, MMP7, MMP13, MMP14, MMP16, MMP19, and MMP25. The proteins that were overexpressed are cancer inhibitors (NME, DRG1, IL10), enhancers (SOD2, FAK, IL17, and CREB), and proteins that suppress cancer progression in cells of some cancers and promote it in others (FUT1, integrin beta3, serpin E1, TIAM1, and claudin 4). Unexpectedly, all of them only lowered MMP mRNA expression, mainly of MMP16, MMP2, and MMP13, in breast cancer cells. Signaling from SOD2 uncoupled the accumulation of two MMP16 mRNA splice variants, suggesting signaling to a late step in MMP16 mRNA accumulation, such as MMP16 mRNA stabilization or late mRNA processing. Signaling that modulates MMP expression differed widely among the total population of MDA-MB-231 cells and single-cell progenies cloned from that population. It also differed substantially between cells of two metastatic breast basal adenocarcinomas, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. The present study detected 37 new signaling pathways from cancer progression modulators located upstream of MMP mRNA expression in human breast cancer cells. Our siRNA-induced MMP knockdown data support the interpretation that signaling from MMP19, MMP1, MMP7, MMP12, MMP14, and MMP11 each stimulates the mRNA expression of other MMPs in breast cancer cells.</str>

      <str>A cohort of 241 blood group A donors was analysed by flow cytometry. Although mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is a typical continuous variable, platelets were screened and divided into two categories: low expressers (LEs) and high expressers (HEs). A three-generation family was investigated looking for an inheritance mechanism.</str>
      <str>The prevalence of the HE platelet phenotype among group A(1) donors was 2%. The mean of MFI on platelets of A(1) subgroup of EUBs differs from that of AFBs (P = 0·0115), whereas the frequency of the HE phenotype was similar between them (P = 0·5251). A significant difference was found between sexes (P = 0·0039). Whereas the serum glycosyltransferase from HE family members converted significantly more H antigen on group O erythrocytes into A antigens compared with that in LE serum, their ABO, FUT1 and FUT2 genes were consensus. The theoretically favourable, transcriptionally four-repeat ABO enhancer was not observed.</str>
      <str>The occurrence of HE in several members suggests familial aggregation. Indeed, in repeated measures, stability of the MFI values is suggesting an inherited condition. Factors outside the ABO locus might be responsible for the HE phenotype.

      <str>The tissue-specific and species-specific expression of the ABH antigens is well known among vertebrate species and it is regulated by the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase that forms the H antigen, a precursor of the A and B antigens. To investigate the mechanisms governing the tissue-specific and species-specific expression of this alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase, we characterized the gene structure, including the promoter region, of FTA, a rat orthologous homolog of human FUT1 that encodes the H alpha(1, 2)fucosyltransferase and is responsible for the expression of the ABH antigens on human red blood cells. Northern blot and 5'-RACE analyses suggested that at least two forms of FTA mRNA (2.9 and 2.6 kb), which use alternative transcription start sites, are present in the cancer cell lines RCN-9 (rat colon cancer) and PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma), whereas only the 2.6 kb form was detected in normal colon, stomach and pancreas. Transcriptional activity of the 5'-flanking sequence, which contains three putative Sp1-binding sites, but lacks both TATA and CAAT boxes, was examined. Transient transfection experiments of promoter-reporter gene constructs showed high promoter activity in RCN-9, PC12 and human colon cancer (WiDr) cell lines, weak activity in human vascular endothelial (ECV304) cells and no activity in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. The results suggest that the 5'-flanking region of FTA contains a tissue-specific promoter. Deletional analysis of the 5'-flanking sequence revealed regions containing cell-type-specific positive acting element(s) and negative regulatory element(s), which are related to the promoter activity.</str>

      <str>Sialyl Lewis A (SLe(a)), Lewis A (Le(a)), and Lewis B (Le(b)) have been studied in many different biological contexts, for example in microbial adhesion and cancer. Their biosynthesis is complex and involves beta1,3-galactosyltransferases (beta3Gal-Ts) and a combined action of alpha2- and/or alpha4-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-Ts). Further, O-glycans with different core structures have been identified, and the ability of beta3Gal-Ts and Fuc-Ts to use these as substrates has not been resolved. Therefore, to examine the in vivo specificity of enzymes involved in SLe(a), Le(a), and Le(b) synthesis, we have transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells with relevant human glycosyltransferases and, on secreted reporter proteins, detected the resulting Lewis antigens on N- and O-linked glycans using western blotting and Le-specific antibodies. beta3Gal-T1, -T2, and -T5 could synthesize type 1 chains on N-linked glycans, but only beta3Gal-T5 worked on O-linked glycans. The latter enzyme could use both core 2 and core 3 precursor structures. Furthermore, the specificity of FUT5 and FUT3 in Le(a) and Le(b) synthesis was different, with FUT5 fucosylating H type 1 only on core 2, but FUT3 fucosylating H type 1 much more efficient on core 3 than on core 2. Finally, FUT1 and FUT2 were both found to direct alpha2-fucosylation on type 1 chains on both N- and O-linked structures. This knowledge enables us to engineer recombinant glycoproteins with glycan- and core chain-specific Lewis antigen substitution. Such tools will be important for investigations on the fine carbohydrate specificity of Le(b)-binding lectins, such as Helicobacter pylori adhesins and DC-SIGN, and may also prove useful as therapeutics.</str>

      <str>Conserved amino acid motifs are found in numerous expressed genes. Proteins and peptides with functional relationships may be identified using probes designed to hybridize with these motifs. An oligonucleotide probe was prepared to match the sequence of the expected active region of a frog corticotropin-releasing factor-like peptide sauvagine and used to screen a sheep brain cDNA library. A novel 1331-bp cDNA encoding a putative 328-residue protein with a theoretical mass of 36 kDa was identified. The presence of a strong signal sequence indicates that it is a secreted protein. The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are characterized by several potential phosphorylation sites and binding motifs, suggesting a role in intracellular signal transduction. Although the protein possesses a 7-residue sequence identical to that found in sauvagine, its overall primary structure most closely resembles those of the alpha-carbonic anhydrases (alpha-CAs). Moreover, the detection of the human and mouse orthologues in the EST databases, together with an evolutionary analysis, indicates that the protein represents a new member of the alpha-CA gene family, which we designate carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI (CA-RP XI), encoded by CA11 (human) and Car11 (mouse, rat). The human CA11 gene appears to be located between the secretor type alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase gene cluster (FUT1-FUT2-FUT2P) and the D-site binding protein gene (DBP) on chromosome 19q13.3. Despite potentially inactivating changes in the active-site residues, CA-RP XI is evolving very slowly in mammals, a property indicative of an important function, which has also been observed in the two other "acatalytic" CA isoforms, CA-RP VIII and CA-RP X, whose functions are unknown.</str>

MAb 3A5 was specific for H Type 2, and MAb 1E3 reacted with each of H Type 1-H Type 4 artificial antigens. We have developed a competitive inhibition method against H Type 2 and have obtained MAb 1E3, which is fairly specific for H Type 1 under certain conditions. Mucous cells from secretors were strongly stained by 1E3 and weakly by 3A5, whereas those from nonsecretors showed no reaction with 1E3 and 3A5. Serous cells from both secretors and nonsecretors were stained neither by 1E3 nor by 3A5. Striated and interlobular duct cells were strongly stained by 1E3 and by 3A5, regardless of the secretor status. These results indicated that the expressions of the H Type 1 and H Type 2 in different cell types of the submandibular gland were controlled by different genes. In addition, we have determined the acceptor specificity of two alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferases (H and Se enzymes) after transient expressions of the FUT1 and FUT2 in COS7 cells, and found that the H enzyme activity was similar for both Type 1 and Type 2 precursors, and that Se enzyme activity with the Type 1 precursor was higher than that with the Type 2 precursor. Expression of the H Type 1 antigen in mucous cells was found to be dependent on the Se gene, whereas expressions of the H Type 1 and H Type 2 antigens in striated and interlobular duct cells were dependent on the H gene.

These carbohydrate determinants can be synthesized by sequential action of alpha(2,3) sialyltransferases or alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferases (Fuc-T) and alpha(1,3/1,4) fucosyltransferases on (poly)N-acetyllactosamine chains. Therefore, the expression and the function of seven fucosyltransferases were investigated in normal and cancer pancreatic tissues and in four pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Transcripts of FUT1, FUT2, FUT3, FUT4, FUT5, and FUT7 were detected by RT-PCR in carcinoma cell lines as well as in normal and tumoral tissues. Interestingly, the FUT6 message was only detected in tumoral tissues. Analysis of the acceptor substrate specificity for fucosyltransferases indicated that alpha(1,2) Fuc-T, alpha(1,3) Fuc-T, and alpha(1,4) Fuc-T were expressed in microsome preparations of all tissues as demonstrated by fucose incorporation into phenyl beta-d-galactoside, 2'-fucosyllactose, N-acetyllactosamine, 3'-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, and lacto-N-biose. However, these fucosyltransferase activities varied between tissues. A substantial decrease of alpha(1,2) Fuc-T activity was observed in tumoral tissues and cell lines compared to normal tissues. Conversely, the activity of alpha(1,4) Fuc-T, which generates Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis a structures, and that of alpha(1,3) Fuc-T, able to generate a lactodifucotetraose structure, were very important in SOJ-6 and BxPC-3 cell lines. These increases correlated with an enhanced expression of Lewis a, sialyl-Lewis a, and Lewis y on the cell surface. The activity of alpha(1,3) Fuc-T, which participates in the synthesis of the sialyl-Lewis x structure, was not significantly modified in cell lines compared to normal tissues. However, the sialyl-Lewis x antigen was expressed preferentially on the surface of SOJ-6 and BxPC-3 cell lines but was not detected on Panc-1 and MiaPaca-2 cell lines suggesting that several alpha(1,3) Fuc-T might be involved in sialyl-Lewis x synthesis.</str>

      <str>Lex [Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc] and Ley [Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc] are both stage-specific embryonic antigens. Lex is first detected on the blastomeres of the 8-cell stage embryo, which correlates with the onset of blastomere compaction. Ley is highly expressed on the surface of the blastocyst, which has been shown to be involved in blastocyst attachment in the mouse. In the present study, mouse alpha1,2-FT (also known as FUT1) and alpha1,3-FT (also known as Fuc-TIV), which were responsible for Lex and Ley formation, were examined in preimplantation stage embryos by reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization. alpha1,3-FT mRNA was detected in all embryos of preimplantation stage, while alpha1,2-FT mRNA emerged in the later stage embryos from 8-cell to 16-cell to the blastocyst. These results indicated the expression of Ley was regulated by alpha1,2-FT. In situ hybridization showed that these two enzyme mRNAs were detected only in morula and blastocyst stage embryos. The alpha1,2-FT and alpha1, 3-FT mRNAs were located in both the inner cell mass and the trophoblast cells. 2-Cell and 4-cell embryos were isolated from the oviduct and cultured in vitro to the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stage. The expression of alpha1,2-FT and alpha1,3-FT were observed in these embryos developed in vitro; immunohistochemical analysis also showed that Ley expression was positive. These results suggested the stage-specific expression of Ley on the embryos was synthesized by endogenous alpha1,2-FT and alpha1,3-FT rather than transfer from other sources. In addition, the expression of alpha1, 2-FT was differentially regulated and the uterine factor was not prerequisite of the expression of Ley.</str>

      <str>ABO blood serotype A is known to be associated with risk of gastric cancer (GC), but little is known how ABO alleles and the fucosyltransferase (FUT) enzymes and genes which are involved in Lewis antigen formation [and in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) binding and pathogenicity] may be related to GC risk in a European population. The authors conducted an investigation of 32 variants at ABO and FUT1-7 loci and GC risk in a case-control study of 365 cases and 1,284 controls nested within the EPIC cohort (the EPIC-Eurgast study). Four variants (including rs505922) in ABO, and allelic blood group A (AO+AA, odds ratio=1.84, 95%CI=1.20-2.80) were associated with diffuse-type GC; however, conditional models with other ABO variants indicated that the associations were largely due to allelic blood group A. One variant in FUT5 was also associated with diffuse-type GC, and four variants (and haplotypes) in FUT2 (Se), FUT3 (Le) and FUT6 with intestinal-type GC. Further, one variant in ABO, two in FUT3 and two in FUT6 were associated with H. pylori infection status in controls, and two of these (in FUT3 and FUT6) were weakly associated with intestinal-type GC risk. None of the individual variants surpassed a Bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of 0.0016; however, after a gene-based permutation test, two loci [FUT3(Le)/FUT5/FUT6 and FUT2(Se)] were significantly associated with diffuse- and intestinal-type GC, respectively. Replication and functional studies are therefore recommended to clarify the role of ABO and FUT alleles in H. pylori infection and subtype-specific gastric carcinogenesis.</str>
