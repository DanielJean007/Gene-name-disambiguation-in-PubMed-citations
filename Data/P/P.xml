      <str>Phosphorous (P) fraction characteristics in sediment resuspension were investigated under adequately hydrodynamic conditions. Four forms of P in overlying water, including dissolved inorganic P, dissolved total P, total P, and particulate P, and six fractions of P in suspended particulate matter (SPM), including loosely sorbed P (NH4Cl-P), redox-sensitive P (BD-P), aluminum-bound P (Al-P), organic P (NaOH-nrP), calcium-bound P (Ca-P) and residual P (Res-P), were quantified, respectively. Different hydrodynamic conditions resulted in different P form changes. Four states could be ascribed: (1) P desorption by sediment and SPM, and P adsorption by overlying water; (2) P desorption by SPM, and P adsorption by overlying water; (3) P adsorption by SPM, and P desorption by overlying water; and (4) P equilibrium between SPM and overlying water. The contents of P in overlying water acquired peak values in the middle position of the vertical P distribution due to the combined actions of SPM and sediment. P fractions in SPM were in the following order: BD-P &gt; NaOH-nrp &gt; Ca-P &gt; Al-P &gt; Res-P &gt; NH4Cl-P. BD-P in SPM frequently exchanged with P forms in overlying water. Resuspension was favorable to forming Ca-P in SPM.</str>

      <str>Series of cyclic amides containing optically active helicene, (P)-1,12-dimethylbenzo[c]phenanthrene, are synthesized using a building block method. The building block consists of one (P)-helicene unit and one dianiline unit with its amino-terminal-protected with benzyloxycarbonyl and its acid terminal activated as acid chloride. The coupling with (P,P....)-[(n - 3) + (n - 2)]diamine followed by deprotection gives (P,P....)-[(n - 1) + n]diamine, which possesses n - 1 parts of (P)-helicene and n parts of dianiline. Cyclization of the (P,P....)-[(n - 1) + n]diamine with helicenediacid dichloride gives (P,P....)-[n + n]cycloamide. All the members of (P,P)-[2 + 2]cycloamide to (P,P,P,P,P,P,P,P,P,P)-[10 + 10]cycloamide are synthesized using this method, and are compared spectroscopically.</str>

      <str>The translocation of different inorganic phosphorus (Pi) forms in a low-P soil (Langfang experimental station, Hebei province, China) over time was investigated using P fractionation extraction and a (32)P tracer technique. The L-value and P availability of the soil was assessed using 5 different maize genotype (Zea mays L.) cultivars. The results showed that the different Pi fractions in the soil increased in the order of H(2)SO(4)-extractable P (Ca(10)-P) &gt; Na(3)C(6)H(5)O(7)-Na(2)S(2)O(4)-extractable P (O-P) &gt; NH(4)Ac-extractable P (Ca(8)-P) &gt; NaHCO(3)-extractable P (Ca(2)-P), NH(4)F-extractable P (Al-P), NaOH-Na(2)CO(3)-extractable P (Fe-P), and the content of plant-unavailable P (Ca(10)-P + O-P) was high, up to 79.1%, which might be an important reason for P deficiency in this low-P soil. The (32)P tracer results showed that after the addition of (32)P-Pi to the soil with no P fertilizer applied for 25 d, 29.0% of (32)P was quickly transformed into Ca(2)-P (rapidly available P), and 66.1% of (32)P was transformed into Al-P, Fe-P and Ca(8)-P (slowly available P). Only 5.0% of (32)P was transformed into O-P and Ca(10)-P (plant-unavailable P). Moreover, in the soil with P fertilizer applied, (32)P transformation into Ca(2)-P increased, and the transformation into Ca(8)-P + Fe-P + AL-P and O-P, Ca(10)-P significantly decreased compared to the soil with no P fertilizer applied (p &lt; 0.05). This result suggested a higher rate for water-soluble P transformation to slowly available and plant-unavailable P in P deficient soil than in soil with sufficient P. The results of maize L-value determination showed that different genotype maize cultivars had different soil P-use efficiency and low-P tolerance mechanisms. Low-P tolerant cultivar DSY-32 regulated soil P-use efficiency and plant P content according to exogenous P fertilizer application. However, another low-P tolerant cultivar, DSY-2, used soil P more efficiently, regardless of the application of exogenous P.</str>

      <str>Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Pseudomonas: was conducted by using the combined gyrB and rpoD nucleotide sequences of 31 validly described species of Pseudomonas: (a total of 125 strains). Pseudomonas: strains diverged into two major clusters designated intrageneric cluster I (IGC I) and intrageneric cluster II (IGC II). IGC I was further split into two subclusters, the 'P: aeruginosa complex', which included P: aeruginosa, P: alcaligenes, P: citronellolis, P: mendocina, P: oleovorans and P: pseudoalcaligenes, and the 'P: stutzeri complex', which included P: balearica and P: stutzeri. IGC II was further split into three subclusters that were designated the 'P: putida complex', the 'P: syringae complex' and the 'P: fluorescens complex'. The 'P: putida complex' included P: putida and P: fulva. The 'P: syringae complex' was the cluster of phytopathogens including P: amygdali, P: caricapapayae, P: cichorii, P: ficuserectae, P: viridiflava and the pathovars of P. savastanoi and P. syringae. The 'P. fluorescens complex' was further divided into two subpopulations, the 'P. fluorescens lineage' and the 'P. chlororaphis lineage'. The 'P. fluorescens lineage' contained P. fluorescens biotypes A, B and C, P. azotoformans, P. marginalis pathovars, P. mucidolens, P. synxantha and P. tolaasii, while the 'P. chlororaphis lineage' included P. chlororaphis, P. agarici, P. asplenii, P. corrugata, P. fluorescens biotypes B and G and P. putida biovar B. The strains of P. fluorescens biotypes formed a polyphyletic group within the 'P. fluorescens complex'.</str>

      <str>The amounts and forms of phosphorus (P) in surface sediments of Haihe River, Tianjin, North China, were examined using a sequential chemical extraction procedure. Five fractions of sedimentary P, including loosely sorbed P (NH4Cl-P), redox-sensitive P (BD-P), metal oxide bound P (NaOH-P), calcium bound P (HCl-P), and residual P (Res-P) (organic and refractory P), were separately quantified. The results indicated that the contents of different P fractions in the sediments varied greatly. The total P (TP) contents ranged from 968 to 2017 mg/kg. Phosphorus contents in NH4Cl-P, BD-P, NaOH-P, and HCl-P ranged from 6.7 to 26.6 mg/kg, 54.5 to 90.2 mg/kg, 185.2 to 382.5 mg/kg, and 252.3 to 425.5 mg/kg, respectively, which represented 1.2%-3.2%, 7.7%-13%, 33.3%-48.9%, and 36.2%-54.2% of the sedimentary inorganic P, respectively. For all the sediment samples, the rank order of P-fractions was Res-P &gt; HCl-P &gt; NaOH-P &gt; BD-P &gt; NH4Cl-P. The highly positive relationship between the amounts of P released from the sediments and those in the NH4Cl-P and BD-P fractions, indicated that NH4Cl-P and BD-P were the main fractions that can release P easily.</str>

On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from four loci, P. menonorum occurs in a clade with P. pimiteouiense, P. vinaceum, P. guttulosum, P. rubidurum, and P. parvum. Genealogical concordance analysis was applied to P. pimiteouiense and P. parvum, substantiating the phenotypically defined species. The species P. rubidurum, P. guttulosum, and P. menonorum were on distinct branches statistically excluded from inclusion in other species and have distinct phenotypes.</str>

      <str>In order to learn the phosphorus (P) species distribution in sediments of Lake Nansihu, 0-25 cm sediments from Weishanhu district in Lake Nansihu were analyzed with a sequential extraction method. The results show that: the average values of Ex-P, Al-P, Fe-P, Oc-P, Ca-P, De-P, Org-P in Weishanhu district sediments are 5.62 mg/kg, 4.08 mg/kg, 12.25 mg/kg, 13.34 mg/kg, 116.67 mg/kg, 232.36 mg/kg and 396.79 mg/kg respectively, and the rank order of P-fractionation for Lake Nansihu is Al-P &lt; Ex-P &lt; Fe-P &lt; Oc-P &lt; Ca-P &lt; De-P &lt; Org-P. The vertical phosphorous species distribution exhibits the obvious rule that exchangeable P (Ex-P), Fe-bound P (Fe-P), occluded P (Oc-P), organic P (Org-P) value decrease with depth, while the values of Al-bound P (Al-P), authigenic calcium bound P (A Ca-P), detrital apatite P (De-P) increase. The Sum1 content (the sum of Ex-P, Al-P and Fe-P) in surficial sediments is remarkably positively correlated with the PO4(3-) concentration of overlaying water, to which Fe-P content contributes the most with the correlation index 0.72. In spatial phosphorous species distribution, the discrepancy of potential active species(Ex-P, Al-P and Fe-P) is greater than those inert ones (Oc-P, Ca-P and De-P), and Org-P is only second to those potential active species.</str>

When adjusted for amount of DDT consumed, total DDT (sigma DDT, the summation of all DDT metabolites and isomers) and p,p'-DDE concentrations differed significantly (P less than 0.10) in both brains and livers, whereas p,p'-DDD differed only in brains and p,p'-DDT differed only in livers. Paired comparisons between brains and livers differed significantly for sigma DDT, (P less than 0.05), p,p'-DDE (P less than 0.05) and p,p'-DDT (P less than 0.1) for both intubated and food-dosed treatment groups, whereas p,p'-DDD (P less than 0.05) differed only in the intubated group.

      <str>A sequential extraction method was utilized to analyze seven forms of P in an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland (IVFCW) containing earthworms and different substrates. The aluminum-bound P (Al-P) content was found to be lower, and the occluded P (Oc-P) content was higher in the IVFCW. The addition of earthworms into the influent chamber of IVFCW increased the exchange P (Ex-P), iron-bound P (Fe-P), calcium bound P (Ca-P), Oc-P, detritus-bound (De-P) and organic P (Org-P) content in the influent chamber, and also enhanced P content uptake by wetland plants. A significantly positive correlation between P content of above-ground wetland plants and the Ex-P, Fe-P, Oc-P and Org-P content in the rhizosphere was found (P&lt;0.05), which indicated that the Ex-P, Fe-P, Oc-P and Org-P could be bio-available P. The Ex-P, Fe-P, De-P, Oc-P and Ca-P content of the influent chamber was higher where the substrate contained a mixture of Qing sand and river sand rather than only river sand. Also the IVFCW with earthworms and both Qing sand and river sand had a higher removal efficiency of P, which was related to higher P content uptake by wetland plants and P retained in IVFCW. These findings suggest that addition of earthworms in IVFCW increases the bioavailable P content, resulting in enhanced P content uptake by wetland plants. </str>

      <str>Petasiger Dietz, 1909 is revised, and a key to and lists of the records and hosts of the 18 recognised species are presented. The recognised species are: P. exaeretus Dietz, 1909, P. australis Johnston &amp; Angel, 1941, P. combesi Zamparo, Overstreet &amp; Brooks, 2005, P. floridus Premvati, 1968, P. grandivesicularis Ishii, 1935, P. islandicus Kostadinova &amp; Skirnisson, 2007, P. johnstoni n. sp., P. megacanthus (Kotlán, 1922), P. minutissimus Gogate, 1934, P. neocomense Fuhrmann, 1927, P. nitidus Linton, 1928, P. novemdecim Lutz, 1928, P. oschmarini Kostadinova &amp; Gibson, 1998, P. phalacrocoracis (Yamaguti, 1939), P. pseudoneocomense Bravo-Hollis, 1969, P. pungens (Linstow, 1894), P. soochowensis Ku, Chiu, Li &amp; Zhu, 1977 and P. variospinosus (Odhner, 1910). Seven of these species are redescribed on the basis of type and newly collected material. P. laricola Ku, Chiu, Li &amp; Zhu, 1977, Echinochasmus fotedari Chishti &amp; Mir, 1989 and P. neocomense of Canković, Kazić &amp; Milka (1983) are considered synonyms of P. pungens; P. longicirratus Ku, 1938, P. skrjabini Bashkirova, 1941 and P. nitidus of Chen et al. (1985) synonyms of P. neocomense; P. caribbensis Nassi, 1980 a synonym of P. novemdecim; and P. tientsinensis Ku, Chiu, Li &amp; Zhu, 1977 a synonym of P. exaeretus. P. johnstoni n. sp. is described from Tachybaptus ruficollis novaehollandiae in Australia. It is readily distinguished from the most closely-related P. grandivesicularis Ishii, 1935 and P. australis Johnston &amp; Angel, 1941 by the smaller size of the body and angle collar spines and differences in most other metrical characters. Species attributed to Petasiger which are here considered species inquirendae are: P. antigonus Nigam, 1944 sp. inq., P. chandleri Abdel-Malek, 1952 sp. inq., P. jubilarum Elperina in Skrjabin, Petrov &amp; Bashkirova, 1947 sp. inq., P. nicolli Pande, 1939 sp. inq. and P. spasskyi Oshmarin in Skrjabin, Petrov &amp; Bashkirova, 1947 sp. inq.; and Echinoparyphium inopinatum (Baer, 1959) n. comb. is a species previously attributed to Petasiger.</str>

      <str>To determine the normal values of P wave duration and P dispersion (Pd=maximum P wave duration-minimum P wave duration) in healthy children, electrocardiograms of 232 healthy children (143 boys, 89 girls, aged 7 to 15 years) were examined. There was no significant gender difference in maximum P wave duration (103+/-9.5 msec vs 102+/-8.4 msec, p=0.23) or P dispersion (27.2+/-5.3 msec vs 26.8+/-6.2 msec, p=0.643). Maximum P wave duration (r=0.23, p&lt;0.01) and P dispersion (r=0.16, p&lt;0.01) were related to age. We conclude that age affects the P wave duration and P dispersion in healthy children, and thus, should be taken into account when maximum P wave duration and P dispersion are considered for any purpose in healthy children.</str>

      <str>Sixteen streams in middle and eastern Tennessee were surveyed for the sudden oak-death pathogen Phytophthora ramorum 2010-2012. Surveys were conducted in the spring and fall using healthy Rhododendron leaves, and a total of 354 oomycete isolates were recovered. Sequence analysis of the ITS region provisionally identified 151 Phytophthora, 200 Pythium, two Halophytophthora and one Phytopythium. These include six Phytophthora species (P. cryptogea, P. hydropathica, P. irrigata, P. gonapodyides, P. lacustris, P. polonica), members of the P. citricola species complex, five unknown Phytophthora species, 11 Pythium species (P. helicoides, P. diclinum, P. litorale, P. senticosum, P. undulatum, P. vexans, P. citrinum, P. apleroticum, P. chamaihyphon, P. montanum, P. pyrilobum), three unknown Pythium species, Halophytophthora batemanensis, and one Phytopythium isolate. The biology and implications are discussed.</str>

      <str>This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with significant liver histological changes. Liver biopsies from 157 CHB patients were retrospectively analyzed. Only ALB was significantly correlated with advanced liver necroinflammatory (P = 0.001). Age, ALB, GLOB, AST, PLT, and PT were independent predictors of significant fibrosis (P = 0.002, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.048, P &lt; 0.001, and P = 0.001, resp.). AST, WBC, and HBV DNA were significantly correlated with advanced fibrosis in normal ALT patients (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.041, and P = 0.012, resp.) and age, ALB, GLOB, PLT, and PT in patients with abnormal ALT (P = 0.003, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.004, P &lt; 0.001, and P = 0.002, resp.). Age, AST, GGT, PLT, and PT were significantly associated with advanced fibrosis in HBeAg+ patients (P = 0.01, P = 0.016, P = 0.027, P = 0.016, and P = 0.009, resp.) and ALB, GLOB, WBC, PLT, and PT in HBeAg- patients (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.004, P = 0.005, P &lt; 0.001, and P = 0.035, resp.). PLT was an excellent predictor for cirrhosis (P &lt; 0.001 and AUROC = 0.805). ALT was not predictive of advanced fibrosis for patients with HBeAg+ or HBeAg- (P = 0.273 and P = 0.599, resp.). PLT was an excellent predictor for cirrhosis in CHB patients. Liver histopathology can be recommended for chronic HBV carriers of older age, with normal ALT, lower PLT, and lower ALB. </str>

      <str>The amounts and forms of potentially mobile phosphorus (P) in surface sediments of Qarun and Wadi El-Rayan lakes were evaluated during winter and summer using a sequential chemical extraction. Five sedimentary P fractions were separately quantified: loosely sorbed P (NH(4)Cl-P), iron-associated P (BD-P), calcium- bound P (HCl-P), metal oxide bound P (NaOH-P), and residual P (organic and refractory P). The results indicated that the fractional composition of the examined lakes was different while the total P concentrations were approached. The inorganic P in the surface sediment mainly consisted of Ca-P followed by Fe-P in Qarun Lake, while Al-P took the second order in Wadi El-Rayan lakes. The ranks order of the different P extracts were HCl-P &gt; residual-P approximately NaOH-P &gt; NH(4)Cl-P &gt; BD-P and residual-P &gt; NH(4)Cl-P &gt; HCl-P &gt; NaOH-P &gt; BD-P for Qarun and Wadi El-Rayan lakes, respectively.</str>

The bulky P(2)P(3)(tBu) (1) and P(3)P(3)(tBu) (3) ligands are the most sterically encumbered PP(3)-type ligands so far synthesized, and in all cases, only three phosphorus donors are able to bind to the metal center. Complexes RuCl(2)(PhP(2)P(2)(tBu)) (5) and RuCl(2)(P(3)P(3)(tBu)) (6) were characterized by crystallography. Low temperature solution and solid state (31)P{(1)H} NMR were used to demonstrate that the structure of RuCl(2)(P(2)P(3)(tBu)) (4) is probably analogous to that of RuCl(2)(PhP(2)P(2)(tBu)) (5) which had been structurally characterized.</str>

The existence of species complexes among those taxa was confirmed. P. membranaefaciens was a plausible ancestral species, and its closest relative in the cactophilic group was P. deserticola. These two species appeared to be moderately related to P. heedii and to P. barkeri, but the latter was shown clearly to belong to the P. kluyveri complex, in spite of a 6 mol% G+C difference in their nuclear DNAs. P. cactophila and P. pseudocactophila ostensibly emerged from P. norvegensis, a facultatively cactophilic yeast. The P. amethionina, P. cactophila and P. opuntiae species complexes appeared independent from one another and from all other species studied. P. salictaria did not appear to be related to P. amethionina.</str>

      <str>Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are persistent endocrine disruptors. OCPs cross the placenta; this prenatal exposure has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We investigated associations between prenatal exposure to OCPs and gestational age and birth weight in 600 infants born between 1960 and 1963. The primary OCP was 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT), its primary metabolite, 1,1'-dichloro-2,2'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and the contaminant, 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-ethane (o,p'-DDT). Regression analysis indicated that for each natural log unit increase in p,p'-DDT, birth weight increased by 274 g (95% CI: 122, 425) when controlling for p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDT. At a given level of p,p'-DDT exposure, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE were associated with decreased birth weight. p,p'-DDE was negatively associated with length of gestation, controlling for p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT. These findings suggest opposing associations between exposure to p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE and birth weight. We did not find evidence to support mediation by maternal thyroid hormone status nor that the association differed by sex.</str>

      <str>Studies on the dynamics of soil Olsen-P and different form inorganic P in the long-term fertilizing experiment of winter wheat-summer maize--&gt;spring maize rotation showed that the contents of Olsen-P and inorganic P were changed by the accumulation and consumption of P in soil. In P0 treatments, Olsen-P decreased gradually, and then, trended to the critical level. When fertilizing amount was basically equal to the intake by crops, the balance of Olsen-P was dynamically maintained. The contents of Olsen-P and inorganic P were enhanced, when applied P was larger than the P intake by crops. The major contents of residual inorganic P were Ca2-P and Ca8-P, both accounting for 52.3% of total inorganic P in average, and Ca8-P accounting for 78.3%. Al-P and Fe-P accounted for 26.1%, and O-P and Ca10-P accounted for 20.4% of total inorganic P. The availability of fertilizer P was obviously increased by long-term applying fertilizer P together with manure, compared with applying fertilizer P alone.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) is required to maintain healthy, high-quality, warm-season turf. However, excessive P applications to soils with poor P retention capabilities may lead to leaching losses to groundwater. This field study was conducted to determine the maximum P fertilizer application rate to (Walt.) [Kuntze] 'Floratam' St. Augustinegrass (St. Augustinegrass) and 'Empire' zoysiagrass (zoysiagrass) below which P leaching is minimized. Five P levels ranging from 0 to 5.0 g P m yr were surface applied as triple superphosphate. Turf was established on an uncoated, low-P sand with negligible P retention capacity. Leaf and root growth, tissue P concentration, soil P concentration, soil P saturation, leachate volume, and orthophosphate (P) concentration in leachates were measured. Mehlich 1-extractable soil P (M1-P) and soil P saturation ratio (PSR) increased with time as the P rate increased. Lower M1-P and PSR values were measured with St. Augustinegrass, which absorbed more P than did zoysiagrass. The root system of St. Augustinegrass was larger and deeper compared with zoysiagrass, promoting greater P uptake and less P leaching. If tissue analysis indicates that P fertilization is required and the soil has the capacity to retain additional P, application of 0.8 g P m yr to zoysiagrass and 1.07 g P m yr to St. Augustinegrass is appropriate and does not result in increased P leaching.</str>

      <str>A solid-phase microextration-based sampling method was employed to determine the concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and its metabolites, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene (DDE) and 1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene (DDMU), in two estuarine bays, Daya Bay and Hailing Bay, of South China. Six DDT components including p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDMU were detected in Hailing Bay, while only p,p'-DDD was found in Daya Bay. p,p'-DDD was the most abundant DDT component in both bays, sharply different from the previous finding in the water column of the Palos Verdes Shelf, California, USA that p,p'-DDE was prevalent. In addition, the occurrence of p,p'-DDMU (with a range of 0.047-0.21 ng/L in Hailing Bay) has not been reported around the globe, and its presence in our study region appeared to stem from dehydrochlorination of p,p'-DDD, favored under aerobic conditions, but further investigations are clearly needed to confirm the mechanism for generation of DDMU in estuarine environments.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) in surface sediments of the Laizhou Bay (LB) and the coastal waters around the Zhangzi Island (ZI) was analyzed. Six forms of P were separated - exchangeable or loosely sorbed P (Ads-P), aluminum-bound P (Al-P), iron-bound P (Fe-P), authigenic apatite plus CaCO3-bound P plus biogenic apatite (Ca-P), detrital apatite plus other inorganic P (De-P) and organic P (OP). The average contents of P in the LB were in the order: De-P&gt;OP&gt;Ca-P&gt;Fe-P&gt;Ads-P&gt;Al-P; in the ZI, the corresponding order was De-P&gt;OP&gt;Fe-P&gt;Ca-P&gt;Ads-P&gt;Al-P. Due to the high nutrient loadings from the surrounding rivers, TP contents in sediments of the LB were higher than in those of the ZI. The potential bio-available P (Ads-P and OP) accounted for 14.7% and 24.2% of TP in sediments of the LB and the ZI, respectively. </str>

(Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2007, 9, 92-103)--from pixel-by-pixel fittings of the spin-echo modulation for the 2D correlation peaks due to linked phosphate tetrahedra (P(1)-P(1), P(1)-P(2), P(2)-P(1), and P(2)-P(2)) in a (31)P refocused INADEQUATE solid-state MAS NMR spectrum of a cadmium phosphate glass, 0.575CdO-0.425P(2)O(5). In particular, separate variations for each 2D (31)P REINE peak are obtained which reveal correlations between the J couplings and the (31)P chemical shifts of the coupled nuclei that are much clearer than those evident in previously presented 2D z-filtered (31)P spin-echo spectra. Notably, such correlations between the J couplings and the (31)P chemical shifts are observed even though the conditional probability distributions extracted using the protocol of Cadars et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 4466-4476) indicate that there is no marked correlation between the (31)P chemical shifts of neighboring phosphate tetrahedra. For 2D peaks at the P(2) (31)P chemical shift in the direct dimension, there can be contributions from chains of three units (P(1)-P(2)-P(1)), chains of four units (P(1)-P(2)-P(2)-P(1)), or longer chains or rings (-P(2)-P(2)-P(2)-): for the representative glass considered here, best fits are obtained assuming a glass comprised predominantly of chains of four units. The following variations are found: (2)J(P(1),P(1)) = 13.4 +/- 0.3 to 14.8 +/- 0.5 Hz, (2)J(P(1),P(2)) = 15.0 +/- 0.3 to 18.2 +/- 0.3 Hz, and (2)J(P(2),P(2)) = 5.9 +/- 0.6 to 9.1 +/- 0.9 Hz from the fits to the P(1)-P(1), P(1)-P(2), and P(2)-P(2) peaks, respectively. The correlation of a particular J coupling with the (31)P chemical shifts of the considered nucleus and the coupled nucleus is quantified by the coefficients C(F(2)) and C(F(1)) that correspond to the average pixel-by-pixel change in the J coupling with respect to the chemical shift of the observed (F(2)) and neighboring (F(1)) (31)P nuclei, respectively.</str>

      <str>The previous studies relating to the effect of the Valsalva maneuver on P wave do not provide detailed information. In those studies, the parameters related to P wave duration during the release phase of the Valsalva maneuver were evaluated. The authors evaluated P wave amplitude as well as P wave duration during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver. Thirty-seven normal subjects and 36 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) were included in the study. Twelve-lead surface electrocardiography (ECG) was obtained from all the patients before and during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver. The authors evaluated the parameters related to both P wave duration and P wave amplitude. The highest P wave voltage was expressed as the P wave amplitude maximum (P amp max), the lowest P wave voltage as the P wave amplitude minimum (P amp min), and the P wave amplitude dispersion (P amp dispersion) as "the P amp max - the P amp min." Also, the maximum P wave duration was expressed as the P maximum (P max), the minimum P wave duration as the P minimum (P min), and the P wave dispersion as "the maximum P wave duration (P max) - the minimum P wave duration (P min)." All these parameters were measured before and during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver. P max, P dispersion, P amp max, and P amp dispersion were higher in patients with PAF compared to those of normal subjects before the Valsalva maneuver. In normal subjects, P max, P wave dispersion, P amp max, and P amp dispersion values were significantly higher in the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver than before (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05, and p&lt;0.05, respectively). In the patients with PAF, P max, P wave dispersion, P amp max, and P amp dispersion values were significantly lower during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver than before. In conclusion, in the patients with PAF, P wave parameters were decreased during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, approaching to the normal levels.</str>

      <str>How plants develop adaptive strategies to efficiently use nutrients on infertile soils is an important topic in plant ecology. It has been suggested that, with decreasing phosphorus (P) availability, plants increase photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) (i.e., the ratio of instantaneous photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate per unit foliar P). However, the mechanism to increase PPUE remains unclear. In this study, we tested whether high PPUE is explained by an optimized allocation of P in cells among P-containing biochemical compounds (i.e., foliar P fractions). We investigated the relationships among mass-based photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate (A mass), PPUE, total foliar P concentration, and foliar P fractions in 10 tree species in two tropical montane rain forests with differing soil P availability (five species on sedimentary soils and five species on P-poorer ultrabasic serpentine soils) on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. We chemically fractionated foliar P into the following four fractions: metabolic P, lipid P, nucleic acid P, and residual P. A mass was positively correlated with the concentrations of total foliar P and of metabolic P across 10 tree species. Mean A mass and mean concentrations of total foliar P and of each foliar P fraction were lower on the P-poorer ultrabasic serpentine soils than on the sedimentary soils. There was a negative relationship between the proportion of metabolic P per total P and the proportion of lipid P per total P. PPUE was positively correlated with the ratio of metabolic P to lipid P. High PPUE is explained by the net effect of a relatively greater investment of P into P-containing metabolites and a relatively lesser investment into phospholipids in addition to generally reduced concentrations of all P fractions. We conclude that plants optimize the allocation of P among foliar P fractions for maintaining their productivity and growth and for reducing demand for P as their adaptation to P-poor soils. </str>

      <str>Partial sequences of four core 'housekeeping' genes (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD) of the type strains of 107 Pseudomonas species were analysed in order to obtain a comprehensive view regarding the phylogenetic relationships within the Pseudomonas genus. Gene trees allowed the discrimination of two lineages or intrageneric groups (IG), called IG P. aeruginosa and IG P. fluorescens. The first IG P. aeruginosa, was divided into three main groups, represented by the species P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri and P. oleovorans. The second IG was divided into six groups, represented by the species P. fluorescens, P. syringae, P. lutea, P. putida, P. anguilliseptica and P. straminea. The P. fluorescens group was the most complex and included nine subgroups, represented by the species P. fluorescens, P. gessardi, P. fragi, P. mandelii, P. jesseni, P. koreensis, P. corrugata, P. chlororaphis and P. asplenii. Pseudomonas rhizospherae was affiliated with the P. fluorescens IG in the phylogenetic analysis but was independent of any group. Some species were located on phylogenetic branches that were distant from defined clusters, such as those represented by the P. oryzihabitans group and the type strains P. pachastrellae, P. pertucinogena and P. luteola. Additionally, 17 strains of P. aeruginosa, 'P. entomophila', P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. syringae and P. stutzeri, for which genome sequences have been determined, have been included to compare the results obtained in the analysis of four housekeeping genes with those obtained from whole genome analyses.</str>

At 10 microM concentration many of the compounds tested inhibited this enzyme. The order of effectiveness of inhibition was as follows: p,p'-DDE greater than p,p'-DDD greater than p,p'-DDT greater than methoxychlor(mec). Both p,p'-DDOH and p,p'-DDA did not inhibit the placental Ca2+-ATPase. Assays using varying concentrations (0.3 microM to 0.1 mM) of p,p'-DDT were also performed. The inhibition of human placental Ca2+-ATPase ranged from 12% for 0.3 microM p,p'-DDT to 69% for 30 microM p,p'-DDT. Higher concentrations of this pesticide failed to cause further enzyme inhibition.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein is an efflux pump for a broad spectrum of hydrophobic agents. We found that bioactive peptides including somatostatin and substance P inhibit ATP-dependent vincristine binding to P-glycoprotein-overexpressing K562/ADM membrane vesicles. Some of these bioactive peptides including somatostatin stimulate basal ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein; in contrast, other peptides including substance P inhibit it. The K562/ADM membrane vesicles showed an ATP-dependent, osmotically sensitive uptake of somatostatin and substance P, which was inhibited by valspodar, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. These findings suggested that certain bioactive peptides such as somatostatin and substance P directly interact with human P-glycoprotein as endogenous substrates for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.</str>

      <str>The finding of appreciable quantities of p,p'-DDT after feeding o,p'-DDT to rats led to the proposal of a theory, that an isomeric metabolic conversion occurs. The presence of p,p'-DDT as an impurity in supposedly pure samples of o,p'-DDT is the correct explanation for the appearance of p,p'-DDT. Purified o,p'-DDT and (14)C-labeled o,p'-DDT yielded no data to support the idea that o,p'-DDT is converted to the p,p'-DDT isomer.</str>

      <str>Penicillium species were isolated from 1073 adult mosquitoes and larvae of Aedes spp., Anopheles spp., Culex spp. and Mansonia spp. captured in the northern and southeastern regions of Brazil. In a total of 24 collections, 198 Penicillium strains were identified in 13 species: Penicillium canescens, P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, P. corylophilum, P. decumbens, P. expansum, P. fellutanum, P. implicatum, P. janthinellum, P. oxalicum, P. purpurogenum, P. viridicatum and P. waksmanii. The total isolation frequency of the Penicillium species in the investigated mosquitoes was: Anopheles spp. (51.5%), Aedes spp. (15.1%), Culex spp. (23.7%) and Mansonia spp. (10.1%). The Penicillium species with the highest incidence in the mosquito genera were: P. corylophilum, P. janthinellum, P. fellutanum and P. waksmanii. The highest number of mosquitoes were captured in the state of Rio de Janeiro, followed by Rondônia and Minas Gerais.</str>

      <str>We report transverse momentum (p(T)≤15  GeV/c) spectra of π(±), K(±), p, p[over ¯], K(S)(0), and ρ(0) at midrapidity in p+p and Au+Au collisions at √S(NN)=200  GeV. Perturbative QCD calculations are consistent with π(±) spectra in p+p collisions but do not reproduce K and p(p[over ¯]) spectra. The observed decreasing antiparticle-to-particle ratios with increasing p(T) provide experimental evidence for varying quark and gluon jet contributions to high-p(T) hadron yields. The relative hadron abundances in Au+Au at p(T)≳8  GeV/c are measured to be similar to the p+p results, despite the expected Casimir effect for parton energy loss.</str>

      <str>Studies on the dynamics of upland field P pool under a long-term application of fertilizer P in yellow soil area and their effects on P concentration in runoff showed that the contents of A1-P, Fe-P and Ca-P in soil cultivated layer increased greatly, and Olsen-P and algae-available P also accumulated obviously. The correlation coefficients of algae-available P content in the high-P soils (Olsen-P &gt; 25 mg.kg-1) with the quantities of A1-P, Fe-P and Ca-P were 0.859**, 0.903** and 0.650*, respectively, of which, Fe-P was the most important. By a 30-min rainfall simulation experiment with a constant rainfall rate of 63.2 mm.h-1, the concentrations of dissolved reactive P and bio-available P in runoff from low-P upland fields (Olsen-P 4.62-15.9 mg.kg-1) were 2.81-4.17 micrograms.L-1 and 0.723-0.876 mg.L-1, respectively, whereas their concentrations in runoff from high-P upland fields (Olsen-P 29.4-59.2 mg.kg-1) were 0.026-0.714 mg.L-1 and 0.996-1.281 mg.L-1, respectively. Therefore, runoff from high-P upland fields could accelerate water eutrophication.</str>

      <str>The distribution characteristics of phosphorus (P) forms in the sediment profile of Lake Erhai, in southwestern China has been investigated by sequential extraction and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) of NaOH extracts to understand P dynamics and its potential contribution to lake eutrophication. Contents of P fractions varied in the order of NH4Cl extracted P (NH4Cl-P) &lt; bicarbonate-dithionite extracted P (BD-P) &lt; HCl-P, Residual-P &lt; NaOH extracted P (NaOH-P). The highly available NH4Cl-P represented less than 1% of total P (TP). BD-P and NaOH extracted reactive P (NaOH-rP) averaged 39%, while the ratio of Fe/P was higher than 15, indicating low P release from the sediments under permanent oxic condition. The less bio-available HCl-P, NaOH extracted nonreactive P (NaOH-nrP) and residual-P contributed 61% of TP. Regression analysis revealed that BD-P, NaOH-rP and HCl-P were positively correlated with the contents of Fe and Mn, Al and Fe, and Ca, respectively. The investigation of P compound groups in NaOH extracts by 31P NMR showed that ortho-P and monoester-P were the largest two constituents of the P pool, followed by diester-P, phosphonate and pyro-P. A comparison of vertical variations of P groups in the sediment profile suggested that these compounds were involved in the P recycling to different extents in Lake Erhai. In particular, the lake exhibits high potential for labile P release from the surface sediments, which should be taken into consideration even after the outsourced P runoff ceased.</str>

      <str>Cladosporium strain AJR(3)18501 was tested for its ability to sorb the organochlorine pesticide (OCP) p,p'-DDT from aqueous media. When p,p'-DDT was added to distilled water, ethanol or 1-propanol solutions in excess of its solubility, p,p'-DDT was sorbed onto the fungal biomass. Increasing the amount of p,p'-DDT in solution by changing the medium composition increased sorbent uptake: p,p'-DDT uptake by the fungal biomass was 2.5 times greater in 25% 1-propanol (17 mg of p,p'-DDT g(-1) dry weight fungal biomass) than in distilled water. When p,p'-DDT was dissolved in 25% 1-propanol (12 mg x l(-1)), rapid p,p'-DDT sorption occurred during the first 60 min of incubation. p,p'-DDT in solution was reduced to 2.5 mg x l(-1) with the remaining p,p'-DDT recovered from the fungal biomass. A number of environmental parameters were tested to determine their effect on p,p'-DDT biosorption. As arsenic (As) is prevalent at DDT-contaminated cattle dip sites, its effect on p,p'-DDT uptake was determined. The presence of As [As(III) or As(V) up to 50 mg x l(-1)] did not inhibit p,p'-DDT uptake and neither As species could be sorbed by the fungal biomass. Changing the pH of the medium from pH 3 to 10 had a small effect on p,p'-DDT sorption at low pH indicating that an ion exchange process is not the major mechanism for p,p'-DDT sorption. Other mechanisms such as Van der Waals forces, chemical binding, hydrogen bonding or ligand exchange may be involved in p,p'-DDT uptake by Cladosporium strain AJR(3)18501.</str>

      <str>To evaluate the effect of oral intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) on brain perfusion in patients with liver cirrhosis.</str>
      <str>Single photon emission computed tomography scans were performed in 43 patients with cirrhosis and in 15 age-matched healthy subjects. Twenty-nine out of forty-three patients were randomly treated with either BCAA granules or placebo, and single photon emission computed tomography was performed before and after the treatment. We measured the regional cerebral blood flow values using a three-dimensional stereotaxic region of interest template.</str>
      <str>Cirrhotic patients had regions of significant hypoperfusion in the bilateral central (right P=0.039, P&lt;0.05; left P=0.006 P&lt;0.01), parietal (right P=0.018, P&lt;0.05; left P=0.009, P&lt;0.01), angular (right P=0.039, P&lt;0.05; left P 0.008, P&lt;0.01), and left pericallosal segments (P=0.038 P&lt;0.05) as compared with healthy subjects. A significant increase in cerebral perfusion was observed 70 min after the oral intake of BCAA in the angular (right P=0.012, P&lt;0.05; left P=0.049, P&lt;0.05), temporal (right P=0.012, P&lt;0.05; left P=0.038, P&lt;0.05), pericallosal segments (right P=0.025, P&lt;0.05; left P=0.049, P&lt;0.05) and left precentral (P=0.044, P&lt;0.05), parietal (P=0.040, P&lt;0.05) and thalamus (P=0.033, P&lt;0.05).

      <str>A total of nine forms of cytochrome P-450 were purified to homogeneity from liver microsomes of male Wistar rats. They were P-451 I and P-451 II from untreated rats, P-450 II and P-450 III from phenobarbital-treated rats, MC-P-448 L and MC-P-448 H from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats, and P-452, P-448 L, and P-448 H from 3,4,5,3',4'-pentachlorobiphenyl-treated rats. Among them, MC-P-448 L and MC-P-448 H were indistinguishable from P-448 L and P-448 H, respectively, with regard to electrophoretic, spectral, catalytic and immunochemical properties, and thus seven forms were distinct hemoproteins. The minimal molecular weight of each form was as follows: P-451 I (49,000), P-451 II (52,000), P-450 II (52,000), P-450 III (53,500), P-452 (48,000), P-448 L (56,000), P-448 H (54,000). Judging from the oxidized absolute spectra, P-448 H was a high-spin form and the others were of low-spin type. In a reconstituted system, N-demethylations of benzphetamine and aminopyrine were catalyzed by most of the forms at comparable rates. On the other hand, the activities for the oxidations of benzo[a]pyrene, 7-ethoxycoumarin, biphenyl, and estradiol-17 beta varied greatly among the forms of cytochrome P-450. The most efficient catalysts were as follows: P-448 L and P-451 II for benzo[a]pyrene 3-hydroxylation; P-448 L for 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation; P-448 L, P-451 II, and P-448 H for biphenyl 4-hydroxylation; P-448 L and P-448 H for biphenyl 2-hydroxylation; and P-451 II and P-448 H for estradiol 2-hydroxylation. P-451 I, P-450 II, and P-450 III were somewhat poorer catalysts in metabolizing all the substrates except for benzphetamine and aminopyrine, but their substrate specificities were still distinguishable from one another. Of all the purified cytochrome P-450's, P-452 showed the least ability to metabolize all the substrates. Judging from the properties, it appears that six forms in male Wistar rats correspond to the distinct forms of cytochrome P-450 in Long-Evans and/or Sprague-Dawley rats reported by other workers, but P-451 I is a new constitutive isozyme in Wistar rats.</str>

      <str>Morphological and morphometric studies were conducted on the populations and paratypes of 14 species of the genus Pratylenchoides, including P. alkani, P. acuticauda, P. arenarius, P. arenicola, P. bacilisemenus, P. crenicauda, P. erzurumensis, P. heathi, P. laticauda, P. ritteri, P. rivalis, P. sheri, P. utahensis and P. variabilis. In addition, P. erzurumensis was redescribed based on a bisexual population from western Iran. The conoid head of males is an additional diagnostic character of this species distinguishing it from the closely related P. laticauda and P. camachoi. Based on detailed study of the main characters, synonymies of P. arenarius with P. bacilisemenus and P. variabilis with P. crenicauda are proposed. Synonymy of P. alkani with P. ritteri is supported also by morphological and biological evidence. Some taxonomic notes are made on some other species of the genus. Finally, a diagnostic compendium and key is provided for species identification.  </str>

      <str>This study provides information on the current status of contamination by DDT in agricultural soils in south-western Spain. A recent use of technical DDT in at least 17% of the soils was found based on the values (&lt;1) of the ratio R(p,)(p')/(p,)(p') = [p, p'-DDE + p, p'-DDD]/[p, p'-DDT]. According to the ratio R₀,(p')/(p,)(p') = [o, p'-DDT]/[p, p'-DDT] , a dicofol type contamination was detected in about 27% of the soils. A wide range of concentrations was observed (0.08-11.1 ng/g d.w.) regardless of the type of crop soil. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs), based on the chiral analysis of o,p'-DDT residues differed from the racemic value (0.500) in most soils but they were not correlated with the study variables [DDTs], SOM, R(p,)(p')/(p,)(p') and R₀,(p')/(p,)(p'). Given the health risks posed by DDT, our findings support how the environmental control of legacy pollutants such as DDT cannot be neglected.</str>

      <str>Restriction fragment analysis was conducted to determine interspecific chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation and genetic relationships among Populus deltoides, P. nigra, P. x canadensis (P. deltoides x P. nigra), and P. maximowiczii. Total cellular DNAs of these poplars were digested with 16 restriction endonucleases, and Southern blots of the restriction digests were probed with six different cloned cpDNA fragments from Petunia. P. deltoides, P. nigra, and P. maximowiczii each had a distinct chloroplast genome, separated by many restriction-site and restriction-fragment-length mutations, predominantly in the large single-copy region of the genome. P. x canadensis shared the same cpDNA restriction fragment patterns as P. deltoides var. deltoides. P. nigra was most diverged from P. deltoides, and P. deltoides showed close cpDNA relationships to P. maximowiczii. Nucleotide substitutions per site in cpDNA were 0.0036 between P. deltoides and P. maximowiczii, 0.0071 between P. nigra and P. maximowiczii, and 0.0077 between P. deltoides and P. nigra. We suggest that P. nigra should be classified in a new separate section, the Nigrae. </str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) in wetlands is mainly bound to sediment in various species, which is essential to predict water column P levels. The purpose of this work is to understand the influences of sediment properties and vegetation types on P speciation. Sediments under four vegetation types in the tidal flat and offshore sandbar in Hangzhou Bay of China were collected seasonally. The rank order of P species in sediment based on concentration was exchangeable P (Exch-P) &lt; iron/aluminum-bound P (Fe/Al-P) &lt; organic P (Org-P) &lt; calcium-bound P (Ca-P). Sediment total phosphorus (TP) and Fe/Al-P concentrations were lower in offshore sandbar than those of tidal flat, reflecting effects of anthropogenic contamination in the latter. Sediment particle size distribution strongly affected P speciation, as indicated by a significant correlation between them. Total phosphorus and Org-P concentrations in vegetated sediments were higher than those of bare mudflat. Additionally, there was a significant negative correlation between Ca-P and Org-P, and Fe/Al-P, indicating the presence of vegetation which may result in P speciation by converting Ca-P to soluble and active P and higher Org-P. Overall, sediment particle size distribution is the most fundamental physical property that affects P speciation, and vegetation types are important factors that influence Org-P concentration.</str>

      <str>The most viable way to beneficially use animal manure on most farms is land application. Over the past few decades, repeated manure application has shown adverse effects on environmental quality due to phosphorus (P) runoff with rainwater, leading to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. Improved understanding of manure P chemistry may reduce this risk. In this research, 42 manure samples from seven animal species (beef and dairy cattle, swine, chicken, turkey, dairy goat, horse, and sheep) were sequentially fractionated with water, NaHCO₃, NaOH, and HCl. Inorganic (P(i)), organic (P(o)), enzymatic hydrolyzable (P(e); monoester-, DNA-, and phytate-like P), and nonhydrolyzable P were measured in each fraction. Total dry ash P (P(t)) was measured in all manures. Total fractionated P (P(ft)) and total P(i) (P(it)) showed a strong linear relationship with P(t). However, the ratios between P(ft)/P(t) and P(it)/P(t) varied from 59 to 117% and from 28 to 96%, respectively. Water and NaHCO₃ extracted most of the P(i) in manure from ruminant+horse, whereas in nonruminant species a large fraction of manure P was extracted in the HCl fraction. Manure P(e) summed over all fractions (P(et)) accounted for 41 to 69% of total P(0) and 4 to 29% of P(t). The hydrolyzable pool in the majority of the manures was dominated by phytate- and DNA-like P in water, monoester- and DNA-like P in NaHCO₃, and monoester- and phytate-like P in NaOH and HCl fractions. In conclusion, if one assumes that the P(et) and P(it) from the fractionation can become bioavailable, then from 34 to 100% of P(t) in animal manure would be bioavailable. This suggests the need for frequent monitoring of manure P for better manure management practices.</str>

      <str>The phosphorus (P) distribution in the sediments of Haizi Lake from the middle reach of the Yangtze River region, China, was investigated using a sequential chemical extraction procedure. P forms and concentrations of sediment samples taken at 25 sites over the whole lake were measured. The relationships between various forms of P in sediments and dissolved P in the overlying water were also discussed. Results showed that the concentrations of total P (TP) in the sediments ranged from 404 to 670 mg kg⁻¹, with an average of 503 mg kg⁻¹. The exchangeable P (Ex-P), Al-bound P (Al-P), Fe-bound P (Fe-P), occluded P (Oc-P), authigenic carbonate fluorapatite + biogenic apatite + CaCO₃-associated P (ACa-P), detrital apatite + other inorganic P (De-P) and organic P (Or-P) accounted for, on average, 0.52, 0.04, 10.9, 32.0, 7.4, 20.1 and 29.0% of TP, respectively. Relevance analysis indicated that Oc-P, ACa-P and De-P, as the majority forms of inorganic P, were less correlated to others. The significant correlations between Ex-P, Al-P, Fe-P, Or-P and TP suggested the probability of reciprocal transformation. It was suggested that Ex-P, Al-P, Fe-P, Or-P and TP in the sediments might be released easily to the water interface, resulting in sustained lake eutrophication.</str>

      <str>Although some species groups have been recognized in the leiuperine genus Physalaemus, no phylogenetic analysis has previously been performed. Here, we provide a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from 41 of the 46 species of Physalaemus. We employed the parsimony criterion using the software TNT and POY and the Bayesian criterion using the software MrBayes. Two major clades were recovered inside the monophyletic Physalaemus: (i) the highly supported Physalaemus signifer Clade, which included P. nattereri and the species previously placed in the P. deimaticus and P. signifer Groups; and (ii) the Physalaemus cuvieri Clade, which included the remaining species of Physalaemus. Five species groups were recognized in the P. cuvieri Clade: the P. biligonigerus Group, the P. cuvieri Group, the P. henselii Group, the P. gracilis Group and the P. olfersii Group. The P. gracilis Species Group was the same as that previously proposed by Nascimento et al. (2005). The P. henselii Group includes P. fernandezae and P. henselii, and was the sister group of a clade that comprised the remaining species of the P. cuvieri Clade. The P. olfersii Group included P. olfersii, P. soaresi, P. maximus, P. feioi and P. lateristriga. The P. biligonigerus Species Group was composed of P. biligonigerus, P. marmoratus, P. santafecinus and P. riograndensis. The P. cuvieri Group inferred here differed from that recognized by Nascimento et al. (2005) only by the inclusion of P. albifrons and the exclusion of P. cicada. The paraphyly of P. cuvieri with respect to P. ephippifer was inferred in all the analyses. Distinct genetic lineages were recognized among individuals currently identified as P. cuvieri and they were congruent with cytogenetic differences reported previously, supporting the hypothesis of occurrence of formally unnamed species. </str>

      <str>Based on a fifteen years field experiment in double rice-cropping region of subtropical China, the responses of microbial biomass P (MB-P) to organic C and P in red paddy soils under different fertilization systems were investigated. The results indicated that a long-term input of organic carbon sources and the increasing soil organic carbon made soil microbial biomass remain at a high level (MB-C &gt; 800 mg x kg(-1)), being a main reason of the increase of MB-P. Under long-term zero chemical P fertilization, there was a significant decrease in soil total P (P &lt; 0.05), but soil organic P increased by 29.3% on average. The inorganic P forms in deficit were mainly Al-P, Fe-P, Ca-P and O-P, with the lowest content of Al-P (only 0.5 mg x kg(-1) on average). The content of soil MB-P under zero chemical P fertilization was much higher than that of Olsen-P. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant relationship (P &lt; 0.05) between MB-P and Al-P, from which, it was deduced that the utilization of Al-P, Fe-P, Ca-P and O-P by soil microbes could be the key approach of promoting these P forms transformed into available P. Chemical P fertilization combined with organic nutrient recycling could not only enlarge the soil P pool, but also improve the P availability.</str>

      <str>Information on P release potential in relation to labile P and P fractions in sandy soils is limited. In this study, P release potential was determined by leaching, and labile P, soil P fractionation, and P adsorption capacity were measured in the laboratory using 96 Florida sandy soil samples to evaluate the relationship between P release in water and soil P status. The sandy soils had a very low P adsorption capacity. The adsorption maximum, as calculated from the Langmuir equation, averaged 40.4 mg P kg(-1). More than 10% of the soil P was water soluble, indicating a high risk of P leaching from soil to water. Successive leaching using deionized water released, on average, 7.7% of total P (144.5 mg kg(-1)) in different soils, whereas labile P recovered by successive water extraction accounted for 39.2% of the total P. Variation in release potential among the different soils could be explained more by the difference in amounts of extractable P than the adsorption capacity. Total amounts of P released by successive leaching were significantly correlated with all labile P indices measured by different methods and all soil P fractions except for residual P. The correlation coefficients (r) were 0.97** for water-soluble P, 0.96** for 0.01 M CaCl2-P, 0.94** for Olsen P, 0.86** for Mehlich 1-P, 0.77*** for Mehlich 3-P, and 0.64*** for Bray 1-P. There were no obvious turning points in the relationships between Olsen-P, water-soluble P, or CaCl2-P and the amounts of P released from the sandy soils. The release of P from the sandy soils appeared to be controlled by a precipitation-dissolution reaction rather than a P sorption-desorption process. Furthermore, the sequential extraction of soils using deionized water indicated that P released was not limited to the labile P (H2O-P, NaHCO3-IP) and potentially labile P (NaOH-P) pools, but also from the HCl-P, indicating that all of P fractions except for residual P in the sandy soils can contribute to P release.</str>

      <str>Although the production and use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a legacy component of persistent organic pollutants, have been highly restricted worldwide, the environmental fate of DDT has remained a great concern as it is not only ubiquitous and bioaccumulative but can also be degraded to a series of metabolites that may be more hazardous ecologically. The present study, taking advantage of the abundant levels of DDT and its metabolites in a subtropical coastal region of China, investigated into the degradation pathways of DDT in natural coastal sediment. Sediment profiles indicated that degradation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT) to 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD) mainly occurred in sediment of the top 20 cm layer. 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), aerobically transformed from p,p'-DDT prior to sedimentation, was likely to degrade to 1-chloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDMU) which was further converted to 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDNU). In addition, p,p'-DDNU could be transformed to 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDNS) and other high-order metabolites. On the other hand, the conversions of p,p'-DDD to p,p'-DDMU and 1-chloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDMS) to p,p'-DDNU were deemed slow in anaerobic sediment. Therefore, the present study confirmed all the degradation pathways involving reductive dechlorination and p,p'-DDE being a more important precursor for p,p'-DDMU than p,p'-DDD in anaerobic sediment, as proposed previously. On the other hand, the present study suggested that p,p'-DDMU instead of p,p'-DDMS was more likely the precursor for formation of high-order metabolites. Based on the current assessments, use of (DDD+DDE)/DDTs to indicate whether there is fresh DDT input may lead to large uncertainties if the concentrations of high-order metabolites are not negligible. Similarly, ecological risk assessment associated with DDT should be conducted with consideration of high-order DDT metabolites.</str>

      <str>We present a retrospective analysis of surgical outcome of sinonasal malignant tumors. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), local control (LC), and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated in 32 patients. Prognostic factors for survival and functional outcomes were investigated. The median follow-up period was 70 months. At 5 years, OS, DSS, LC, and DFS rates were 0.722, 0.745, 0.851, and 0.707, respectively. Prognostic factors for poor OS were involvement of the frontal sinus (p = 0.023), T classification (T4, p = 0.025), surgical complications (p = 0.029), chemotherapy (p = 0.035) postsurgical infection (p = 0.043), involvement of the orbit (p = 0.048), histology (squamous cell carcinoma, p = 0.049), and radiotherapy (p = 0.043). Prognostic factors for poor DSS were radiotherapy (p = 0.030), chemotherapy (p = 0.036), positive surgical margin (p = 0.034), and T classification (T4, p = 0.050). LC was adversely influenced by surgical procedure (combined frontotemporal resection, p = 0.035) and positive surgical margin (p = 0.049). DFS was adversely influenced by positive surgical margin (p = 0.001). Prognostic factors for poor functional outcome were postsurgical infection (p = 0.039), postsurgical complications (p = 0.040), tumor location (maxillary sinus, p = 0.042, orbit, p = 0.0002), number of sinuses involved (number of sinuses involved was inversely proportional to functional outcome, p = 0.027), T classification (T4 p = 0.007), pathology (squamous cell carcinoma, p = 0.023), and chemotherapy (p = 0.048).

      <str>The amounts and forms of potentially mobile P in surface sediments from two lakes, Volvi and Koronia, located in Northern Greece were evaluated using a sequential chemical extraction. Five sedimentary P reservoirs were separately quantified: loosely sorbed P (NH4Cl-P); iron associated P (BD-P); calcium bound P (HCl-P); metal oxide bound P (NaOH-P) and residual P (organic and refractory P). Samples were taken in two seasons and the average concentration of the fractions of phosphorus were calculated. The results indicated that the TP content and chemically extractable phosphorus in the sediments of Koronia Lake were higher than those of Volvi Lake. Sediment TP was also strongly and positively correlated with sediment Fe. Fine-sized sediments exhibited significantly higher concentrations for both lakes than the sand fraction. The P in the surface sediment mainly consisted of HCl-P and Res-P, while NH4Cl-P and BD-P only constituted a minor part. The rank order of the different P extracts was the same for the two lakes and was Residual-P &gt; HCl-P &gt; NaOH-P &gt; BD-P &gt; NH4Cl-P.</str>

Collections were made primarily in central Europe. Indel patterns, despite sampling less than 0.7% of the plastid genome, produced four taxa groupings that were congruent with the major divisions obtained in intensive, previously published restriction-site studies. Insertion/deletion events in the trnL intron and trnL-trnF IGS were in nearly all cases unique to a single pattern group and thus provided almost no information about relationships among these groups. Indels did, however, provide a meaningful infrageneric classification criterion for Poa. They can serve as useful tools in studying relationships within this genus.</str>

Power spectral densities (PSD) were estimated by using direct method for successive 256 intervals. PSDs were integrated at the low (PSDLF; 0.05-0.15 cycle/beat) and high (PSDHF; 0.20-0.40 cycle/beat) frequency bands. Mean interval times of P-P, R-R, R-P, and P-R intervals were 827 +/- 40, 827 +/- 40, 357 +/- 34, 170 +/- 19 msec, respectively.

      <str>Ultisols in China need phosphorus (P) fertilization to sustain crop production but are prone to P loss in runoff. Balancing P inputs and loss requires detailed information about soil P forms because P speciation influences P cycling. Analytical methods vary in the information they provide on P speciation; thus, we used sequential fractionation (SF), solution P nuclear magnetic resonance (P-NMR), and P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to investigate organic P (P) and inorganic P (P) species in Chinese Ultisols managed for different crops and with different fertilizer inputs in the first study to combine these techniques to characterize soil P. Sequential fractionation showed that moderately labile NaOH-P was the largest P pool in these soils, P varied from 20 to 47%, and residual P ranged from 9 to 31%. Deoxyribonucleic acid (1-5%) and -inositol hexakisphosphate (-IHP, 4-10%) were the major P forms from P-NMR. Orthophosphate diesters determined by NMR were significantly correlated with labile NaHCO-P in SF ( &gt; 0.981; &lt; 0.001). Soil P was shown to be predominantly associated with iron and soluble calcium (Ca) by XANES. Furthermore, XANES identified hydroxyapatite in the soil receiving the highest rates of Ca-phosphate fertilizer, which had the highest HCl-P pool by SF, and also identified IHP (7%) in the soil with the highest proportion of -IHP from P-NMR. These results strongly suggest that a combined use of SF, solution P-NMR, and P K-edge XANES spectroscopy will provide the comprehensive information about soil P species needed for effective soil P management. </str>

      <str>Prolonged P-wave duration (P-dur) and excessive P-wave dispersion (P-disp) are purported arrhythmogenic substrates for atrial fibrillation. However, the extent of involvement of inhomogeneous, sinus impulse propagation demonstrated by excessive P-disp (&gt; 40 ms) has not been evaluated in relation to increasing P-dur.</str>
      <str>We appraised our previously studied sample of 500 consecutively numbered, otherwise unselected, electrocardiograms (ECGs) of outpatients from the University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts for P-disp, P-dur and P-wave axis (P-axis). P-disp, defined as the difference of the duration between the widest and narrowest P wave, and the greatest P-dur after a 12-lead ECG search, was measured manually to the nearest 10 ms. Normal P-axis was considered 0 to + 75 degrees by manually constructing the mean frontal plane electrical P-axis from the limb leads.</str>
      <str>After excluding those with atrial arrhythmias, paced rhythms, errors in lead placement, P waves with low amplitude or overall technically poor tracing, 428 ECGs depicting sinus rhythm formed our final sample. P-dur was strongly associated with P-disp (p&lt;0.0001) but the correlation remained weak (r=0.42). However, when P-dur was divided into 10 ms increments, the prevalence of abnormal P-disp rose incrementally with P-dur, with or without consideration of the P-axis. The prevalence of abnormal P-disp doubled from 30% in those with P-dur of 100 ms to &gt; 60% in those with P-dur of 120 ms. Further, the prevalence exceeded 80% with P-dur of 130 ms and reached 100% with P-dur &gt; 160 ms.</str>

      <str>Escherichia coli strain O157 produces an O-antigen with the repeating tetrasaccharide unit alpha-D-PerNAc-alpha-l-Fuc-beta-D-Glc-alpha-D-GalNAc, preassembled on undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-P-P). These studies were conducted to determine whether the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked repeating tetrasaccharide was initiated by the formation of GalNAc-P-P-Und by WecA. When membrane fractions from E. coli strains K12, O157, and PR4019, a WecA-overexpressing strain, were incubated with UDP-[3H]GalNAc, neither the enzymatic synthesis of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und nor [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und was detected. However, when membrane fractions from strain O157 were incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, two enzymatically labeled products were observed with the chemical and chromatographic properties of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und and [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und, suggesting that strain O157 contained an epimerase capable of interconverting GlcNAc-P-P-Und and GalNAc-P-P-Und. The presence of a novel epimerase was demonstrated by showing that exogenous [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und was converted to [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und when incubated with membranes from strain O157. When strain O157 was metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcNAc, both [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und and [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und were detected. Transformation of E. coli strain 21546 with the Z3206 gene enabled these cells to synthesize GalNAc-P-P-Und in vivo and in vitro. The reversibility of the epimerase reaction was demonstrated by showing that [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und was reformed when membranes from strain O157 were incubated with exogenous [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und. The inability of Z3206 to complement the loss of the gne gene in the expression of the Campylobacter jejuni N-glycosylation system in E. coli indicated that it does not function as a UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc epimerase. Based on these results, GalNAc-P-P-Und is synthesized reversibly by a novel GlcNAc-P-P-Und epimerase after the formation of GlcNAc-P-P-Und by WecA in E. coli O157.</str>

      <str>The mouse pink-eyed dilution (p) locus is known to control the melanin content, melanosome morphology, and tyrosinase activity in melanocytes. However, it is not well known whether the p allele is involved in regulating melanocyte proliferation, differentiation, and death. The aim of this study is to investigate in detail the role of the p allele in melanocyte proliferation, differentiation, and death using a cell culture system. The epidermal cell suspensions of the neonatal dorsal skin derived from wild type mice at the p locus (black, C57BL/10JHir-P/P) and their congenic mutant (pink-eyed dilution, C57BL/10JHir-p/p) were cultured with serum-free melanoblast-proliferation medium (MDMDF) and melanocyte-proliferation medium (MDMD). The proliferation and differentiation of p/p melanoblasts in MDMDF or MDMD were greatly inhibited compared with those of P/P melanoblasts and melanocytes. It is possible that apoptosis is related to the reduced proliferative and differentiative activity of p/p melanoblasts/melanocytes. The addition of apoptosis-inhibitors, such as caspase-9 inhibitor (C9I) and Bax-inhibiting peptide (BIP) into MDMDF or MDMD stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of p/p melanoblasts. In contrast, in P/P melanoblasts and melanocytes, C9I and BIP failed to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation. The number of apoptotic keratinocytes and melanoblasts/melanocytes in p/p mice was greater than in P/P mice. Moreover, expression of C9 and Bax in keratinocytes and melanoblasts/melanocytes in p/p mice was greater than in P/P mice. These results suggest that the increased apoptosis in keratinocytes and melanoblasts/melanocytes is related to the reduced proliferative and differentiative activity of p/p melanoblasts.</str>

A P metabolism model with four pools was developed to compute P exchanges in the system. The results showed that P absorption, bone resorption, and excretion of urinary P and endogenous and fecal P all play a part in the homeostatic control of P. Endogenous fecal output was positively correlated to P intake (P &lt; .01). Bone resorption of P was not influenced by intake of P, and P recycling from tissues to the blood pool was lesser for low P intake. Endogenous P loss occurred even in animals fed an inadequate P diet, resulting in a negative P balance. The extrapolated minimum endogenous loss in feces was .067 g of P/d. The minimum P intake for maintenance in Saanen goats was calculated to be .61 g of P/d or .055 g of P/(kg(.75) x d) at 25 kg BW. Model outputs indicate greater P flow from the blood pool to the gut and vice versa as P intake increased. Intake of P did not significantly affect P flow from bone and soft tissue to blood. The kinetic model and regressions could be used to estimate P requirement and the fate of P in goats and could also be extrapolated to both sheep and cattle.</str>

      <str>Cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, P-450h, and P-450i are four hepatic microsomal hemoproteins that have been purified from adult rats. Whereas cytochromes P-450g and P-450h appear to be male-specific hemoproteins, cytochrome P-450i is apparently a female-specific enzyme purified from untreated adult female rats. Cytochrome P-450f has been purified from adult male and female rats with equivalent recoveries. Amino-terminal sequence analyses of the first 15-20 amino acid residues of each of these cytochromes P-450 has been accomplished in the current investigation. Each protein possesses a hydrophobic leader sequence consisting of 65-87% hydrophobic amino acids, and only one charged amino acid (Asp) in the amino-terminal region. Although differences in the amino-terminal sequences of cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, P-450h, and P-450i are identified, these hemoproteins all begin with Met-Asp, and marked structural homology is observed among certain of these enzymes. Cytochromes P-450g and P-450h, two male-specific proteins, have 11-12/15 identical residues with cytochrome P-450i, a female-specific isozyme. Cytochromes P-450f and P-450h have 16/20 identical amino-terminal residues. Only limited sequence homology is observed between the amino-terminal sequences of cytochromes P-450f-i compared to rat liver cytochromes P-450a-e. The results demonstrate that cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, P-450h, and P-450i are isozymic to each other and five additional rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 isozymes (P-450a-e).</str>

      <str>Casein kinase-2 (CK-2) is a ubiquitous Ser/Thr specific protein kinase that recognizes phosphorylatable residues located upstream of acidic determinants, its consensus sequence being Ser(Thr)-Xaa-Xaa-Acidic. Here we show that the phosphotetrapeptide AcSer(P)-Ser(P)-Ser-Ser(P), which is devoid of the canonical consensus sequence, is nevertheless phosphorylated by CK-2 with rates comparable to that of typical peptide substrates Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu and Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu routinely employed for assaying CK-2 activity. The phosphopeptide AcSer(P)-Ser-Ser(P) [but not Ac-Ser-Ser(P)-Ser(P) or AcSer(P)-Ser(P)-Ser] is also phosphorylated albeit less efficiently than AcSer(P)-Ser(P)-Ser-Ser(P). Further N-terminal elongation with additional phosphoseryl residues to give the peptides AcSer(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser-Ser(P) and AcSer(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser-Ser(P) does not improve but rather slightly decreases the phosphorylation efficiency by CK-2. These two peptides are conversely excellent substrates for CK-1, which does not appreciably phosphorylate either AcSer(P)-Ser-Ser(P) or AcSer-(P)-Ser(P)-Ser-Ser(P). Either individual or multiple replacement of the phosphorylated residues with glutamic acid in the peptide AcSer(P)-Ser(P)-Ser-Ser(P) drastically reduces the phosphorylation efficiency by CK-2, the phosphoseryl residue at position -2 playing an especially crucial role which cannot be surrogated by glutamyl residues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

The object of this study is to identify the associated signal pathways in human HCC tissues. The expressions of OPN, intergrin aV, CD44v6, P-FAK, FAK, P-Src, Src, P-ERK and P-AKT were assayed using TMA analysis. The relationship of OPN with P-ERK, P-Src and P-AKT were explored and the role in HCC metastasis was analysed. The expression levels of OPN, intergrin aV, CD44v6, P-FAK, P-Src, Src, P-ERK and P-AKT in HCC tissue were significantly higher than that in normal tissue (P value is less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between the expression levels of FAK in HCC tissue and normal tissue (P value is more than 0.05). OPN expression was significantly associated with Integrin av (P value is less than 0.01), CD44V6 (P value is less than 0.01) and P-ERK (P value is less than 0.05) but not with P-Src, P-FAK and P-AKT (P value is more than 0.05). The expressions of P-FAK (P value is less than 0.05), P-Src (P value is less than 0.01) and P-AKT (P value is less than 0.05) were significantly associated with Integrin av and the P-FAK expression was also significantly associated with CD44V6 (P value is less than 0.01).

      <str>The C3 -symmetric propeller-chiral compounds (P,P,P)-1 and (M,M,M)-1 with planar π-cores perpendicular to the C3 -axis were synthesized in optically pure states. (P,P,P)-1 possesses two distinguishable propeller-chiral π-faces with rims of different heights named the (P/L)-face and (P/H)-face. Each face is configurationally stable because of the rigid structure of the helicenes contained in the π-core. (P,P,P)-1 formed dimeric aggregates in organic solutions as indicated by the results of (1) H NMR, CD, and UV/Vis spectroscopy and vapor pressure osmometry analyses. The (P/L)/(P/L) interactions were observed in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray analysis, and they were also predominant over the (P/H)/(P/H) and (P/L)/(P/H) interactions in solution, as indicated by the results of (1) H and 2D NMR spectroscopy analyses. The dimerization constant was obtained for a racemic mixture, which showed that the heterochiral (P,P,P)-1/(M,M,M)-1 interactions were much weaker than the homochiral (P,P,P)-1/(P,P,P)-1 interactions. The results indicated that the propeller-chiral (P/L)-face interacts with the (P/L)-face more strongly than with the (P/H)-face, (M/L)-face, and (M/H)-face. The study showed the π-face-selective aggregation and π-face chiral recognition of the configurationally stable propeller-chiral molecules.</str>

      <str>Isozyme analysis was conducted on individuals of Populus alba L., P. tremula L., and P. × canescens Smith to genetically characterize and differentiate species, hybrids, and individuals, and to determine genetic relationships among them. Thirty gene loci, with 71 alleles, coding for 15 enzymes were observed. Individuals could be identified on the basis of their multilocus genotypes. There were 21 unique multilocus genotypes among 23 P. alba clones. Five P. alba clones from Canada were genetically distinct from each other. Each of the 18 P. tremula and 15 P. × canescens clones had unique multilocus genotypes. Thirteen clones had a unique genotype at a single locus. Percentage of polymorphic loci, average number of alleles per locus, and mean observed heterozygosity were, respectively, 50.0, 1.86, and 0.085 in P. alba, 51.7, 1.66, and 0.096 in P. tremula, and 51.7, 1.86, and 0.157 in P. × canescens. Populus alba and P. tremula were genetically distinct from each other and could be distinguished by mutually exclusive alleles at Aco-3, P. tremula-specific gene Mdh-3, and allele frequency differences at 6 loci. Populus × canescens had allele contributions of P. alba and P. tremula. However, their allele frequencies were closer to those of P. alba than being truly intermediate. The mean genetic identity was 0.749 between P. alba and P. tremula, 0.987 between P. alba and P. × canescens, and 0.817 between P. tremula and P. × canescens. Canonical discriminant analysis of multilocus genotypes separated P. alba, P. tremula, and P. × canescens into three distinct groups and portrayed similar interspecific relationship as above. Our results suggested that the putative P. × canescens individuals consisted of a mixture of F1 hybrids of P. alba and P. tremula and their backcrosses to P. alba. </str>

      <str>A form of cytochrome P-450 generally catalyzing benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) hydroxylation was purified from liver microsomes of untreated rats on the basis of the catalytic activity. The purification procedures consisted of cholate solubilization and chromatography in 3 steps, on DEAE-Toyopearl (at room temperature), hydroxylapatite, and CM-Toyopearl columns. Cytochrome P-450 purified in this way (named P-450/B[a]P) was homogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the molecular weight was estimated to be 51,000. The absorption spectra of the oxidized form of P-450/B[a]P showed a Soret peak at 417 nm, characteristic of low-spin hemoprotein, and the Soret peak of the reduced cytochrome P-450-CO complex was at 451 nm. Immunochemical analysis of P-450/B[a]P indicated that P-450/B[a]P is immunologically distinct from P-450b (a major phenobarbital-inducible form of P-450) and P-450c (a major 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible form of P-450, which highly catalyzes the hydroxylation of B[a]P). B[a]P hydroxylase activity in liver microsomes of untreated rats was inhibited to about 20% by the P-450/B[a]P antibody. These results demonstrate that P-450/B[a]P is a different form of P-450 from P-450b and P-450c, and generally catalyzes B[a]P hydroxylation in liver microsomes of untreated rats.</str>

      <str>It has been demonstrated that estrogens are able to enhance lung tumorigenesis by estrogen receptor (ER) pathway. ER signaling is a highly complex process that requires a number of different coactivators, including proline-, glutamic acid- and leucine-rich protein-1 (PELP1). We studied PELP1 transcript and protein levels in cancerous and histopathologically unchanged lung tissues obtained from 73 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We observed increased levels of PELP1 transcript (P=0.00001) and protein (P=0.00001) in tumor tissues compared to adjacent histopathologically unchanged tissues. Significant increase of PELP1 transcript/protein level was found in all patients, regardless of gender (males: P=0.0003/P=0.000003; females: P=0.0005/P=0.02), age (≤ 60 patients: P=0.042/P=0.016; &gt;60 patients: P=0.00001/P=0.00001) or histopathological type of tumor (adenocarcinoma [ADC]: P=0.004/P=0.0006; squamous cell carcinoma [SSC]: P=0.0009/P=0.0008). Increased PELP1 transcript/protein levels were also correlated with some lung cancer stage (1a: P=0.07/P=0.02; 1b: P=0.001/P=0.03; 2a: P=0.012/P=0.001), tumor size (T2a: P=0.0006/P=0.001) and lymph node metastasis (N0: P=0.0003/P=0.0006; N1: P=0.017/P=0.003). Moreover, significant increase in PELP1 transcript level in cancer stage 1a (P=0.02) was observed. PELP1 protein content was higher in tumor tissues of patients with cancer stage 3a (P=0.04) and in T1a tumor size (P=0.03). Our studies demonstrate significantly higher amounts of PELP1 transcript and protein in tumor tissues in patients with NSCLC. Moreover, we also determined the association of PELP1 transcript and protein level with some clinicopathological features of NSCLC. </str>

      <str>The present study objective was to investigate ratios and correlation coefficients between dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) compounds in cord and maternal sera of mother-infant pairs from northern Thailand. The study site was located in Chiang Dao District of Chiang Mai Province which was an agricultural and former malaria endemic area. DDT compounds were analyzed in 88 cord and maternal serum samples using gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD). p,p'-DDE (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene) was the major component and detected in every cord and maternal serum samples with geometric means of 1,255 and 1,793 n g(-1) lipids, respectively. p,p'-DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) was detected at 89.8 and 100% of cord and maternal serum samples, respectively. The second and third highest levels detected were p,p'-DDD (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) and p,p'-DDT, respectively. The ratios between cord and maternal sera for p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD that were less than 1 had high correlation coefficients (ratio = 0.70, r = 0.82 for p,p'-DDE, ratio = 0.62, r = 0.66 for p,p'-DDT, and ratio = 0.79, r = 0.78 for p,p'-DDD). The high correlation coefficients indicate that cord serum levels of DDT compounds could be accurately estimated from maternal serum levels. It can be concluded that cord serum levels of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD were approximately 70%, 62%, and 79% of maternal serum levels, respectively. Furthermore, our findings can be applied in public health to monitor and evaluate risk among infants from high DDT exposure area.</str>

      <str>Fertilizer phosphorus (P) and grazing-related factors can influence runoff P concentrations from grazed pastures. To investigate these effects, we monitored the concentrations of P in surface runoff from grazed dairy pasture plots (50 x 25 m) treated with four fertilizer P rates (0, 20, 40, and 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) for 3.5 yr at Camden, New South Wales. Total P concentrations in runoff were high (0.86-11.13 mg L(-1)) even from the control plot (average 1.94 mg L(-1)). Phosphorus fertilizer significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased runoff P concentrations (average runoff P concentrations from the P(20), P(40), and P(80) treatments were 2.78, 3.32, and 5.57 mg L(-1), respectively). However, the magnitude of the effect of P fertilizer varied between runoff events (P &lt; 0.01). Further analysis revealed the combined effects on runoff P concentration of P rate, P rate x number of applications (P &lt; 0.001), P rate x time since fertilizer (P &lt; 0.001), dung P (P &lt; 0.001), time since grazing (P &lt; 0.05), and pasture biomass (P &lt; 0.001). A conceptual model of the sources of P in runoff comprising three components is proposed to explain the mobilization of P in runoff and to identify strategies to reduce runoff P concentrations. Our data suggest that the principal strategy for minimizing runoff P concentrations from grazed dairy pastures should be the maintenance of soil P at or near the agronomic optimum by the use of appropriate rates of P fertilizer.</str>

All the strains examined were separate phylogenetically from the type strain of P. membranaefaciens (type species of genus Pichia). Based on the sequence data obtained [by number of base differences (five or more) with P. anomala and base sequences on fingerprint segment] in the 18S rRNA partial base sequences, these species were divided into seven groups. Group I, including P. anomala (identical to H. anomala, type species of genus Hansenula), P. canadensis, P. muscicola, P. silvicola, P. subpelliculosa, P. americana, P. bimundalis, P. ciferrii, P. syndowiorum, P. bispora, and P. fabianii, corresponded to the genus Hansenula Sydow et Sydow. Groups II and III were comprised of P. capsulata and P. holstii, respectively.

      <str>Enhancement of p,p'-DDT photodegradation on soil surfaces using TiO2 induced by UV-light was mainly investigated in this work. After being spiked with p,p'-DDT, soil samples loaded with different doses of TiO2 (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% wt) were exposed to UV-light irradiation for 24 h. The results indicated that the photodegradation of p,p'-DDT followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics. TiO2 accelerated the photodegradation of p,p'-DDT significantly as indicated by the half-life reduction from 23.3 h to 10.4 h, corresponding to the TiO2 content from 0% to 3% respectively. In addition, the effects of soil pH, photon flux and humic substances on p,p'-DDT degradation were investigated. The photodegradation rate increased with the increase of the soil pH and photon flux. The humic substances (2% wt) inhibited the p,p'-DDT photodegradation by reducing the amount of light available to excite the p,p'-DDT and TiO2 or by quenching radicals capable of oxidizing p,p'-DDT. p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD and DDMU were main degradation intermediates and they were further degraded in the presence of TiO2.</str>

The residue levels were analysed by using a GC-ECD and confirmed by GC-MS. The DDT residues detected in fish samples from Lake Edward were p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDD. All the analysed samples of fish presented mean DDT residues ranging from non-detectable levels to 68 microg kg(-1) fresh weight. High levels of p,p'-DDT were detected in comparison to the metabolites (p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD). The detection of higher levels of p,p'-DDT than p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD, in most fish samples, suggests recent exposure of fish to DDT. Generally, most of the fish samples had residue levels below the maximum residue limits (MRL) recommended by FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.</str>

PTEN loss was correlated with male gender and smoking history and p-mTOR expression was inversely correlated with these factors (P&lt;0.001). Subgroup analysis of ADCs indicated that male gender, high pT stage, lymphovascular invasion, and PTEN loss were poor prognostic factors.

We explored the P physiology of P. polystachyus seedlings grown in nutrient solution with 0-5 mM P. In addition, young leaves and roots of soil-grown plants were used for cryo-scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis. No P-toxicity symptoms were observed, even at 5 mM P in solution. Shoot DM was similar at 0.1 and 1.0 mM P in solution, but was ∼14% lower at 2 and 5 mM P. At 1 mM P, [P] was 36, 18, 14 and 11 mg P g(-1) DM in mature leaves, young leaves, stems and roots, respectively. Leaf potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations increased with increasing P supply. Leaf epidermal and palisade mesophyll cells had similar [P]. The root epidermis and most cortical cells had senesced, even in young roots. We conclude that preferential accumulation of P in mature leaves, accumulation of balancing cations and uniform distribution of P across leaf cell types allow P. polystachyus to tolerate very high leaf [P]. </str>

In this study, soil P status and P uptake by apple trees were investigated in 5-, 10-, and 15-year-old orchards in the semi-arid Loess Plateau, China, and subset soils with different soil P statuses (14-90 Olsen-P mg kg-1) were selected to evaluate the characteristic P adsorption. Due to the low P-use efficiency (4-6%), total soil P increased from 540 mg kg-1 to 904 mg kg-1, Olsen-P ranged from 3.4 mg kg-1 to 30.7 mg kg-1, and CaCl2-P increased from less than 0.1 mg kg-1 to 0.66 mg kg-1 under continuous P fertilization. The P sorption isotherms for each apple orchard were found to fit the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.91-0.98). K (binding energy) and Qm (P sorption maximum) decreased, whereas DPS (degree of phosphorus sorption) increased with increasing P concentration. CaCl2-P increased significantly with the increase of Olsen-P, especially above the change point of 46.1 mg kg-1. Application of surplus P could result in P enrichment in P-deficient soil which has high P fixation capacity, thus posing a significant environmental risk. </str>

      <str>Two major forms of hepatic cytochrome P-450 (hepatic P-450MCI and P-450MCII) were purified approximately 5-fold from liver microsomes in Syrian golden hamsters treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC). The purified preparations of hepatic P-450MCI and P-450MCII contained 9.6 and 8.3 nmol cytochrome P-450 (P-450) per mg protein, respectively, and were essentially free from NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase (fpT), NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5. By sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the molecular weights of hepatic P-450MCI and P-450MCII were estimated to be 56,000 and 53,500. Further, a major form of pulmonary P-450 (P-450MC) were purified from lung microsomes of MC-treated hamster, and contained 14.2 nmol P-450 per mg protein, and estimated to be 56,000 in monomeric molecular weight, indicating the similar molecular weight to hepatic P-450MCI in the hamster. From the absorption spectra the oxidized forms of hepatic P-450MCI and P-450MCII were high- and low-spin ferric hemoproteins, respectively, and pulmonary P-450MC was similar to hepatic P-450MCII in their hemoprotein spin state. No difference, however, was observed in the CO-reduced forms among hepatic P-450MCI, P-450MCII and pulmonary P-450MC, all exhibiting 446.5 nm Soret bands. In a reconstituted system containing fpT and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), pulmonary P-450MC efficiently catalyzed benzo[a]pyrene (BP) hydroxylation at a rate of 11.4 mol formed per min per mol P-450, but hepatic P-450MCI and P-450MCII both exhibited lower levels, e.g., 0.49 and 0.54, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Parides burchellanus is considered a rare and threatened swallowtail species restricted to central Brazil. It shows considerable morphological similarity to Parides panthonus jaguarae, with which it shares both geographical range and larval host plant. At present, P. burchellanus and P. panthonus are believed to be distinct species, based on minor differences in male genitalia. In this study, the phylogenetic and systematic position of P. burchellanus in relation to three subspecies of P. panthonus (P. p. jaguarae, P. p. lysimachus and P. p. aglaope) was evaluated using molecular evidence: the complete sequence of the mtDNA genes COI and COII and of the nuclear gene EF-1α (c. 3300 bp). In addition, the informativeness of the 'barcode' region next to the 5' end of COI (c. 650 bp) was evaluated for delimiting these taxa. Individual analysis by neighbour-joining, using Kimura 2-parameter distance model, and by maximum parsimony showed that P. p. jaguarae + P. p. lysimachus + P. p. aglaope + P. burchellanus form a strongly supported monophyletic clade, and all molecular regions consistently recovered P. p. jaguarae and P. burchellanus as sister species. The genetic divergence among the subspecies of P. panthonus and P. burchellanus is equivalent to the divergence among conspecifics of other species of Parides, and smaller than the interspecific divergence among different sister species of this genus. The results support the proposal that P. p. jaguarae and P. burchellanus are likely to be synonymous, and suggest that P. burchellanus can be considered conspecific with P. panthonus. The taxonomic classification of P. burchellanus should be revised on the basis of the molecular data.</str>

      <str>Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), an organochlorine pesticide known to have deleterious health effects in humans, has been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rodents. A recent study has reported that p,p'-DDT and its most persistent metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), may also be associated with HCC in humans. To examine whether there is an association between p,p'-DDT and/or p,p'-DDE in a population at high-risk of developing HCC, a nested case-control study was conducted within the 83,794 person Haimen City Cohort in China. Sera and questionnaire data were collected from all participants between 1992 and 1993. This study included 473 persons who developed HCC and 492 who did not, frequency matched on sex, age and area of residence. p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE levels were determined by mass spectrometry. Hepatitis B viral infection status (based on hepatitis B virus surface antigen; HBsAg) was also determined. p,p'-DDT and/or p,p'-DDE serum levels were significantly associated with sex, area of residence, occupation, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. Adjusting for age, sex, area of residence, HBsAg, family history of HCC, history of acute hepatitis, smoking, alcohol, occupation (farmer vs. other) and levels of p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated via unconditional logistic regression. Overall, the highest quintile of p,p'-DDT was associated with an increased risk of HCC, OR = 2.96 95% CI; 1.19-7.40. There were no statistically significant associations with p,p'-DDE. Overall, these results suggest that recent exposure to p,p'-DDT may increase risk of HCC.</str>

      <str>Phytophthora isolates associated with Phytophthora major ITS Clade 6 were grouped into 11 phenotypic taxa. These comprised the described morphospecies P. gonapodyides, P. megasperma s. str. and P. humicola; four previously identified but so far undescribed taxa, informally designated here P. sp. O-group, P. sp. Apple-cherry, P. taxon Pgchlamydo, and P. taxon Walnut; and four previously unknown taxa, designated P. taxon Oaksoil, P. taxon Raspberry, P. taxon Forestsoil, and P. taxon Riversoil. With the exception of P. gonapodyides, each phenotypic taxon represented an unique ITS lineage. Two isolates morphologically identical to P. gonapodyides comprised a separate lineage and probably represent another taxon, designated here P. taxon Salixsoil, P. humicola, P. sp. O-group, P. sp. Apple-cherry and P. taxon Walnut grouped together as subclade I. Within subclade II, P. taxon Oaksoil, P. taxon Raspberry, P. taxon Forestsoil, P. taxon Riversoil and P. taxon Pgchlamydo formed a cluster of closely related but phenotypically distinct lineages basal to P. gonapodyides and P. megasperma, P. taxon Salixsoil being the most basal member. The taxonomy, adaptation and breeding systems of Clade 6 taxa are discussed. They show a strong association with forests and riparian ecosystems, only a limited association with agriculture and an ability to tolerate high temperatures. Also, in contrast to most other Phytophthora clades, Clade 6 taxa are predominantly sterile or inbreeding in culture. Only one taxon, P. sp. O-group, appears classically A1/A2 heterothallic.</str>

      <str>Soil phosphorus (P) release capability could be assessed through the degree of P saturation (DPS). Our main objective was to determine DPS and, hence, P threshold DPS values of an Ultisol treated with triple superphosphate (TSP), Gafsa phosphate rocks (GPR), or Christmas Island phosphate rocks (CIPR), plus or minus manure. P release was determined by the iron oxide-impregnated paper strip (strip P), while DPS was determined from ammonium oxalate-extractable aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), and P. Soils were sampled from a closed incubation study involving soils treated with TSP, GPR, and CIPR at 0-400 mg P kg-1, and a field study where soils were fertilized with the same P sources at 100-300 kg P ha-1 plus or minus manure. The DPS was significantly influenced by P source x P rate, P source x manure (incubated soils), and by P source x P rate x time (field-sampled soils). Incubated soil results indicated that both initial P and total strip P were related to DPS by exponential functions: initial strip P = 1.38exp0.18DPS, R2 = 0.82** and total strip P = 8.01exp0.13DPS, R2 = 0.65**. Initial strip P was linearly related to total P; total P = 2.45, initial P + 8.41, R2 = 0.85**. The threshold DPS value established was about 22% (incubated soil). Field soils had lower DPS values &lt;12% and strip P was related to initial DPS and average DPS in exponential functions: strip P = 2.6exp0.44DPS, R2 = 0.77** and strip P = 1.1DPS2 ¨C 2.4DPS + 6.2, R2 = 0.58**, respectively. The threshold values were both approximately equal to 8% and P release was 11-14 mg P kg-1. Results are evident that DPS can be used to predict P release, but the threshold values are environmentally sensitive; hence, recommendations should be based on field trials.</str>

      <str>Plasmodium ovale is comprised of two genetically distinct subspecies, P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. Although P. ovale subspecies are similar based on morphology and geographical distribution, allelic differences indicate that P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri are genetically divergent. Additionally, potential clinical and latency duration differences between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri demonstrate the need for investigation into the contribution of this neglected malaria parasite to the global malaria burden.</str>
      <str>In order to detect all P. ovale subspecies simultaneously, we developed an inclusive P. ovale-specific real-time PCR assay based on conserved regions between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in the reticulocyte binding protein 2 (rbp2) gene. Additionally, we characterized the P. ovale subspecies prevalence from 22 asymptomatic malaria infections using multilocus genotyping to discriminate P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri.</str>
      <str>Our P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay validation experiments demonstrated a linear dynamic range from 6.25 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter to 100,000 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter and a limit of detection of 1.5 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter. Specificity experiments showed the ability of the rbp2 qPCR assay to detect low-levels of P. ovale in the presence of additional malaria parasite species, including P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. We identified P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya by DNA sequencing of the tryptophan-rich antigen gene, the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and the rbp2 gene.</str>
      <str>Our novel P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay detects P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri simultaneously and can be utilized to characterize the prevalence, distribution, and burden of P. ovale in malaria endemic regions.

      <str>We have developed a PCR procedure to amplify DNA for quick identification of the economically important species from each of the six taxonomic groups in the plant pathogen genus Phytophthora. This procedure involves amplification of the 5.8S ribosomal DNA gene and internal transcribed spacers (ITS) with the ITS primers ITS 5 and ITS 4. Restriction digests of the amplified DNA products were conducted with the restriction enzymes RsaI, MspI, and HaeIII. Restriction fragment patterns were similar after digestions with RsaI for the following species: P. capsici and P. citricola; P. infestans, P. cactorum, and P. mirabilis; P. fragariae, P. cinnamomi, and P. megasperma from peach; P. palmivora, P. citrophthora, P. erythroseptica, and P. cryptogea; and P. megasperma from raspberry and P. sojae. Restriction digests with MspI separated P. capsici from P. citricola and separated P. cactorum from P. infestans and P. mirabilis. Restriction digests with HaeIII separated P. citrophthora from P. cryptogea, P. cinnamomi from P. fragariae and P. megasperma on peach, P. palmivora from P. citrophthora, and P. megasperma on raspberry from P. sojae. P. infestans and P. mirabilis digests were identical and P. cryptogea and P. erythroseptica digests were identical with all restriction enzymes tested. A unique DNA sequence from the ITS region I in P. capsici was used to develop a primer called PCAP. The PCAP primer was used in PCRs with ITS 1 and amplified only isolates of P. capsici, P. citricola, and P. citrophthora and not 13 other species in the genus. Restriction digests with MspI separated P. capsici from the other two species. PCR was superior to traditional isolation methods for detection of P. capsici in infected bell pepper tissue in field samples. The techniques described will provide a powerful tool for identification of the major species in the genus Phytophthora.</str>

      <str>While P-wave duration (P-dur) and dispersion (P-disp) could both reflect fractionated and inhomogeneous propagation of sinus cardiac impulses, and may therefore be associated with each other, a clear relationship has not been extensively studied. We studied these markers as well as the significance of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1) in relation to the P-wave axis (P-axis).</str>
      <str>We appraised our previously studied sample of 500 consecutively numbered, otherwise unselected, electrocardiograms (ECGs) of outpatients from the University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, for the foregoing P-wave characteristics. P-disp, defined as the difference of the duration between the widest and narrowest P wave, and the greatest P-dur after a 12-lead ECG search, was measured manually to the nearest 10 ms. PTFV1 was considered positive when &gt; or = 40 mm2 terminal deflection was present on biphasic P waves on lead V1. Normal P-axis was considered 0 degrees to +75 degrees by manually constructing the mean frontal plane electrical P-axis from standard limb leads.</str>
      <str>After excluding those with atrial arrhythmias, paced rhythms, errors in lead placement, P waves with low amplitude or overall technically poor tracing, 428 ECGs formed our final sample. P-dur was strongly associated with P-disp (P &lt; 0.0001), but the correlation remained weak (r = 0.42). Overall, P-dur was not significantly associated with P-axis but when divided into tertiles and quintiles, the significance was evident within the range of the normal P-axis, particularly 0 degrees to +60 degrees (P &lt; 0.0001). In a subanalysis of 380 ECGs that had appreciable biphasic P waves on lead V1, PTFV1 was noted on 178 (47%) ECGs and was significantly associated with P-dur (P &lt; 0.0001), P-disp (P &lt; 0.0001), and P-axis (P = 002). When considering P-axis in tertiles and quintiles, P-dur was greater in patients with a positive PTFV1 and significant within the normal range of the P-axis, especially from 0 degrees to +60 degrees .</str>
      <str>P-dur, P-disp, and PTFV1 appear to share a significant tripartite association in relation to the normal P-axis, particularly when P-axis ranges 0 degrees to +60 degrees . Therefore, for optimal clinical assessment, these markers should be evaluated in relation to the normal P-axis.</str>

      <str>Leopards, Panthera pardus, are widely distributed across southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The extent and phylogeographic patterns of molecular genetic diversity were addressed in a survey of 77 leopards from known geographical locales representing 13 of the 27 classical trinomial subspecies. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences (727 bp of NADH5 and control region) and 25 polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed abundant diversity that could be partitioned into a minimum of nine discrete populations, tentatively named here as revised subspecies: P. pardus pardus, P. p. nimr, P. p. saxicolor, P. p. fusca, P. p. kotiya, P. p. delacouri, P. p. japonensis, P. p. orientalis and P. p. melas. However, because of limited sampling of African populations, this may be an underestimate of modern phylogeographic population structure. Combined phylogeographic and population diversity estimates support an origin for modern leopard lineages 470,000-825,000 years ago in Africa followed by their migration into and across Asia more recently (170,000-300,000 years ago). Recent demographic reductions likely have led to genetic impoverishment in P. p. orientalis and in the island subspecies P. p. kotiya.</str>

Five restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of mtDNA differentiated P. deltoides from P. nigra, whereas three RFLPs of mtDNA separated P. deltoides from P. maximowiczii. In all cases, F1 progeny of P. deltoides x P. nigra, and P. deltoides x P. maximowiczii, crosses had mtDNA restriction fragments of only their maternal P. deltoides parents. P. x canadensis had mtDNA restriction fragments of only P. deltoides. F1 progeny of intraspecific P. deltoides crosses also had the same mtDNA fragments as their maternal parent.

      <str>Phosphorus (P) balance, and blood plasma P and saliva P concentrations were measured in multiparous dairy cows through two lactations and two dry periods. The cows were fed three amounts of P at either 100, 80 or 67% of the Dutch P recommendation, actually resulting in dietary P concentrations of 3.2 to 3.9, 2.6 to 2.9 and 2.2 to 2.6 g P/kg dry matter during lactation for the three treatments, respectively. On the basis of plasma P values as low as 0.9 mmol/l and saliva P values as low as 5.1 mmol/l during the second lactation period within the experiment, the 67% group was considered to be deficient in P. By decreasing milk production, and thus lowering P losses with milk, P retention in the 67% group remained near zero. The P supply with the 80% ration was considered to be just sufficient. At high milk yield and marginal dietary P concentrations, plasma P and saliva P concentrations were decreased. The higher P intake in high-compared with low-producing cows resulted in a constant absolute fecal P excretion, due to the fact that the apparent P digestibility was raised with increasing milk yield. There was a direct relationship between milk P output and the percentage of apparent P digestibility for individual animals.</str>

      <str>One new species of diplectanid monogenean, Pseudorhabdosynochus summanoides n. sp., is reported and described from the marine fish Epinephelus coioides off Nan'ao Shenzhen, China. P. summanoides differs from its closest relative, P. summanae (Young, 1968), by the shape of its vaginal hard-parts, which have a tightly twisted distal region and an accessory patch on the proximal curve. During the course of this work, type-material of several species of Pseudorhabdosynochus was examined and aspects of the vagina and haptor are redescribed and/or figured. These species include P. americanus (Price, 1937), P. hargisi (Oliver &amp; Paperna, 1984), P. amplidiscatus (Bravo-Hollis, 1954), P. epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938), P. riouxi (Oliver 1986), P. melanesiensis (Laird, 1958), P. cupatus (Young, 1969), P. bocquetae (Oliver &amp; Paperna, 1984), P. kritskyi Dyer et al., 1995, P. capurroi Vidal-Martinez, 1998, P. querni (Yamaguti, 1968) and P. summanae (Young, 1969).

      <str>General rules for the optimization of different biocatalytic systems in various types of media containing organic solvents are derived by combining data from the literature, and the logarithm of the partition coefficient, log P, as a quantitative measure of solvent polarity. (1) Biocatalysis in organic solvents is low in polar solvents having a log P &lt; 2, is moderate in solvents having a log P between 2 and 4, and is high in a polar solvents having a log P &gt; 4. It was found that this correlation between polarity and activity parallels the ability of organic solvents to distort the essential water layer that stabilizes the biocatalysts. (2) Further optimization of biocatalysis in organic solvents is achieved when the polarity of the microenvironment of the biocatalyst (log P(i)) and the continuous organic phase (log P(cph)) is tuned to the polarities of both the substrate (log P(s)) and the product (log P(p)) according to the following rules: |log P(i) - log P(s)| and |log P(cph) - log P(p)| should be minimal and |log P(cph) - log P(s)| and |log P(i) - log P(p)| should be maximal, with the exception that in the case of substrate inhibition log P(i), should be optimized with respect to log P(s) In addition to these simple optimization rules, the future developments of biocatalysis in organic solvents are discussed.</str>

      <str>The association of prostate cancer mortality and testicular cancer mortality with environmental exposure to the anti-androgen dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) derivative p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) in the USA was explored in the period 1971-1994 using multiple linear regression analysis. Environmental p,p'-DDE contamination by state was estimated by p,p'-DDE concentrations in the subcutaneous fat of population samples and by measurements of p,p'-DDE in tree bark. On average, African Americans had adipose p,p'-DDE levels 74% higher than Whites (8.49 vs. 4.88 microg/g; p &lt; 0.001). Neither prostate cancer mortality nor testicular cancer mortality showed a positive association with either indicator of p,p'-DDE environmental contamination. On the contrary, the regression coefficient for prostate cancer was constantly inverse for adipose p,p'-DDE along the period of study, although it approached statistical significance only for African Americans in 1981-1985 (P=-0.755; 0.10 &gt; p &gt; 0.05).

      <str>The inheritance of chloroplast (cp) DNA was examined in F1 hybrid progenies of two Populus deltoides intraspecific controlled crosses and three P. deltoides × P. nigra and two P. deltoides × P. maximowiczii interspecific controlled crosses by restriction fragment analysis. Southern blots of restriction digests of parental and progeny DNAs were hybridized to cloned cpDNA fragments of Petunia hybrida. Sixteen enzymes and five heterologous cpDNA probes were used to screen restriction fragment polymorphisms among the parents. The mode of cpDNA inheritance was demonstrated in progenies of P. deltoides × P. nigra crosses with 26 restriction fragment polymorphisms of cpDNA differentiating P. deltoides from P. nigra, as revealed by 12 enzyme-probe combinations, and in progenies of P. deltoides × P. maximowiczii crosses with 12 restriction fragment polymorphisms separating P. deltoides from P. maximowiczii, as revealed by 7 restriction enzyme-probe combinations. In all cases, F1 offspring of P. deltoides × P. nigra and P. deltoides × P. maximowiczii crosses had cpDNA restriction fragments of only their maternal P. deltoides parent. The results clearly demonstrated uniparental-maternal inheritance of the chloroplast genome in interspecific hybrids of P. deltoides with P. nigra and P. maximowiczii. Intraspecific P. deltoides hybrids also had the same cpDNA restriction fragments as their maternal parent. Maternal inheritance of the chloroplast genome in Populus is in agreement with what has been observed for most other angiosperms. </str>

      <str>Understanding legacy phosphorus (P) build-up and draw-down from long-term fertilization is essential for effective P management. Using replicated plots from Saskatchewan, Canada, with P fertilization from 1967 to 1995 followed by either P fertilization or P cessation (1995-2010), soil P was characterized in surface and subsurface layers using sequential fractionation, P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and solution (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (P NMR) spectroscopy. Legacy P from a 28-year build-up was sufficient for 15 years of wheat cultivation, resulting in no significant differences in crop yield in 2010. In surface soils, soil test (Olsen) P decreased significantly in unfertilized plots compared with 1995, which was reflected in declining aluminum (hydr)oxide-associated inorganic P by fractionation and XANES. Furthermore, XANES analysis revealed a decrease of calcium-associated P in 2010-unfertilized soils at both depths and an increase of Fe (hydr)oxides-associated P in the 2010-fertilized and -unfertilized surface soils relative to the 1995 soils. Increased total organic P and orthophosphate diesters by P NMR and accumulated inositol hexaphosphate by XANES were observed in surface soils with P fertilization cessation. In subsurface soils, few legacy P transformations were detected. These results provide important information about legacy P to improve agricultural sustainability while mitigating water quality deterioration. </str>

      <str>Podalyria calyptrata is from fynbos soils with low availability of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). We investigated the physiological basis for tolerance of low P supply in nodulated P. calyptrata and examined responses to increased supply of combined-N as Ca(NO3)2 and P. It was hypothesized that increasing supply of combined-N would stimulate P-acquisition mechanisms and enhance plant growth with high P supply. Biomass, leaf [N] and [P], organic acid and phosphatase root exudates, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity in nodules and roots were examined in two N×P experiments. Low P supply decreased leaf [P] and limited growth, decreasing the nodule:root ratio but increasing nodular PEPC and MDH activity for enhanced P-acquisition or P-utilization. At low P supply, a N-induced demand for P increased root exudation of citrate and PEPC and MDH activity in roots. Greater combined-N supply inhibited nodulation more at low P supply than at high P supply. With a P-induced demand for N the plants nodulated prolifically and increased combined-N supply did not enhance plant growth. The physiological basis for N2-fixing P. calyptrata tolerating growth at low P supply and responding to greater P supply is through balanced acquisition of P and N for plant demand. </str>

Comparison of sequences allowed us to distinguish five species, namely P. bracteatum, P. orientale, P. pseudo-orientale, P. rhoeas and P. setigerum plus P. somniferum from one another, but sequences from P. setigerum and P. somniferum were identical. It is difficult to distinguish between P. bracteatum, P. orientale and P. pseudo-orientale at the vegetative stage of growth. However, our method allowed us to distinguish between these three species and the others using nucleotide sequences and should allow identification of P. bracteatum that has been cultivated illegally in the garden in Japan. Furthermore, P. rhoeas was clearly discriminated from P. setigerum and P. somniferum by reference to the sequence of the rpl16 exon using young seedlings.</str>

      <str>Three enzyme reactions have been reported to catalyze the synthesis of phosphoribosylamine in eukaryotic cells. These activities are glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (P-Rib-P-P) amidotransferase [amidophosphoribosyl-transferase; 5-phosphoribosylamine: pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (glutamate-amidating) EC 2.4.2.14], ammonia P-Rib-P-P aminotransferase, and ammonia ribose-5-phosphate aminotransferase. A purine auxotroph derived from a cell line  of Chinese hamster fibroblasts was shown to be deficient in catalytic activities of glutamine P-Rib-P-P amidotransferase and ammonia P-Rib-P-P aminotransferase. Extracts from this cell line had normal ammonia ribose-5-phosphate aminotransferase activity. The defect in purine biosynthesis in the mutant cell line was localized to the synthesis of phosphoribosylamine. These results indicate that glutamine P-Rib-P-P amidotransferase or ammonia P-Rib-P-P aminotransferase or both are important for phosphoribosylamine synthesis, but that ammonia ribose-5-phosphate aminotransferase activity probably does not play a significant role in this eukaryotic cell line. The simultaneous disappearance of both P-Rib-P-P-dependent activities suggests these two enzyme activities are closely related structurally or genetically.</str>

Both chlorinated compounds decreased lordosis behavior, but o,p'-DDT did so only after treatment on diestrus. p,p'-DDT in contrast, decreased sexual behavior under all treatment conditions. o,p'-DDT may have altered behavior by disrupting the estrous cycle while p,p'-DDT had a major effect on the female's proceptivity and receptivity without modifying vaginal cyclicity. p,p'-DDT disrupted sexual behavior at doses as low as 25 mg/kg while 100 to 200 mg/kg o,p'-DDT were required.

Among them, the K(OA) of o,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDD and the P(L) of o,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, beta-HCH and delta-HCH were determined for the first time. The determined K(OA) and P(L) values of investigated compounds at 25 degrees C ranged from 3.14 x 10(7) (alpha-HCH) to 3.76 x 10(9) (p,p'-DDD), and 8.95 x 10(-4) Pa (p,p'-DDD) to 1.08 x 10(-1) Pa (alpha-HCH), respectively. The K(OA) and P(L) data were compared with published data. The K(OA) values of o,p'-DDT at 25 degrees C were 3.23 x 10(9), higher than o,p'-DDE (1.02 x 10(9)) and o,p'-DDD (2.01 x 10(9)), indicating o,p'-DDT were more preferred to partition in soil compared with the metabolites. The K(OA) values were lower and P(L) values were higher for o,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDD, compared with their p,p'-isomeric counterparts, leading to a potential difference in behavior and fate of these isomers. The discrepancies among chemicals are obvious, which reflected in the increasing K(OA) and decreasing P(L) values in order of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, beta-HCH, delta-HCH, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD. For each compound, the LogK(OA) decreased linearly with reciprocal absolute temperature, while LogP(L) had a significant positive correlation with the inverse absolute temperature. The present study suggested that the method of gas chromatographic retention time was appropriate to measure the K(OA) and P(L) of a number of OCPs.</str>

To confirm the inhibitory effects of p gene on the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal melanocytes, we cultured epidermal cell suspensions of neonatal skins from P/P and p/p in a serum-free medium. The proliferation and differentiation of p/p melanoblasts/melanocytes in primary culture were greatly inhibited as compared to P/P melanoblasts/melanocytes. The morphology of p/p melanoblasts/melanocytes cultured in melanocyte growth medium, though non-pigmented, was similar to P/P melanocytes; namely, dendritic, polygonal, or epithelioid. About 8% of p/p cells cultured in melanocyte growth medium were positive to the dopa reaction, and about 25% were reactive to the combined dopa-premelanin reaction. Eumelanin content in p/p was extremely reduced compared to P/P. The immunocytochemical staining of p/p melanoblasts/melanocytes revealed that they are negative to tyrosinase, but reactive to tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, TRP-2, and c-kit. However, the reactivities in p/p were lower than in P/P. Although the differentiation of p/p melanoblasts was not induced by endothelin (ET)-1, ET-2, and ET-3, the proliferation of p/p melanoblasts was stimulated by them. These results suggest for the first time that p gene exerts its influence on the proliferative activities of mouse epidermal melanoblasts by affecting the regulatory mechanisms dependent on the function of ETs.</str>

The molecular weights of P-450HFLa, b, c and d were estimated to be 51,500, 49,000, 51,500 and 50,000, respectively. Antibodies to P-450HFLa recognized P-450HFLc but not P-450HFLb or d, and antibodies to rat P-448-H (P-450IA2) cross-reacted with P-450HFLb but not with other forms of cytochrome P-450. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of P-450HFLc was highly homologous, but not identical, to that of P-450HFLa. Each form of cytochrome P-450 catalyzed mutagenic activation of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) at different rates. P-450 HFLa showed activities to produce mutagen(s) from AFB1, IQ and to a lesser extent from Glu-P-1. P-450 HFLb activated IQ at a faster rate than did the other forms.

      <str>Dam construction causes the accumulation of phosphorus in the sediments of reservoirs and increases the release rate of internal phosphorus (P) loading. This study investigated the longitudinal variability of phosphorus fractions in sediments and the relationship between the contents of phosphorus fractions and its influencing factors of the Manwan Reservoir, Lancang River, Yunnan Province, China. Five sedimentary phosphorus fractions were quantified separately: loosely bound P (ex-P); reductant soluble P (BD-P); metal oxide-bound P (NaOH-P); calcium-bound P (HCl-P), and residual-P. The results showed that the total phosphorus contents ranged from 623 to 899 µg/g and were correlated positively with iron content in the sediments of the reservoir. The rank order of P fractions in sediments of the mainstream was HCl-P&gt;NaOH-P&gt;residual-P&gt;BD-P&gt;ex-P, while it was residual-P&gt;HCl-P&gt;NaOH-P&gt;BD-P&gt;ex-P in those of the tributaries. The contents of bio-available phosphorus in the tributaries, including ex-P, BD-P and NaOH-P, were significantly lower than those in the mainstream. The contents of ex-P, BD-P, NaOH-P showed a similar increasing trend from the tail to the head of the Manwan Reservoir, which contributed to the relatively higher content of bio-available phosphorus, and represents a high bio-available phosphorus releasing risk within a distance of 10 km from Manwan Dam. Correlation and redundancy analyses showed that distance to Manwan Dam and the silt/clay fraction of sediments were related closely to the spatial variation of bio-available phosphorus. </str>

      <str>Characterizing labile P forms in animal manure is a challenge due to their susceptibility to hydrolysis. In this study, we enzymatically characterized P forms in dairy manure (no bedding), collected from a representative dairy farm in New York, by separating into soluble and residual components under mild assay conditions using water and sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). About 75% of total manure P in the fresh manure was characterized, with the remainder (25%) regarded as recalcitrant or biochemically unidentified P. The hydrolyzable organic P in soluble and residual fractions was then characterized by using phosphatase enzymes to simple monoester P, polynucleotide P, phytate-like P, and non-hydrolyzable P. Of the total P in water extracts, 77% was inorganic P, 11% hydrolyzable organic P and 12% non-hydrolyzable P. In the residual resuspension, the distribution of characterized P was 25% spontaneous labile P, 32% simple monoester P, 7% polynucleotide P, 9% phytate-like P, and 26% non-hydrolyzable P. Ultrasonication increased the P(i) release from the manure residues, but the deviation in Pi concentrations due to the sampling variance was greater that the increase in P(i) due to sonication. Autoclaving sped up the release of both spontaneously labile P and enzymatically hydrolyzable P trapped in the manure residual matrix. Quantifying labile P forms by this approach may advance our ability to predict amount of manure P that will be hydrolyzed and eventually become bioavailable. The information obtained by our modified method would be complementary to that obtained by other methods (such as P-31 NMR and sequential fractionation) for a full spectrum of P species in animal manure.</str>

      <str>In Drosophila melanogaster, transposition of the P element is under the control of a cellular state known as cytotype. The P cytotype represses P transposition whereas the M cytotype is permissive for transposition. In the long-term, the P cytotype is determined by chromosomal P elements but over a small number of generations it is maternally inherited. In order to analyse the nature of this maternal inheritance, we tested whether a maternal component can be transmitted without chromosomal P elements. We used a stable determinant of P cytotype, linked to the presence of two P elements at the tip of the X chromosome (1A site) in a genome devoid of other P elements. We measured P repression capacity using two different assays: gonadal dysgenic sterility (GD) and P-lacZ transgene repression. We show that zygotes derived from a P cytotype female (heterozygous for P (1A)/balancer devoid of P copies) and which inherit no chromosomal P elements from the mother, have, however, maternally received a P-type extra-chromosomal component: this component is insufficient to specify the P cytotype if the zygote formed does not carry chromosomal P elements but can promote P cytotype determination if regulatory P elements have been introduced paternally. We refer to this strictly extra-chromosomally inherited state as the "pre-P cytotype". In addition, we show that a zygote that has the pre-P cytotype but which has not inherited any chromosomal P elements, does not transmit the pre-P cytotype to the following generation. The nature of the molecular determinants of the pre-P cytotype is discussed.</str>

All cows were fed a common pre-partum total mixed ration (TMR) (0.28% P), followed by common TMR (0.51% P) for 7 d post-partum. On day 7, cows were randomly assigned to one of the three dietary P treatments. All treatment diets contained 16.6% CP, 15.2% ADF, 26.3% NDF, and 0.74% Ca. Total collections of milk, urine, and feces were conducted during weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 of lactation. Average body weight (591 kg), milk yield (47.9 kg/d), and DMI (25.2 kg/d) throughout the 10-wk trial were not affected by dietary P content. With increasing dietary P, however, linear increases in P intake (84.7, 135.2, and 161.5 g/d), fecal P (42.3, 87.5, and 108.6 g/d), urinary P (0.32, 1.28, and 3.90 g/d), and total P excretion (42.6, 88.8, and 112.5 g/d) were observed. Apparent P digestibility (49.0, 34.4, and 32.8% of P intake) decreased quadratically with increasing dietary P. Phosphorus balance was highly variable, but cows fed the 0.34% P diet were in negative P balance longer than were cows fed diets containing 0.51 or 0.67% P. With increasing dietary P, serum concentrations of inorganic P increased linearly, but serum Ca and Mg concentrations decreased. Increasing dietary P increased fecal and urinary P excretion in early lactation cows. Increased duration of negative P balance and changes in blood mineral concentrations suggest that cows fed low P diets mobilized more P from body reserves than cows on medium- and high-P diets.</str>

      <str>High DDT concentrations and o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratios observed in the air over Taihu Lake, a lake near Shanghai, China, led us to suggest that current use of dicofol in the area north of the lake was the main source of the measured DDTs. To examine this hypothesis, samples of commercially available formulated dicofol in China were collected in 2003 to measure the impurities of DDT related compounds (DDTs). The o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratio in the samples was 7.0, close to the observed value in the air over Taihu Lake. Average contents of o,p'-DDT, p,p'-CI-DDT, o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT in the samples were 114, 69, 44, and 17 g per kg dicofol, respectively. On the basis of a production and distribution survey, total input of DDTs to the environment from the dicofol use in China was estimated to be 8770 t between 1988 and 2002. "Dicofol type DDT pollution", defined as DDT pollution caused by dicofol use and characterized with high o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratio, might be serious in China, especially in southern and eastern China. The conversion of p,p'-CI-DDT to p,p'-DDE can lead to high p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT ratio and could mislead the evaluation of p,p'-DDT resident time in the environment.

      <str>Fractionation of soil phosphorus (P) can provide useful information for assessing the risk of soil P as the potential sources of eutrophication in aquatic systems. Little information exists on P forms in paddy soils of Isfahan Province in central Iran, where P fertilizers have been continuously applied for at least 45 years. The objectives of this study were to investigate concentrations and proportions of P forms in paddy soils and correlate the content of P forms with basic soil properties. Soil samples from three paddy sites were obtained, and soil P forms were determined by a modified Hedley fraction method. Results show that the total P concentrations ranged from 288 to 850 mg kg(-1) and were enriched in site 1. In all sites, the rank order of P fractions was HCl-P (CARB-P) &gt; residual-P (RES-P) &gt; NaOH-P (Fe-Al-P) &gt; KCl-P (EXCH-P), indicating that Ca compounds are the main soil components contributing to P retention in these calcareous paddy soils. The EXCH-P represented on average &lt; 1 % of the total P, while the Fe-Al-P ranged 3.3-18 %. The CARB-P showed considerable contribution (63.6-85.6 %) to the total P. The Pearson correlation matrix indicated that Fe-Al-P only was positively correlated with total P, but did not show any significant correlations with other soil geochemical properties. Calcium-bound P fraction was significantly correlated with the clay, silt, cation exchange capacity, and total P. </str>

      <str>The Oriental neotenic net-winged beetles attracted attention of biologists due to conspicuous large-bodied females; nevertheless phylogenetic relationships remain contentious and only a few species are known in both the fully metamorphosed males and neotenic females. The phylogenetic analyses and morphology of larvae and adults provide data for investigation of relationships and species delineation. Platrilus Kazantsev, 2009, Platerodriloplesius Wittmer, 1944, and Falsocalochromus Pic, 1942 are synonymized to Platerodrilus Pic, 1921. Platrilus hirtus (Wittmer, 1938) and Pl. crassicornis (Pic, 1923) are transferred to Platerodrilus Pic, 1921. Platerodrilus hoiseni Wong, 1996 is proposed as a junior subjective synonym of Falsocalochromus ruficollis Pic, 1942. Platerodrilus is divided in three species-groups: P. paradoxus, P. major, and P. sinuatus groups defined based on the shape of genitalia and molecular phylogeny. The following species are described: Platerodrilus foliaceus sp. n., P. wongi sp. n. (P. paradoxus group); P. ngi sp. n., P. wittmeri (P. major group), P. ijenensis sp. n., P. luteus sp. n., P. maninjauensis sp. n., P. montanus sp. n., P. palawanensis sp. n., P. ranauensis sp. n., P. sibayakensis sp. n., P. sinabungensis sp. n., P. talamauensis sp. n., and P. tujuhensis sp. n. (P. sinuatus group). P. korinchiana robinsoni Blair, 1928 is elevated to the species rank as P. robinsoni Blair, 1928, stat. n. The conspecific semaphoronts are identified using molecular phylogeny for P. foliaceus sp. n., P. tujuhensis sp. n., P. montanus sp. n., P. maninjauensis sp. n.; additional female larvae are assigned to the species-groups. Diagnostic characters are illustrated and keys are provided for P. paradoxus and P. major groups. </str>

      <str>Seventeen Pachybrachis species occurring in eastern Canada [Ontario (ON), Québec (QC), New Brunswick (NB), Nova Scotia (NS), and Prince Edward Island (PE)] are treated by the authors. Two new national records were discovered, both from southernmost Ontario: P. cephalicus Fall and P. luctuosus Suffrian. Four species were new provincial records: P. cephalicus (ON), P. luctuosus (ON, QC), P. obsoletus Suffrian (NB), P. peccans (PE). A fully illustrated key to the Pachybrachis of eastern Canada is provided and supported with extensive photographs, distribution maps, and plant associations. Three species were distributed from southern Ontario into at least one province in the Maritimes (P. nigricornis (Say), P. obsoletus Suffrianand P. peccans Suffrian). Six species were distributed along the shores of the Great Lakes (Erie, Michigan, and Ontario) and rivers (Ottawa, Saguenay and St. Lawrence), but unknown from central and northern ON and QC (P. bivittatus (Say), P. hepaticus hepaticus (F. E. Melsheimer), P. othonus othonus (Say), P. pectoralis (F. E. Melsheimer), P. spumarius Suffrianand P. trinotatus (F. E. Melsheimer)). Seven species were rare, five being found exclusively from southern ON (P. calcaratus Fall, P. cephalicus, P. luridus (Fabricius), P. subfasciatus (J. E. LeConte)and P. tridens (F. E. Melsheimer)), with two having, in addition, a disjunct population in QC (P. atomarius (F. E. Melsheimer)and P. luctuosus). One species was found to be the northern most extension of an eastern United States (US) distribution into the eastern townships of QC (P. m-nigrum (F. E. Melsheimer)). There were no Pachybrachis that could be considered arctic, subarctic, or boreal species; no specimens were found from Labrador and Newfoundland, and all species had southern affinities. Pachybrachis atomarius, P. calcaratus, P. luridus, P. subfaciatus, and P. tridens, not seen over the last 30-70 years, may be extirpated from eastern Canada. </str>

      <str>Plesiadapis cookei is an extinct relative of extant euarchontans (primates, dermopterans; scandentians), which lived in North America during the late Paleocene. P. cookei body mass has been estimated to be approximately 2.2 kg, making it large compared with other species of its genus from North America, but similar to some from Europe. In particular, size as well as dental form similarities to P. russelli have been noted. However, it is thought that P. russelli evolved from P. tricuspidens, and into Platychoerops daubrei. Dental similarities among P. cookei, P. russelli, and P. daubrei have been hypothesized to reflect a more folivorous diet than utilized by P. tricuspidens. Here we test the hypothesis that P. cookei is more dietarily specialized than P. tricuspidens by quantifying functionally significant aspects of molar, premolar, and incisor forms. Casts of M(2)s and P(4)s of P. tricuspidens, P. cookei, and P. daubrei were microCT-scanned. We measured the relief index and/or the complexity from surface reconstructions of scans. Results show that P. cookei has higher M(2) relief and complexity than P. tricuspidens; P. daubrei exhibits the highest relief and complexity. Similarly, P. cookei has a more complex P(4) than P. tricuspidens, whereas that of P. daubrei exhibits the highest complexity. Finally, the I(1) of P. cookei resembles more the incisor of P. daubrei than that of P. tricuspidens. Because high relief and complexity of dentitions are related to fibrous plant diets in living mammals, these findings support the hypothesis that previously identified similarities among P. cookei, P. russelli and P. daubrei reflect a folivorous diet.</str>

      <str>Rats were trained in a discrete-trial paradigm with no intertrial interval. The first response changed an auditory stimulus for the remainder of the trial. Shocks were delivered only at the end of the trial cycle. Avoidance contingencies were defined by the conditional probability of shock, given no response (P(0)), and the conditional probability of shock given a response (P(1)). The maximal avoidance contingency was P(0)=1.0, P(1)=0, and noncontingent conditions were those for which P(0)=P(1). In Experiment I, after training on the maximal contingency, three groups of subjects experienced either P(0)=P(1)=0, P(0)=P(1)=0.5, or P(0)=P(1)=1.0. Eight of 10 subjects stopped responding under the noncontingent conditions. Experiment II studied partial contingencies by varying P(0) and P(1). For one group, P(0) was reduced holding P(1)=0. Responding decreased to zero as P(0) approached zero. A second group was studied under P(1)&gt;0, holding P(0)=1.0. For three of the six rats in this group, responding decreased to zero with increasing P(1). The other three maintained responding as P(1) was increased up to the noncontingent, P(1)=P(0)=1.0 value. The P(0) group was also studied with P(0)=P(1)&gt;0, and half of these subjects responded. The results demonstrated two modes of response to weakening or eliminating the avoidance contingency. Some subjects were sensitive to contingency only, and insensitive to changes in shock density. Approximately one half of the subjects were sensitive to both contingency and shock density. This shared control was observed only when P(1)&gt; 0.</str>

      <str>The in vitro metabolism of p,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane], an important environmental pollutant, was examined in rat liver, focusing on reductive dechlorination. When p,p'-DDT was incubated with liver microsomes of rats in the presence of NADPH or NADH, a dechlorinated metabolite, p,p'-DDD [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane], was formed under anaerobic conditions together with a dehydrochlorinated metabolite, p,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene]. p,p'-DDE was also formed from p,p'-DDD by liver microsomes. The dechlorinating activity was inhibited by carbon monoxide, metyrapone, and SKF 525-A (proadifen hydrochloride), but the dehydrochlorinating activity was unaffected. The reductase activity toward p,p'-DDT was induced by the pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital and dexamethasone. The dechlorination was catalyzed enzymatically by recombinant cytochrome P450 2B1, 3A1, 2B6, and 3A4. When p,p'-DDT was incubated with liver microsomes of rats in the presence of both a reduced pyridine nucleotide and FMN, p,p'-DDD was also formed under anaerobic conditions. In this case, the dechlorinating activity was not abolished when the microsomes were boiled. The reductase activities were inhibited by carbon monoxide. Hematin exhibited reductase activity toward p,p'-DDT in the presence of NADH and FMN. The activity of hematin was also supported by FMNH(2). The reductive dechlorination also seems to proceed nonenzymatically with the reduced flavin, catalyzed by the heme group of cytochrome P450. Similar enzymatic and nonenzymatic reducing activities were observed toward o,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(2-chlorophenyl-4-chlorophenyl)ethane].</str>

      <str>Possible prognostic variables for tumor response, time to progression (TTP), and survival in 141 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin-based chemotherapy were analyzed. None of the variables examined for their possible influence on tumor response attained significance in the stepwise logistic regression. In the univariate analysis, variables found to be strongly associated with TTP were performance status (PS) (P = 0.0301), liver involvement (P = 0.030), and the initial values of WBC (P = 0.0319), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH; P = 0.0053), gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (gamma-GT; P = 0.0013), alkaline phosphatase (ALP; P = 0.0186), albumin (P = 0.0004), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; P = 0.0014). In the Cox analysis, liver involvement (P = 0.0553), albumin (P = 0.0181), PS (P = 0.484), and ALP (P = 0.0553) were retained as independently significant variables. When only patients with liver metastases were included in the analysis, then only albumin (P &lt; 0.001) demonstrated a prognostic significance. Also, in the univariate analysis, variables predicting survival were PS (P = 0.0230), grade (P = 0.00600), liver involvement (P = 0.0002), LDH (P = 0.0001), gamma-GT (P &lt; 0.001), ALP (P = 0.0006), albumin (P = 0.0309), and CEA (P = 0.005). With the multivariate analysis, gamma-GT (P = 0.0004), albumin (P = 0.0634), and CEA (P = 0.0804) were selected as significant. In those patients who presented with liver involvement, variables predicted survival were gamma-GT (P = 0.0041), albumin (P = 0.0442), and the percentage of involved liver parenchyma (P = 0.0690). These results could be helpful for the stratification of future trials in advanced colorectal cancer.</str>

      <str>This study focused on the sorption isotherms of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p'-DDT) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE) on different original clays (i.e., zeolite, montmorillonite and attapulgite) and organoclay complexes. Sorption of organic pollutants was determined using gas chromatographic (GC) techniques to investigate the sorption behavior, and characterize the effect of, different organic cations. The original clays only sorbed low amounts of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, and the sorptive curves can be classified as L-shaped. Organoclays exhibited higher amounts of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE sorption. The p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE sorption increased with increasing total organic carbon (OC) content of the organoclays. For hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA)-modified organoclays, the dominant adsorptive medium showed the partitioning sorption of hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction, indicating no competitive sorption. The sorptive curves can be classified as C-shaped of constant partition (CP). However, benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA)-modified organoclays exhibited competitive sorption. The sorption isotherm curves can be classified as S-shaped. The sorptive capacity of the HDTMA-modified organoclays for p,p'-DDT were higher than those for p,p'-DDE, but the BTMA-modified organoclays showed a reverse trend. This can be attributed to the different structures and shapes of organic cations, giving different sorptive mechanisms. The p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE sorption onto HDTMA-modified organoclays were caused by chemical interaction, with the BTMA modified organoclays occuring due to physical sorption.</str>

      <str>Previous studies have demonstrated that uterine progesterone (P) receptor is under dual hormonal control; estradiol (E2) induces the synthesis of cytosolic P receptor, and P induces the loss of its own receptor and antagonizes E2-induced P receptor replenishment. The objective of this study was to examine the contributions of E2 and P in the replenishment of uterine P receptor during sustained P exposure. Silastic implants of varying length (0.4, 0.8, 1.5, 2.5, and 5.0 cm) were packed with crystalline P and placed sc in the flank region of ovariectomized adult female hamsters. The serum P levels obtained with these implants (2-22 ng/ml) were within the physiological range observed previously during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation in the Syrian hamster. Control animals received a blank implant (1.5 cm). Three, 5, and 7 days after placement of the implants, uterine cytosolic and nuclear P receptor levels were decreased as serum P level was increased by the P implants. Total cellular P receptor level was inversely correlated with serum P level at 3 days (r = -0.996), 5 days (r = -0.98), and 7 days (r = -0.99). To distinguish the effect of E2 and P, ovariectomized animals were maintained on Silastic implants of P (1.5 cm) or P plus E2 (1.0 cm). After 3 days, cytosolic P receptor was determined 0, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h after removal of P implants. No difference was observed in cytosolic P receptor between P and P plus E2 groups before P withdrawal. E2-maintained animals showed a significant rise of cytosolic P receptor at all time points after P withdrawal. Although P withdrawal in the absence of E2 showed no significant change in P receptor at 8 or 16 h, a significant increase in P receptor (equivalent to that of ovariectomized control animals) was observed at 24 and 48 h. Treatment of ovariectomized animals with cycloheximide significantly reduced uterine cytosolic P receptor levels 8, 18, and 24 h after treatment. These results suggest that 1) an active receptor replenishment process occurs in the absence of E2; 2) this replenishment process does not appear to be P dependent, but, rather, constitutively expressed; and 3) the rate of constitutive P receptor replenishment is slower and of lower magnitude than that promoted by E2. Because P antagonizes E2-induced P receptor, a constitutive P receptor replenishment mechanism may play an important role in the maintenance of P action during sustained P exposure, such as in pregnancy.</str>

      <str>Three constitutive forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450s) were isolated from olfactory microsomes of cattle. The purified P-450s, designated P-450bov1, P-450bov2 and P-450bov3, were electrophoretically nearly homogeneous by SDS/PAGE and their apparent relative molecular masses were estimated to be 50000, 53000 and 51000 respectively. As indicated by several criteria including the N-terminal sequence and absorption spectra, the three olfactory forms of P-450 were distinct from each other and from all the other P-450s currently known in cattle. P-450bov1 and P-450bov2 were purified in the low-spin state, whereas P-450bov3 was in the high-spin state. Studies to evaluate, by Western blot analysis, the reactivity of these purified P-450s with antibodies raised against rat hepatic P-450 2E1, 2B, 1A and 3A and rabbit olfactory P-450NMa and P-450NMb showed that P-450bov3 strongly cross-reacted with anti-P-450NMb IgG, and P-450bov1 moderately with anti-P-450NMa IgG. As determined by immunoblots, P-450bov1 and P-450bov3 represented a great portion of the total olfactory P-450. In a reconstituted system with NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase and phospholipids, P-450bov1 was more active in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds (i.e. O-de-ethylation of ethoxycoumarin and N-demethylation of hexamethylphosphoramide) than towards endogenous substrates (testosterone and progesterone). Conversely, P-450bov3 metabolized the xenobiotics at lower rates but exhibited total oxidation rates of the above sex hormones higher than those of P-450bov1. From the comparison of the catalytic, immunochemical and structural properties, it was inferred that P-450bov1 and P-450bov3 are the bovine orthologues of P-450NMa (2A) and P-450NMb (2G1) respectively, the only two olfactory P-450s previously purified from rabbit. P-450bov2, which showed low activity toward some exogenous and endogenous compounds, represents a novel purified olfactory hemoprotein possibly belonging to the 3A subfamily. These results are consistent with a specific presence of catalytically and structurally similar P-450s, at least for the major ones, in the olfactory mucosa of mammals.</str>

      <str>Three forms of cytochrome P-450, tentatively designated P-450(M-1), P-450(M-2), and P-450(M-3), and one form of cytochrome P-450, P-450(F-1), were purified from the liver microsomes of untreated male and female rats, respectively. Each purified form of the cytochrome showed a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gave a minimum molecular weight of 51,000 for P-450(M-1), 48,000 for P-450(M-2), 49,000 for P-450(M-3), and 50,000 for P-450(F-1). The carbon monoxide-difference spectra of reduced P-450(M-1), P-450(M-2), P-450(M-3), and P-450(F-1) showed an absorption maximum at 451, 451, 448, and 449 nm, respectively. Judging from the absolute absorption spectra, the four forms of cytochrome P-450 were of low-spin type in the oxidized forms. The antibodies against P-450(M-2) did not crossreact with the other forms in the Ouchterlony double diffusion test, whereas the immunodiffusion test showed immunocrossreactivity between P-450(M-1) and P-450(F-1), P-450(M-1) and P-450(M-3), and P-450(M-3) and P-450(F-1). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the four forms confirmed that they were different molecular species, although significant homology was noticed among P-450(M-1), P-450(M-3), and P-450(F-1). The quantitation of P-450(M-1) and P-450(F-1) in liver microsomes by quantitative immunoprecipitation confirmed that these two forms of cytochrome P-450 were developmentally induced in male and female rats, respectively. P-450(M-2) was also developmentally induced in male rats. In a reconstituted system containing NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, P-450(M-1) oxidized benzphetamine at a high rate, whereas the other forms had low activity toward benzphetamine. None of the four forms showed high activity toward benzo(a)pyrene. P-450(M-1) catalyzed the hydroxylation testosterone at the 16 alpha and 2 alpha positions, whereas P-450(M-2) catalyzed the 15 alpha hydroxylation of the same substrate.</str>

      <str>Three hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450 (P-450f, P-450g, and P-450h) have been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from both untreated and ethanol-treated adult male rats. By all criteria examined, the hemoproteins isolated from untreated rats are indistinguishable from the corresponding enzymes purified from rats administered ethanol. Highly purified cytochromes P-450f, P-450g and P-450h are characterized by minimum Mr of 51,000, 50,000, and 51,000, respectively, and unique coordinates in two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The CO-reduced spectral maxima of cytochromes P-450f and P-450g are at 447-448 nm, and the peak of cytochrome P-450h is at 451 nm. Cytochrome P-450h is a versatile catalyst exhibiting high activity toward benzphetamine, hexobarbital, and estradiol-17 beta and moderate activity toward benzo[alpha]pyrene and zoxazolamine. In contrast, cytochromes P-450f and P-450g have low metabolic activity for these substrates. The three hemoproteins catalyze the metabolism of testosterone with different regio- and stereospecificities and overall rates. Both cytochromes P-450f and P-450h catalyze the hydroxylation of testosterone at the 16 alpha-position; however, cytochrome P-450h also oxidizes the steroid at the 2 alpha- and 17 beta-position (androstenedione formation). Testosterone is oxidatively metabolized at the 6 beta-, 15 alpha- and an unknown position by cytochrome P-450g. Peptide maps, generated by proteolytic or chemical digestion of the hemoproteins, indicate that cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, and P-450h differ structurally from each other and five previously characterized rat hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450 (P-450a, P-450b, P-450c, P-450d, and P-450e). Cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, and P-450h do not react with antibodies directed against these inducible hemoproteins by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion in the presence of detergent; however, in the absence of detergent, cytochrome P-450f cross-reacts weakly with anti-P-450b. Results of this study indicate that rat hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450 are composed of at least four hemoproteins with CO-reduced absorbance maxima between 447-448 nm. Furthermore, a minimum of four microsomal cytochromes P-450 are now known to 16 alpha-hydroxylate testosterone.</str>

      <str>A total of twenty seven middle maturing rice varieties as parent materials were divided into four types based on P use efficiency for grain yield in 2011 by field experiment with normal phosphorus (P) application. The rice variety with high yield and high P efficiency was identified by pot experiment with normal and low P applications, and the contribution rates of various P efficiencies to yield were investigated in 2012. There were significant genotype differences in yield and P efficiency of the test materials. GRLu17/AiTTP//Lu17_2 (QR20) was identified as a variety with high yield and high P efficiency, and its yields at the low and normal rates of P application were 1.96 and 1.92 times of that of Yuxiang B, respectively. The contribution rate of P accumulation to yield was greater than that of P grain production efficiency and P harvest index across field and pot experiments. The contribution rates of P accumulation and P grain production efficiency to yield were not significantly different under the normal P condition, whereas obvious differences were observed under the low P condition (66.5% and 26.6%). The minimal contribution to yield was P harvest index (11.8%). Under the normal P condition, the contribution rates of P accumulation to yield and P harvest index were the highest at the jointing-heading stage, which were 93.4% and 85.7%, respectively. In addition, the contribution rate of P accumulation to grain production efficiency was 41.8%. Under the low P condition, the maximal contribution rates of P accumulation to yield and grain production efficiency were observed at the tillering-jointing stage, which were 56.9% and 20.1% respectively. Furthermore, the contribution rate of P accumulation to P harvest index was 16.0%. The yield, P accumulation, and P harvest index of QR20 significantly increased under the normal P condition by 20.6%, 18.1% and 18.2% respectively compared with that in the low P condition. The rank of the contribution rates of P efficiencies to the yield was in order of P uptake efficiency &gt; P utilization efficiency &gt; P transportation efficiency. The greatest contribution rate of P accumulation to the yield was noticed at the jointing-heading stage with the normal P application while it reached the maximal value at the tillering-jointing stage with the low P application. Therefore, these two stages may be the critical periods to coordinate high yield and high P efficiency in rice.</str>

      <str>New inbred strains of guinea pigs, JY 1, JY 2, JY 3, JY 6, JY 9 and JY 10 have been established in this Institute. Serologic studies of guinea pig leukocyte antigens (GPLA antigens) were carried out in order to examine their major histocompatibility complex (GPLA complex). Antisera specific for Ia antigens were raised by cross-immunization of NIH strain 2 (NIH 2) and NIH strain 13 (NIH 13) guinea pigs, well known inbred guinea pigs. The sera identified four distinct Ia specificities, which were designated as Ia.2a, Ia2b, Ia.13a and Ia.13b. Six antigenic specificities different from the above Ia specificities were identified by sera obtained by appropriate immunization of the inbred guinea pigs and were designated as P.1, P.2, P.3, P.4, P.5 and P.6. Antigenic specificities of GPLA antigens recognized in inbred guinea pigs were : NIH 2 (Ia.2a, Ia.2b, P.1, P.2, P.O, P.4), NIH 13 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.1, P.2, P.3, P.4), JY 1 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.5), JY 2 (Ia.2b, Ia.13b, P.3, P.4, P.6), JY 3 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.2, P.4, P.5), JY 6 (Ia.2b, Ia.13b, P.3, P.6), JY 9 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.4, P.5), JY 10 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.2, P.3, P.4, P.6), JY 9 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.4, P.5), JY 10 (Ia.13a, Ia.13b, P.2, P.3, P.4, P.6). The correspondence of these specificities to those already reported was discussed and the P.2 or P.4 was considered to be an additional specificity of GPLA antigens that have not been reported yet. As the new inbred strains of guinea pigs were thus found to possess characteristic GPLA complex, which differ from each other and from those of NIH 2 and NIH 13 strain, they should be useful for studies of roles of the major histocompatibility complex in the immune system.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus is an expensive nutrient to supplement, and excess may lead to manure P challenges. Therefore, minimizing dietary P to meet requirements is important. Two experiments were conducted to determine the P requirement of finishing cattle (Exp. 1) and to evaluate the effects of feeding different P concentrations on the quantity and route of P excretion (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, 60 heifers (BW = 278 kg +/- 17 kg) were individually fed 1 of 5 dietary P concentrations (0.10, 0.17, 0.24, 0.31, or 0.38% P). Cattle performance, plasma P concentration, bone characteristics, and bone P concentration were used to determine the P requirement. Intake and ADG increased quadratically (P &lt; 0.01) as dietary P increased. Plasma P in heifers receiving the 0.10% treatment was less (P &lt; 0.01) than the other treatments and suggested that these heifers were experiencing a P deficiency. Total ash weight of the phalanx bones increased linearly (P &lt; 0.01) as dietary P increased. In Exp. 2 using a 5 x 5 Latin square design, 5 different diets varying in P concentration (0.12, 0.27, 0.42, 0.30, and 0.36% P) were fed to steers to evaluate route and quantity of P excreted. Steers excreted little (1.78 g/d on average) P in the urine as a percentage of total P excretion. Steers on the 0.12% P diet excreted very little P in urine (0.50 g/d). Excretion of P was less (P &lt; 0.05) for the cattle fed 0.12% P compared with all other treatments. Results from cattle performance, plasma P concentrations, and bone characteristics indicate that the heifers fed 0.10% P were experiencing a deficiency and the P requirement of finishing heifers is between 0.10 and 0.17% P. Dietary P concentrations of 0.10 to 0.17% P resulted in decreased P excretion. Supplementation of mineral P is unnecessary in grain-based feedlot diets because dietary P will greatly exceed the requirements (&lt;0.17%).</str>

      <str>Plants have developed several strategies for coping with phosphorus (P) deficiency. However, the details of the regulation of gene expression of adaptations to low P are still unclear. Using a cDNA microarray, transcriptomic analyses were carried out of the rice genes regulated by P deficiency and P re-supply to P-deficient plants. The OsPI1 gene, which was isolated as the most significant up-regulated gene under -P conditions, was also the most significant down-regulated gene following P re-supply. Many starch metabolism-related genes, as well as several genes for P(i)-liberating enzymes, were up-regulated by -P treatment, suggesting a homeostatic contribution to the P(i) concentration in leaf tissues. mRNAs for glucanases were also induced by P re-supply: these are suspected to play a role in loosening the cell wall compounds. Most of the genes up-regulated by -P treatment were down-regulated by P re-supply, suggesting that their responses were specific to -P conditions. Conversely, the number of genes up-regulated by P re-supply was also larger following P re-supply than in the -P condition. It is proposed that the genes up-regulated by P re-supply play an important role in P acquisition by P-deficient plants.</str>

For 1 patient studied during 3 separate occasions -1,5 and 12 months post-transplant--the period of the rhythm for the (P-P)R time interval progressively elongated from 23.7 hr (1 month post-transplant) to 26.1 hour (5 months post-transplant) and finally to 32.3 hr (12 months post-transplant and 4 months prior to death) while the (P-P)D remained around 24.0 hr (range 23.8 to 24.6 hr). Change in the rhythm's period in (P-P)R may reflect events associated with rejection, continuing necrosis of cardiac tissue and/or medications, among others.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) starved algae have a capacity to rapidly take up P when resupplied to P. This study was set-up to measure to what extent P starvation enhances the potential of algae to utilize organic P forms. The initial (&lt;0.5 h) PO4 uptake rates of cells of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata increased up to 18-fold with increasing starvation. Algae from different levels of P starvation were subsequently exposed to different model organic P forms and carrier-free (33)PO4. Uptake (1h) of P from organic P-increased up to 5-fold with increasing P starvation. The bioavailability of organic P, relative to PO4, was calculated from uptake of (31)P and (33)P isotopes assuming no isotopic exchange with organic P-forms. This relative bioavailability ranged from 0 to 57% and remained generally unaffected by the extent of P-starvation. This result was found for cells that were either or not treated by a wash method to remove extracellular phosphatases. Short-term P uptake rate sharply increases with decreasing internal P content of the algal cells but the bioavailability of organic P, relative to PO4, is not enhanced. Such finding suggests that P-starvation enhances PO4 uptake capacity and organic P hydrolysis capacity to about the same extent.</str>

      <str>We investigated (1) the relationship between the baseline and inspiratory muscle training (IMT) induced increase in maximal inspiratory pressure (P(I,max)) and (2) the relative contributions of the inspiratory chest wall muscles and the diaphragm (P(oes)/P(di)) to P(I,max) prior to and following-IMT. Experiment 1: P(I,max) was assessed during a Müeller manoeuvre before and after 4-wk IMT (n=30). Experiment 2: P(I,max) and the relative contribution of the inspiratory chest wall muscles to the diaphragm (P(oes)/P(di)) were assessed during a Müeller manoeuvre before and after 4-wk IMT (n=20). Experiment 1: P(I,max) increased 19% (P&lt;0.01) post-IMT and was correlated with baseline P(I,max) (r=-0.373, P&lt;0.05). Experiment 2: baseline P(I,max) was correlated with P(oe)/P(di) (r=0.582, P&lt;0.05) and after IMT PI,max increased 22% and Poe/Pdi increased 5% (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, baseline P(I,max) and the contribution of the chest wall inspiratory muscles relative to the diaphragm affect, in part, baseline and IMT-induced P(I,max). Great care should be taken when designing future IMT studies to ensure parity in the between-subject baseline P(I,max).</str>

      <str>Oxidation of p,p'-biphenol with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-hydrogen peroxide in the presence of bovine serum albumin or with bone marrow cell homogenate-hydrogen peroxide resulted in the formation of reactive products that conjugate with protein. Glutathione prevented the protein binding. Glutathione readily reacted with p,p'-biphenoquinone, the principal oxidation product of p,p'-biphenol in the HRP-hydrogen peroxide system and resulted in the formation of several glutathione conjugates, p,p'-biphenol and small amounts of oxidized glutathione. The major glutathione conjugate was identified as 3-(glutathion-S-yl)-p,p'-biphenol by high field nuclear magnetic resonance and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The same conjugate was formed in the bone marrow homogenate-hydrogen peroxide system. p,p'-Biphenoquinone reduction by glutathione to p,p'-biphenol without glutathione oxidation was explained by the rapid reduction of p,p'-biphenoquinone by 3-(glutathion-S-yl)-p,p'-biphenol.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study was to assist surgeons treating calcaneal fractures in choosing the most predictive fracture classification and clinical outcome tool.</str>
      <str>For 152 patients (189 calcaneal fractures; average followup, 9.9 years), all fractures were classified in accordance with the Essex-Lopresti, OTA, Regazzoni, and Sanders classifications and matched with the following scores: AOFAS score, CNHF, FOA, MFS, Rowe, MFA, SF-36, and VAS.</str>
      <str>The Essex-Lopresti classification showed no statistically significant relation with any of the clinical scores (p &gt; 0.05). The OTA classification related statistically significant with the MFS (p = 0.006), AOFAS score (p = 0.013), FOA (p = 0.019), Rowe (p = 0.0027), and MFA score (p = 0.03). The Regazzoni classification correlated with the AOFAS score (p = 0.003), MFS (p = 0.002), Rowe (p = 0.002), CNHF (p = 0.0001), FOA (p = 0.003), MFA score (p = 0.002), and VAS (p = 0.005). The Sanders classification corrrelated with the AOFAS score (p = 0.007), MFS (p = 0.001), Rowe (p = 0.001), CNHF (p = 0.024), FOA (p = 0.021), MFA score (p = 0.036), and VAS (p = 0.014).</str>

      <str>The genetic variability of seven Phaseolus taxa has been evaluated on the basis of molecular data and the results have used to clarify the phyletic relationships between several taxa of the P. coccineus L. complex. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from 33 populations was digested with six restriction endonucleases, revealing some polymorphisms that made it possible to divide most of the taxa into two main groups: the subspecies of P. coccineus on the one hand, and P. vulgaris L., P. polyanthus Greenman and P. costaricensis (Freytag and Debouck) on the other hand. P. polyanthus is closer to P. vulgaris than the other taxa of the second group and should be considered as a separate species. The position of the wild species P. costaricensis is intermediate between P. coccineus and P. polyanthus. P. glabellus shows sufficient polymorphisms at the cpDNA level to be recognized as a separate species, as previously suggested from total seed-protein electrophoretic studies. These results favour the hypothesis of a common phylogeny for P. vulgaris, P. polyanthus, P. costaricensis and P. coccineus from a single wild ancestor. Although cpDNA is generally known to be uniform at the intraspecific level, some additional polymorphisms were also detected within P. vulgaris, P. polyanthus and P. coccineus. Further studies are required to understand the significance of the latter. </str>

      <str>Sediment phosphorus (P) fractions and sorption characteristics and P release from intact sediment cores of Baiyangdian Lake in North China in spring 2009 were investigated. Results of chemical fractionation showed that total P (TP) content in sediment ranged from 443 to 611 mg kg( -1). Of the P fractions including inorganic P (IP) and organic P (OP), IP was a dominant component of TP and present in the form of P bounded to calcium (Ca-P) while the bioavailable P content bounded to Al, Fe, and Mn oxides and hydroxides (Fe/Al-P) varied from 14 to 102 mg kg( -1). The batch experiments showed that the sediments had appreciable maximum P adsorption capacity from 141.86 to 377.37 mg kg( -1). However, the zero P equilibrium concentration (C⁰(eq))in most sampling sites was larger than the P concentration in water column. Accordingly, the sediments from those sampling sites would release P into the overlying water at the positive P flux rates as a P release source. Significant positive correlation between P flux rates and Fe/Al-P revealed that the sediment P release would mainly originate from the bioavailable P fraction. It is evident that the inherent phosphorus present in lake sediments would be a major threat to the water quality and ecosystem reservation in Baiyangdian lake.</str>

      <str>Variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1143 bp) was examined to estimate the phylogenetic relationships of taxa within the Peromyscus boylii species group. In addition, phylogenetic relationships among the aztecus, boylii, and truei species groups were addressed. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and maximum-parsimony (weighted and equally weighted) analyses produced similar topologies with P. boylii, P. beatae, P. simulus, P. stephani, P. madrensis, P. levipes, and three undescribed taxa from western Mexico forming a monophyletic unit. At least two of the undescribed taxa from western Mexico potentially represent species. Members of the P. aztecus species group formed a clade separate from the P. boylii group and should be recognized as a distinct species group. P. sagax, P. polius, and P. pectoralis, formerly placed in the P. boylii species group, generally formed an unresolved polytomy with the P. truei, P. aztecus, and P. boylii species groups. P. attwateri formed a sister taxon relationship with members of the P. truei species group (P. difficilis and P. nasutus) and should be considered a member of this group. Members of the P. truei species group did not form a monophyletic unit, indicating that this species group is not monophyletic and may be composed of two assemblages.</str>

      <str>p, p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the major metabolite of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), is an organochlorine pollutant and associated with cancer progression. The present study investigated the possible effects of p,p'-DDE on colorectal cancer and the involved molecular mechanism. The results indicated that exposure to low concentrations of p,p'-DDE from 10(-10) to 10(-7) M for 96 h markedly enhanced proliferations of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Moreover, p,p'-DDE exposure could activate Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog/Gli1 signaling cascades, and the expression level of c-Myc and cyclin D1 was significantly increased. Consistently, p,p'-DDE-induced cell proliferation along with upregulated c-Myc and cyclin D1 were impeded by β-catenin siRNA or Gli1 siRNA. In addition, p,p'-DDE was able to activate NADPH oxidase, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce GSH content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and calatase (CAT) activities. Treatment with antioxidants prevented p,p'-DDE-induced cell proliferation and signaling pathways of Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog/Gli1. These results indicated that p,p'-DDE promoted colorectal cancer cell proliferation through Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog/Gli1 signalings mediated by oxidative stress. The finding suggests an association between p,p'-DDE exposure and the risk of colorectal cancer progression.</str>

The oral species, P. buccae, P. oralis, and P. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. The urogenital species, P. bivia and P. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with P. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than P. disiens. Within the oral species group, P. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did P. buccae and P. oris. The finding of species-related different binding properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, P. bivia and P. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, P. buccae, P. oralis, and P. oris. Moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of Prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.</str>

      <str>Mean duration of NTZ treatment was 31.3 ± 16.3 months in S-P and 32.1 ± 15.1 months in N-SP (p = 0.56).

Disability progression after NTZ start was similarly low in S-P and NS-P. However, when compared to before NTZ start, disability progression was significantly reduced in S-P (p = 0.017), but not in NS-P (p = 0.68). This was largely mediated by a higher disability progression before NTZ start in S-P than N-SP. The risk of developing N2TL during NTZ was not different between S-P and NS-P (p = 0.10).</str>
      <str>NTZ similarly reduced the occurrence of relapses and NT2L in S-P and NS-P, whereas the effect on disability progression was particularly evident in the presence of spinal involvement. NTZ appears to be a treatment of high efficacy in both S-P and NS-P.</str>

      <str>Although Ki67 measurement by immunohistochemistry has been widely used as a prognostic index in cancers, it has not been reported in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). Hence, this study examines the prognostic significance of Ki67 in MPM.</str>
      <str>Specimens from 42 MPM patients were screened for Ki67 expression using immunohistochemistry. Ki67 expression was classified into 2 groups on the basis of expression (&lt;25%=low; ≥25%=high) using standard methods. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the significance of Ki67 was assessed in different clinicopathologic categories.</str>
      <str>High expression of Ki67 (≥25% by immunohistochemical evaluation) was correlated with poor survival in the overall group (P=0.001); male sex (P=0.001); female sex (P=0.001); epithelioid tumors (P=0.001): male epithelioid (P=0.001), female epithelioid (P=0.003); peritoneal cancer index (PCI): PCI&lt;20 (P=0.001), PCI≥20 (P=0.002); and age at diagnosis (AAD): AAD&lt;60 years (P=0.001), AAD≥60 years (P=0.004). Independent of Ki67, male sex (P=0.007), sarcomatoid histology (P=0.001), PCI≥20 (P=0.013), and AAD≥60 years (P=0.004) correlated with poor survival. Multivariate analysis showed that only AAD≥60 years (P=0.049) and high Ki67 expression for all tumors (P=0.031), male sex (P=0.038), female sex (P=0.021), epithelioid tumors (P=0.044), and AAD&lt;60 years (P=0.029) were statistically significant.</str>

      <str>The influence of phosphorus (P) availability on growth and P uptake was investigated in South African Proteaceae: (1) Protea compacta R.Br., endemic on severely nutrient-impoverished colluvial sands; (2) Protea obtusifolia Bueck ex Meissner; and (3) Leucadendron meridianum I. J. Williams, the latter both endemic on comparatively fertile limestone-derived soils. Plants were grown hydroponically in 1000 L tanks at 0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 microm P for 14 weeks. Biomass accumulation was influenced by P availability, doubling as [P] increased from 0.1 to 1.0 microm. Total biomass was greatest for P. compacta, but L. meridianum and P. obtusifolia had two to four times greater relative biomass accumulation at 0.1 and 1.0 microm [P]. Proteoid root clusters developed at both 0.01 and 0.1 microm[P], but were suppressed at 1.0 microm [P]; this was a 10-fold lower [P] than previously reported to inhibit cluster root formation. Rates of net P uptake at 5 microm P decreased in response to increased P availability from 0.01 to 1.0 microm P. Significant between-species differences in rates of P uptake and capacity to down-regulate P uptake were observed: P. compacta &lt; P. obtusifolia &lt; L. meridianum. The species responses are discussed in terms of adaptation to mosaics in soil P availability and the high beta diversity in the natural habitat.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus losses in runoff from application of manures and biosolids to agricultural land are implicated in the degradation of water quality in the Chesapeake and Delaware Inland Bays. We conducted an incubation study to determine the relative P solubility and bioavailability, referred to as P source coefficients (PSCs), for organic P sources, which are typically land-applied in the Mid-Atlantic USA. Nine organic and one inorganic (KH2PO4) P amendments were applied to an Evesboro loamy sand (mesic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments) at a rate of 60 mg P kg(-1) and incubated for 8 wk with subsamples analyzed at 2 and 8 wk. There was an increase in Mehlich-3 P (M3-P), water-soluble P (WS-P), iron-oxide strip extractable P (FeO-P), and Mehlich-3 P saturation ratio (M3-PSR) with P additions, which varied by P source. The trend of relative extractable WS-P, FeO-P, and M3-P generally followed the pattern: inorganic P &gt; liquid and deep pit manures &gt; manures and biosolids treated with metal salts or composted. We found significant differences in the availability of P from varying organic P sources. The use of PSCs may be beneficial when determining the risk of P losses from land application of manures and other organic P sources and could be used in risk assessments such as a P site index. These PSCs may also be useful for determining P application rates when organic P sources are applied to P deficient soils for use as a fertilizer source.</str>

The acronyms and sequences for these peptides are as follows: PRG9-2 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-CONH2, PRG9-3 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-CONH2, PRG9-4 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-CONH2, PRG9-5 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-CONH2, PRG9-6 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-CONH2, PRG9-7 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-G(7)-CONH2, PRG9-8 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-G(7)-K(8)-CONH2, and PRG9-9 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-G(7)-K(8)-P(9)-CONH2. The presence of stable poly-L-proline II-like 'mini' helices in the solution state was found to be dependent on peptide chain length, pH, salt, and organic solvent type. Other conformational features such as kinks and beta-/gamma-turns were also found in the larger peptides. Solid-state peptide conformations were not necessarily related to their solution-state counterparts. Poly-L-proline II-like 'mini' helices, kinks, and beta-/gamma-turns were similarly found in the various substrate-bound PRG9 peptides. Surface energetics parameters suggested specific orientations for PRG9 peptides and their constituent acids and homopolymers.</str>

      <str>The solution-state conformations of eight proline-containing peptide fragments found in human salivary proline-rich glycoprotein (PRG) were investigated in 2 x distilled water (treated with metal ion chelating resin) using 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The peptide sequences and acronyms were as follows: PRG9-2 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-CONH2, PRG9-3 = NH2-G(1)P(2)-P(3)-CONH2, PRG9-4 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-CONH2, PRG9-5 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-CONH2, PRG9-6 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-CONH2, PRG9-7 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-G(7)-CONH2, PRG9-8 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-G(7)-K(8)-CONH2 and PRG9-9 = NH2-G(1)-P(2)-P(3)-P(4)-H(5)-P(6)-G(7)-K(8)-P(9)-CONH2. Sequence-specific resonance assignments from the 13C-NMR spectra indicated that the trans proline isomer dominated the conformations of the peptides. CD results clearly showed the presence of the poly-L-proline II helix as the major conformation in PRG9-3----PRG9-5, supplemented by beta- and/or gamma-turns in PRG9-6----PRG9-9. These data suggest that in "metal free" water, native PRG could contain several small poly-L-proline II helices along with beta- and/or gamma-turns. Since proline is the major amino acid present in native PRG, these localized conformations may contribute to PRG's global conformation and act as a primary force in determining its biological activities.</str>

      <str>A comparison of the cytochrome P-450 forms induced in rat liver microsomes by phenobarbital on the one hand, and 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin on the other hand, was performed using specific antibodies: anti-P-450 B2 PB IG (against the phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P-450) and anti-P-450 B2 BNF IG (against the beta-naphthoflavone-induced cytochrome P-450). On DEAE-cellulose chromatography, four cytochrome P-450 fractions were separated, called P-450 A (non-adsorbed), P-450 Ba, P-450 Bb and P-450 Bc, from control, phenobarbital-, 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone- and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-treated rats. Cytochrome P-450 A fractions appeared to be unmodified by the inducers, whereas the specifically induced cytochrome P-450 forms were always recovered in Bb fractions. The P-450 Bb fractions induced by 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exhibited common antigenic determinants, comparable catalytic activities (benzphetamine N-demethylase, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase) and similar mol. wts. Moreover, the inhibition patterns by the two antibodies of benzphetamine N-demethylase and benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activities catalysed by 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin microsomes or by the corresponding P-450 Bb fractions in a reconstituted system were quite identical. By these different criteria, beta-naphthoflavone, 3-methylcholanthrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin seem to induce a common cytochrome P-450 species in rat liver.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) supplementation is costly and can result in excess P excretion. This study investigated the effects of reducing dietary P on milk production and P excretion in dairy cows over a full lactation.</str>
      <str>Forty-five multiparous Holstein dairy cows were divided into 15 blocks according to expected calving date and previous milk yield, and assigned randomly to one of the three dietary treatments: 0.37, 0.47, and 0.57% P (DM basis); these P levels represent the NRC recommendations, Chinese recommendations, and the amount of dietary P commonly fed by Chinese dairy farmers, respectively. Average daily feed intake was calculated from monthly data on feed offered and refused. Milk yields of individual cows were recorded weekly, and milk samples were taken for analysis of protein, fat, solids-not-fat, lactose, and somatic cell count. Blood samples were collected on days -6, -3, 0, 3, 6 relative to calving, and then monthly throughout lactation, and analyzed for P and Ca concentrations. Spot samples of feces and urine were collected for 3 consecutive d during weeks 12, 24, and 36, and P concentrations were analyzed. Reproduction and health data were recorded.</str>
      <str>Dietary P did not affect dry matter intake or milk yield (P &gt; 0.10). Milk fat content was slightly higher in cows fed 0.37% P than in cows fed 0.47% P (P = 0.05). Serum concentrations of P and Ca did not reflect dietary P content (P &gt; 0.10). Fecal and urinary P both declined linearly (P &lt; 0.05) as dietary P decreased from 0.57 to 0.37%. Fecal P content was 25% less when dietary P was 0.37% compared to 0.57%. Health events and reproductive performance were not associated with dietary P content (P &gt; 0.05).</str>
      <str>Lowering dietary P from 0.57 to 0.37% did not negatively affect milk production, but did significantly reduce P excretion into environment.</str>

      <str>Currently, several state and federal agencies are proposing upper limits on soil test phosphorus (P), above which animal manures cannot be applied, based on the assumption that high P concentrations in runoff are due to high soil test P. Recent studies show that other factors are more indicative of P concentrations in runoff from areas where manure is being applied. The original P index was developed as an alternative P management tool incorporating factors affecting both the source and transport of P. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of multiple variables on P concentrations in runoff water and to construct a P source component of a P index for pastures that incorporates these effects. The evaluated variables were: (i) soil test P, (ii) soluble P in poultry litter, (iii) P in poultry diets, (iv) fertilizer type, and (v) poultry litter application rate. Field studies with simulated rainfall showed that P runoff was affected by the amount of soluble P applied in the fertilizer source. Before manure applications, soil test P was directly related to soluble P concentrations in runoff water. However, soil test P had little effect on P runoff after animal manure was applied. Unlike most other P indices, weighting factors of the P source components in the P index for pastures are based on results from runoff studies conducted under various management scenarios. As a result, weighting factors for the P source potential variables are well justified. A modification of the P index using scientific data should strengthen the ability of the P index concept to evaluate locations and management alternatives for P losses.</str>

      <str>Dolichyl [beta-32P]pyrophosphate ([beta-32P]Dol-P-P) has been prepared chemically to study Dol-P-P phosphatase in calf brain. Calf brain microsomes catalyze the enzymatic release of 32Pi from exogenous [beta-32P]Dol-P-P by a bacitracin-sensitive reaction. [32P]Pyrophosphate was not detected with the water-soluble product even when 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate was added to impede pyrophosphatase activity. A substantial fraction of the Dol-P-P phosphatase activity can be solubilized by treating brain microsomes with 3% Triton X-100. The detergent extracts catalyze the enzymatic release of 32Pi from [beta-32P]Dol-P-P and the conversion of [14C]undecaprenyl pyrophosphate to [14C]undecaprenyl monophosphate. The solubilized Dol-P-P phosphatase activity: 1) is optimal at neutral pH; 2) is inhibited by Mn2+ and stimulated by EDTA; 3) exhibits an apparent Km = 20 microM for Dol-P-P; 4) is competitively inhibited by undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, and 5) is blocked by bacitracin. Solubilized Dol-P-P phosphatase activity differs from Dol-P phosphatase activity present in the same detergent extracts with respect to: 1) thermolability at 50 degrees C, 2) effect of 20 mM EDTA, and 3) sensitivity to phosphate and fluoride ions. These studies describe the chemical synthesis of [beta-32P]Dol-P-P for use in a convenient assay of Dol-P-P phosphatase activity. A procedure for the solubilization of Dol-P-P phosphatase activity from microsomes is presented, and an enzymological comparison indicates that Dol-P-P and Dol-P phosphatase are separate enzymes in calf brain.</str>

      <str>Mitotane (1,1-dichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, o,p'-DDD) represents one of the most active drugs for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. Its metabolites 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl) acetic acid (=o,p'-DDA) and 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2 dichloroethene (=o,p'-DDE) partly contribute to its pharmacological effects. Because mitotane has a narrow therapeutic index and causes pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, knowledge about these compounds' effects on drug metabolizing and transporting proteins is crucial. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, our study confirmed the strong inducing effects of o,p'-DDD on mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4, 30-fold) and demonstrated that other enzymes and transporters are also induced (e.g., CYP1A2, 8.4-fold; ABCG2 (encoding breast resistance cancer protein, BCRP), 4.2-fold; ABCB1 (encoding P-glycoprotein, P-gp) 3.4-fold). P-gp induction was confirmed at the protein level. o,p'-DDE revealed a similar induction profile, however, with less potency and o,p'-DDA had only minor effects. Reporter gene assays clearly confirmed o,p'-DDD to be a PXR activator and for the first time demonstrated that o,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDA also activate PXR albeit with lower potency. Using isolated, recombinant CYP enzymes, o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDE were shown to strongly inhibit CYP2C19 (IC50 = 0.05 and 0.09 µM). o,p'-DDA exhibited only minor inhibitory effects. In addition, o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, and o,p'-DDA are demonstrated to be neither substrates nor inhibitors of BCRP or P-gp function. In summary, o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDE might be potential perpetrators in pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions through induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters and by potent inhibition of CYP2C19. In tumors over-expressing BCRP or P-gp, o,p'-DDD and its metabolites should retain their efficacy due to a lack of substrate characteristics.</str>

      <str>Four isozymes, designated P-450m50a, P-450m50b, P-450m51a, and P-450m51b, have been isolated from liver microsomes of untreated male CD-1 mice. Electrophoretograms revealed that the molecular weights of P-450m51a and P-450m51b were about 51,000, whereas those of P-450m50a and P-450m50b were about 49,700 and 49,500, respectively. The present study is concerned mainly with the elucidation of the characteristics of P-450m50b and P-450m51a, since they appear to be major forms of cytochrome P-450 in mouse liver. End group analyses have revealed that these forms differ not only from P1-450, isolated previously from mouse liver, but also from any other known isozymes of cytochrome P-450. Naphthalene was metabolized by both P-450m50b and P-450m51a, but the turnover number of P-450m50b was 2-4 times greater than that of P-450m51a. Moreover, P-450m50b formed predominantly (1R,2S)-naphthalene 1,2-oxide, as determined by the formation of trans-1(R)-hydroxy-2(R)-glutathionyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, whereas P-450m51a formed both (1R,2S)- and (1S,2R)-naphthalene 1,2-oxide in about equal amounts. Although cytochrome P-450c, isolated from rat liver, is also known to convert naphthalene predominantly to (1R,2S)-naphthalene 1,-2-oxide, an antibody prepared against cytochrome P-450c failed to inhibit the formation of the glutathione conjugate when the 1R,2S-oxide was formed by either pure P-450m50b or by microsomes from mouse lung. Thus, P-450m50b probably is not orthologous to cytochrome P-450c.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Accurate measurements of arterial P(CO(2)) (P(a,CO(2))) currently require blood sampling because the end-tidal P(CO(2)) (P(ET,CO(2))) of the expired gas often does not accurately reflect the mean alveolar P(CO(2)) and P(a,CO(2)). Differences between P(ET,CO(2)) and P(a,CO(2)) result from regional inhomogeneities in perfusion and gas exchange. We hypothesized that breathing via a sequential gas delivery circuit would reduce these inhomogeneities sufficiently to allow accurate prediction of P(a,CO(2)) from P(ET,CO(2)). We tested this hypothesis in five healthy middle-aged men by comparing their P(ET,CO(2)) values with P(a,CO(2)) values at various combinations of P(ET,CO(2)) (between 35 and 50 mmHg), P(O(2)) (between 70 and 300 mmHg), and breathing frequencies (f; between 6 and 24 breaths min(-1)). Once each individual was in a steady state, P(a,CO(2)) was collected in duplicate by consecutive blood samples to assess its repeatability. The difference between P(ET,CO(2)) and average P(a,CO(2)) was 0.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg (P = 0.53; 95% CI -2.8, 3.8 mmHg) whereas the mean difference between the two measurements of P(a,CO(2)) was -0.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg (95% CI -3.7, 2.6 mmHg). Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed no significant differences between P(ET,CO(2)) and P(a,CO(2)) over the ranges of P(O(2)), f and target P(ET,CO(2)). We conclude that when breathing via a sequential gas delivery circuit, P(ET,CO(2)) provides as accurate a measurement of P(a,CO(2)) as the actual analysis of arterial blood.</str>

The bioavailability of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, As, Cd, Cu, and Pb from five field-aged New Zealand orchards and three grazing soils was assessed by using a 28-d bioassay with Aporrectodea caliginosa and chemical assays. Significant relationships were found between total soil and earthworm tissue concentrations for p,p'-DDE (p &lt; 0.001), p,p'-DDT (p &lt; 0.001), Cu (p &lt; 0.001), and Pb (p &lt; 0.01). Two neutral salt solutions, 0.01 M CaCl(2) and 1 M NH(4)NO(3), were used as surrogate measures of the bioavailability of heavy metals. Copper was the only heavy metal for which significant correlations were found between neutral-salt-extractable and earthworm tissue concentrations (p &lt; 0.001). Up to 28% of the aged DDT residues were released from the soils by Tenax over a 24-h extraction period. Significant relationships (p &lt; 0.01) between the Tenax-extractable and earthworm tissue concentrations for p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT showed that Tenax provides a good surrogate measure of the bioavailability of these compounds to A. caliginosa. Surprisingly, there was a similarly significant relationship (p &lt; 0.001) between the total soil and earthworm tissue concentrations for p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT, suggesting that total soil concentrations alone were sufficient to predict uptake by A. caliginosa. These results demonstrate that the aged agrichemical residues in orchard soils, and particularly p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT, remain highly bioavailable to A. caliginosa despite decades of weathering and continue to present an environmental risk.</str>

In the non-amended control, the average contents of microbial biomass C, N, and P were 1744, 193, and 63 microg g(-1) compost, respectively. On average, 1.3% of total P was stored as microbial biomass P. The addition of KH(2)PO(4) and TSP (triple super phosphate) led to immediate significant increases in microbial biomass C, N, and P.

      <str>The CF patients exhibited increased MRR and decreased MRPD during maximal respiratory effort, compared to controls. The differences in MRR-P(imax) and MRPD-P(Imax) between the controls and the complete group of CF patients were not significant. MRPD and MRR were significantly related to nutritional and pulmonary function impairment in CF patients. MRPD strongly correlated to maximal respiratory muscle pressures, and MRR strongly correlated to PTI(mus) in patients with CF. These findings suggest that CF patients are at increased risk of respiratory muscle fatigue. Regular determination of MRPD and MRR may be clinically useful in CF patients and help to initiate inspiratory muscle training and noninvasive ventilation.</str>

P. esocis La Rue, 1911 is apparently invalid but its conspecificity with either P. percae or P. longicollis could not be confirmed due to the absence of the scolex in the holotype and the unavailability of other material for morphological and molecular studies. P. osculatus (Goeze, 1782) has recently been transferred to Glanitaenia de Chambrier, Mariaux, Vaucher &amp; Zehnder, 2004. The validity of the genus is supported by the position of G. osculata within the Proteocephalidea, based on molecular data, as well as its morphology and nature of the definitive host (the European wels Silurus glanis). P. hemispherous Rahemo &amp; Al-Niaeemi, 2001, described from S. glanis in Iraq, is transferred to Postgangesia Akhmerov, 1960 as Postgangesia hemispherous (Rahemo &amp; Al-Niaeemi, 2001) n. comb.</str>

      <str>Optimizing phosphorus (P) utilization in pigs requires improving our capacity to predict the amount of P absorbed and retained, with the main modulating factors taken into account, as well as precisely determining the P requirements of the animals. Given the large amount of published data on P utilization in pigs, a meta-analysis was performed to quantify the impact of the different dietary P forms, calcium (Ca) and exogenous phytases on the digestive and metabolic utilization criteria for dietary P in growing pigs. Accordingly, the amount of phytate P (PP) leading to digestible P (g/kg) was estimated to be 21%, compared with 73% for non-phytate P (NPP) from plant ingredients and 80% for NPP from mineral and animal ingredients (P &lt; 0.001). The increase in total digestible dietary P following the addition of microbial phytase (PhytM) from Aspergillus niger (P &lt; 0.001) was curvilinear and about two times higher than the increase following the addition of plant phytase, which leads to a linear response (P &lt; 0.001). The response of digestible P to PhytM also depends on the amount of substrate, PP (PhytM(2) × PP, P &lt; 0.001). The digestibility of dietary P decreased with dietary Ca concentration (P &lt; 0.01) independently of phytase but increased with body weight (BW, P &lt; 0.05). Although total digestible dietary P increased linearly with total NPP concentration (P &lt; 0.001), retained P (g/kg), average daily gain (ADG, g/day) and average daily feed intake (ADFI, g/day) increased curvilinearly (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, whereas dietary Ca negatively affected P digestibility, the effect of dietary Ca on retained P, ADG and ADFI depended on total dietary NPP (NPP × Ca, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Increasing dietary Ca reduced retained P, ADG and ADFI at low NPP levels, but at higher NPP concentrations it had no effect on ADG and ADFI despite a positive effect on retained P. Although the curvilinear effect of PhytM on digestible P increased with PP (P &lt; 0.001), this effect was lessened by total NPP for ADG and ADFI (PhytM × NPP and PhytM(2) × NPP, P &lt; 0.05) and depended on both total NPP and Ca for retained P (PhytM(2) × NPP × Ca, P &lt; 0.01). This meta-analysis improves our understanding of P utilization, with major modulating factors taken into account. The information generated will be useful for the development of robust models to formulate environmentally friendly diets for growing pigs.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus in runoff from fields where poultry litter is surface-applied is an environmental concern. We investigated the effect of adding phytase and reducing supplemental P in poultry diets and composting poultry manures, with and without Fe and Al amendments, on P in manures, composts, and runoff. We used four diets: normal (no phytase) with 0.4% supplemental P, normal + phytase, phytase + 0.3% P, and phytase + 0.2% P. Adding phytase and decreasing supplemental P in diets reduced total P but increased water-extractable P in manure. Compared with manures, composting reduced both total P, due to dilution of manure with woodchips and straw, and water-extractable P, but beyond a dilution effect so that the ratio of water-extractable P to total P was less in compost than manure. Adding Fe and Al during composting did not consistently change total P or water-extractable P. Manures and composts were surface-applied to soil boxes at a rate of 50 kg total P ha(-1) and subjected to simulated rainfall, with runoff collected for 30 min. For manures, phytase and decreased P in diets had no significant effect on total P or molybdate-reactive P loads (kg ha(-1)) in runoff. Composting reduced total P and molybdate-reactive P loads in runoff, and adding Fe and Al to compost reduced total P but not molybdate-reactive P loads in runoff. Molybdate-reactive P in runoff (mg box(-1)) was well correlated to water-extractable P applied to boxes (mg box(-1)) in manures and composts. Therefore, the final environmental impact of dietary phytase will depend on the management of poultry diets, manure, and farm-scale P balances.</str>

      <str>The frequency of sensitization was as follows: rPhl p 1=93.5%; rPhl p 2=67.5%; rPhl p 5=72.7%; rPhl p 6=68.8%; rPhl p 7=7.8%; rPhl p 11=53.2%; rPhl p 12=35.1%; and native Phl p 4=88.3%. As expected, rPhl p 7 and rPhl p 12 had a very good correlation (Spearman's r) with Bet v 4 (r=0.95%, P&lt;0.05) and rBet v 2 (r=0.99, P&lt;0.05), respectively.

      <str>The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is composed of the large polymerase (L), the phosphoprotein (P), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the co-factors M2-1 and M2-2. The P protein plays a central role within the replicase-transcriptase machinery, forming homo-oligomers and complexes with N and L. In order to study P-P and N-P complexes, and the role of P phosphorylation in these interactions, the human RSV P and N proteins were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged or GST-fusion proteins. The non-phosphorylated status of recombinant P protein was established by mass spectrometry. GST-P and GST-N fusion proteins were able to interact with RSV proteins extracted from infected cells in a GST pull-down assay. When co-expressed in bacteria, GST-P and His-P were co-purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity, showing that the RSV P protein can form oligomers within bacteria. This result was confirmed by chemical cross-linking experiments and gel filtration studies. The P oligomerization domain was investigated by a GST pull-down assay using a series of P deletion constructs. This domain was mapped to a small region situated in the central part of P (aa 120-150), which localized in a computer-predicted coiled-coil domain. When co-expressed in bacteria, RSV N and P proteins formed a soluble complex that prevented non-specific binding of N to bacterial RNA. Therefore, RSV P protein phosphorylation is not required for the formation of P-P and N-P complexes, and P controls the RNA binding activity of N.</str>

      <str>An anaerobic incubation test was conducted to study the effects of different P application rate on the P concentrations in paddy soil and its surface water. The results showed that soil available P (Olsen-P) decreased rapidly at the beginning, but approached to stable after 60 days of P application. Both Olsen-P and residual P increased with increasing P application rate, and Olsen-P had a positive correlation with P application rate, suggesting that the test soil had a strong P adsorption capacity. After P application, the total P (TP) in soil surface water increased rapidly, and then decreased slowly, showing that there was a P exchange between soil and its surface water. After 120 days of P application, there was an exponential relationship between soil surface water TP and P application. The TP in soil surface water increased rapidly when the P application rate was 400 - 800 kg x hm (-2) , and easy to be lost when the P application rate was higher than 800 kg x hm(-2). The simulation with split line model on the relationship between soil Olsen-P and soil surface water TP showed that the change point of soil Olsen-P, which induced a sharp increase of soil surface water TP concentration, was 82. 7 mg x kg( -l) , corresponding to a P application rate being about 712 x kg hm(-2). Soil Olsen-P could be a good indicator in forecasting the P loss from soil surface water.</str>

      <str>L-Ascorbic acid (AA) and p-coumaric acid (p-CA) are naturally occurring antioxidants that are known to enhance collagen synthesis and inhibit melanin synthesis, respectively. The purpose of this study was to examine hybrid compounds between AA and p-CA as multifunctional cosmeceutical agents. Ascorbyl 3-p-coumarate (A-3-p-C), ascorbyl 2-p-coumarate (A-2-p-C), and their parent compounds were tested for their effects on cellular melanin synthesis and collagen synthesis. At 100 μM, A-3-p-C and A-2-p-C decreased melanin content of human dermal melanocytes stimulated by L-tyrosine, by 65 and 59 %, respectively, compared to 11 % inhibition of AA and 70 % inhibition of p-CA. A-3-p-C and A-2-p-C were less effective than p-CA but more effective than AA at inhibiting tyrosinase activity. A-3-p-C and A-2-p-C were more effective than p-CA at inhibiting the autoxidation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. At 100-300 μM, A-3-p-C and A-2-p-C augmented collagen release from human dermal fibroblasts by 120-144 % and 125-191 %, respectively, compared to 126-133 % increase of AA and 120-146 % increase of p-CA. They increased procollagen type I C-peptide release (A-3-p-C, and A-2-p-C) like AA, and decreased matrix metalloproteinase 1 level (A-2-p-C) like p-CA, implicating that they might regulate collagen metabolism by multiple mechanisms. This study suggests that A-3-p-C and A-2-p-C could be used as multifunctional cosmeceutical agents for the attenuation of certain aspects of skin aging. </str>

P(in), P(alb), P(dx 70), P(dx 150), P(dx 550), and P(dx 2, 000) were 0.51 +/- 0.06 (SE), 0.18 +/- 0.03, 0.097 +/- 0.021, 0. 047 +/- 0.011, 0.025 +/- 0.004, and 0.021 +/- 0.005 x 10(-5) cm/s, respectively. P(in), P(alb), and P(dx 70) of connective tissue, obtained after removal of mesothelium from specimens, were 10.3 +/- 1.42, 2.97 +/- 0.38, and 2.31 +/- 0.16 x 10(-5) cm/s, respectively. Hence, P(in), P(alb), and P(dx 70) of mesothelium were 0.54, 0.20, and 0.10 x 10(-5) cm/s, respectively. Inulin (like small solutes) fitted the relationship P-solute radius for restricted diffusion with a 6-nm "pore" radius, whereas macromolecules were much above it. Hence, macromolecule transfer mainly occurs through "large pores" and/or transcytosis. In line with this, the addition of phospholipids on the luminal side (which decreases pore radius to approximately 1.5 nm) halved P(in) but did not change P(alb) and P(dx 70). P(in) is roughly similar in mesothelium and capillary endothelium, whereas P to macromolecules is greater in mesothelium. The albumin diffusion coefficient through connective tissue was 17% of that in water. Mesothelium provides 92% of resistance to albumin diffusion through the pericardium.</str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to extensively analyze the signaling pathway molecules in breast cancer and to explore candidate biomarkers for clinicopathological relevance.</str>
      <str>We assessed the expression of key factors in cell signaling, namely p-AKT, cyclin D1, P27, p-p70S6 K, p-4EBP1, and p-MAPK/ERK, within 338 invasive breast cancer patients. These factors were immunohistochemically examined in tumor tissues and assessed by staining score. Staining scores were analyzed by a clustering method to devise a new classification based on pathway activity. We investigated the relationships among staining scores, the clustering classification, and patient characteristics.</str>
      <str>The proportion of patients displaying high expression levels were as follows: p-AKT, 75%; cyclin D1, 12%; P27, 53%; p-p70S6 K, 37%; p-4EBP1, 19%; and p-MAPK/ERK, 3%. Patients were classified into two groups on the basis of staining scores. Group 1 (39%) included more positive cases for p-4EBP1, p-MAPK/ERK, and p-p70S6 K and fewer positive cases for P27 and cyclin D1 than Group 2 (61%). The clustering classification was significantly related to subgrouping by hormone receptor and HER2 (P &lt; 0.001), nuclear grade (P &lt; 0.001) and histological subtype (P = 0.034). A strong positive correlation was identified between p-AKT and P27, cyclin D1 and P27, p-p70S6 K and p-4EBP1, p-p70S6 K and p-MAPK/ERK, and between p-4EBP1 and p-MAPK/ERK. Levels of p-p70S6 K were significantly related to recurrence in both univariate (RR = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001) and multivariate (RR = 0.71, P = 0.049) analyses.</str>
      <str>The present study helps us to understand the characteristics of signaling pathway status in breast cancers. Moreover, p-p70S6 K expression may be of use in predicting clinical outcome.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between distal ulnar morphology and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon pathology.</str>
      <str>We retrospectively reviewed 71 adult wrist MRI studies with ECU tendon pathology (tenosynovitis, tendinopathy, or tear), and/or ECU subluxation. Subjects did not have a history of trauma, surgery, infection, or inflammatory arthritis. MRI studies from 46 subjects without ECU tendon pathology or subluxation were used as controls. The following morphological parameters of the distal ulna were measured independently by two readers: ulnar variance relative to radius, ulnar styloid process length, ECU groove depth and length. Subjects and controls were compared using Student's t test. Inter-observer agreement (ICC) was calculated.</str>
      <str>There was a significant correlation between negative ulnar variance and ECU tendon pathology (reader 1 [R1], P = 0.01; reader 2 [R2], P &lt; 0.0001; R1 and R2 averaged data, P &lt; 0.0001) and ECU tendon subluxation (P = 0.001; P = 0.0001; P &lt; 0.0001). In subjects with ECU tendon subluxation there was also a trend toward a shorter length (P = 0.3; P &lt;0.0001; P = 0.001) and a shallower ECU groove (P = 0.01; P = 0.03; P = 0.01; R1 and R2 averaged data with Bonferroni correction, P = 0.08). ECU groove depth (P = 0.6; P = 0.8; P = 0.9) and groove length (P = 0.1; P = 0.4; P = 0.7) showed no significant correlation with ECU tendon pathology, and length of the ulnar styloid process showed no significant correlation with ECU tendon pathology (P = 0.2; P = 0.3; P = 0.2) or subluxation (P = 0.4; P = 0.5; P = 0.5).

      <str>It is well known that strain and virulence diversity exist within the population structure of Porphyromonas gingivalis. In the present study we investigate intra- and inter-species variability in biofilm formation of Porphyromonas gingivalis and partners Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. All strains tested showed similar hydrophobicity, except for P. gingivalis W83 which has roughly half of the hydrophobicity of P. gingivalis ATCC33277. An intraspecies variability in coaggregation of P. gingivalis with P. intermedia was also found. The association P. gingivalis W83/P. intermedia 17 produced the thickest biofilm and strain 17 was prevalent. In a two-compartment system P. gingivalis W83 stimulates an increase in biomass of strain 17 and the latter did not stimulate the growth of P. gingivalis W83. In addition, P. gingivalis W83 also stimulates the growth of P. intermedia ATCC25611 although strain W83 was prevalent in the association with P. intermedia ATCC25611. P. gingivalis ATCC33277 was prevalent in both associations with P. intermedia and both strains of P. intermedia stimulate the growth of P. gingivalis ATCC33277. FISH images also showed variability in biofilm structure. Thus, the outcome of the association P. gingivalis/P. intermedia seems to be strain-dependent, and both soluble factors and physical contact are relevant. The association P. gingivalis-P. nigrescens ATCC33563 produced larger biomass than each monotypic biofilm, and P. gingivalis was favored in consortia, while no differences were found in the two-compartment system. Therefore, in consortia P. gingivalis-P. nigrescens physical contact seems to favor P. gingivalis growth. The intraspecies variability found in our study suggests strain-dependence in ability of microorganisms to recognize molecules in other bacteria which may further elucidate the dysbiosis event during periodontitis development giving additional explanation for periodontal bacteria, such as P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, among others, to persist and establish chronic infections in the host. </str>

      <str>To investigate the differences in temporal bone development in various ear diseases--bilateral Meniere's disease (n = 13), unilateral Meniere's disease (n = 41), unilateral chronic otitis media (COM) (n = 25), temporal bone fracture (n = 9) and otosclerosis (n = 12)--the following 4 distances on a temporal bone CT slice encompassing the lateral semicircular canal (LSC) were measured by using the NIH Image program. These distances included the minimal distance between the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) and the posterior petrous surface (PPS) (P-P distance), the minimal distance between the PSC and the LSC (P-L distance), the minimal distance between the vestibule and the PPS (V-P distance) and the minimal distance between the PSC and the anterior margin of the sigmoid sinus (P-S distance). Both the P-P and V-P distances showed significant differences among the ear diseases, but the P-L and P-S distance did not. Meniere's disease showed significantly shorter P-P and V-P distance especially in bilateral Meniere's disease than those in COM and otosclerosis (p &lt; 0.05). Affected ears in unilateral Meniere's disease showed a shorter P-P distance than non-affected ears (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, both ears with otosclerosis showed significantly longer P-P and V-P distances than those in Meniere's disease, COM (p &lt; 0.01) and temporal bone fracture (p &lt; 0.05). COM and temporal bone fracture showed intermediate P-P and V-P distances, without a difference between the affected and non-affected ears. In conclusion, the development of the posterior part of the temporal bone is reduced in Meniere's disease and greatly increased in otosclerosis. These findings by CT may be useful for diagnosing ear diseases.</str>

      <str>In forest ecosystems with phosphorus (P) deficiency, the impact of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on nutritional traits related to P uptake and P use potentially determines plant growth and vegetation productivity.</str>
      <str>Two N deposition simulations were combined with three soil P conditions (homogeneous P deficiency with evenly low P; heterogeneous P deficiency with low subsoil P and high topsoil P; high P) using four full-sib families of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana). Under homogeneous P deficiency, N had a low effect on growth due to higher N:P ratios, whereas N-sensitive genotypes had lower N:P ratios and greater N sensitivity. The N effect increased under higher P conditions due to increased P concentration and balanced N:P ratios. An N:P threshold of 12.0-15.0 was detected, and growth was increased by N with an N:P ratio ≤ 12.0 and increased by P with an N:P ratio ≥ 15.0. Under homogeneous P deficiency, increased P use efficiency by N deposition improved growth. Under heterogeneous P deficiency, a greater P deficiency under N deposition due to increased N:P ratios induced greater adaptive responses to low P (root acid phosphatase secretion and topsoil root proliferation) and improved P acquisition and growth.</str>
      <str>N deposition diversely affected seedling growth across different P conditions and genotypes via N:P ratio effects and the modulation of adaptive responses to low P. The positive impact of N on growth was genotype-specific and increased by soil P addition due to balanced N:P ratios. These results indicate the significance of breeding N-sensitive tree genotypes and improving forest soil P status to compensate for increasing N deposition.</str>

      <str>Managing P on dairy farms requires the assessment and monitoring of P status of the animals so that potential overfeeding may be minimized. Numerous published studies have demonstrated that for lactating dairy cows, increasing P concentrations in diets led to greater P excretion in feces. More recent work reported that inorganic P (P(i)) in 0.1% HCl extracts of feces (fecal extract P(i), g/kg) closely reflects dietary P changes. This has led to the proposal that 0.1% HCl fecal extract P(i) may serve as an indicator of the animal's P status (adequate or excessive) when compared with a benchmark value. Here, we present the results of an extensive evaluation of the proposed fecal P indicator test. With samples (n=575) from &gt;90 farms, fecal total P (TP, g/kg) and fecal extract P were positively correlated with dietary P (X, g/kg): TP=1.92X - 0.17 (R2=0.36); fecal extract P=1.82X - 2.54 (R2=0.46). Fecal extract P was responsive to dietary P changes, whereas the remaining P, calculated as TP minus fecal extract P, was not. A provisional benchmark value of fecal extract P representing near-adequate P status was set at 4.75g/kg. Assessment of the farm data using the benchmark indicated that 316 out of 575 data points were associated with possible P overfeeding. Advantages of the fecal-based test over feed-based analysis to assess P status are discussed. The fecal extract P method is a simple and practical test that can be used as an assessment tool for helping dairy producers improve P management and reduce their environmental footprint.</str>

There existed greater differences in the P use efficiency for dry matter production at jointing stage (CV = 11.6%) and flowering stage (CV = 12.4%), and in the P use efficiency for grain yield at maturing stage (CV = 13.7%) among the genotypes. The biomass, P accumulation amount, and P use efficiency for dry matter production of high P use efficiency genotypes (IS-22-30 and IS-22-25) were significantly higher than those of low P use efficiency genotype (IS-07-07), and the grain yield of IS-22-30 and IS-22-25 was 3.10 and 3.20 times of that of IS-07-07, respectively. When supplied 0 and 30 mg x P kg(-1), the concentrations of available P and water soluble P in rhizosphere soils were significantly lower than those in non-rhizosphere soils, especially for the water soluble P. The concentrations of inorganic P fractions in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils were in the order of Ca10-P &gt; O-P &gt; Fe-P &gt; Al-P &gt; Ca2-P &gt; Ca8-P. When supplied 30 mg x P kg(-1), the Ca8-P concentration in high P use efficiency genotypes rhizosphere soils at jointing and flowering stages was significantly lower than that in low P use efficiency genotype rhizosphere soil, but the Ca2-P concentration was in adverse. When no P was supplied, the concentrations of Ca2-P and Ca8-P in high P use efficiency genotypes rhizosphere soils were significantly higher than those in low P use efficiency genotype rhizosphere soil, and the Ca10-P concentration in the rhizosphere soils of all genotypes decreased. When supplied 30 mg x P kg(-1), the Fe-P and O-P concentrations in high P use efficiency genotypes rhizosphere soils were significantly higher than that in low P use efficiency genotype rhizosphere soil, but the Al-P concentration presented an opposite trend. Under no P supply, the Al-P, Fe-P, and O-P concentrations in high P use efficiency genotypes rhizosphere soils were significantly lower than those in low P use efficiency genotype rhizosphere soil. It was suggested that under low P stress, the capabilities of high P use efficiency genotypes in activating and absorbing soil A1-P and Ca2-P were stronger than those of low P use efficiency genotype.</str>

      <str>Although much data have accumulated on sessile serrated adenoma/polyp/lesion (SSA/P/L) in general, its characteristics in specified contexts are less well elucidated. This lack of knowledge is even more conspicuous concerning its borderline counterpart, referred to as BSSA/P/L. The previous histological observations of the authors on SSA/P/L and BSSA/P/L in general are here extended to encompass attributes of these polyps in the context of synchronous colorectal carcinoma (SCRC), with a focus on the place of BSSA/P/L in the spectrum of non-dysplastic serrated polyps.</str>
      <str>219 SSA/P/Ls, 206 BSSA/P/Ls and 170 hyperplastic polyps (HPs) were examined for SCRC. Demographics, polyp details (size, site, BRAF((V600E))) and advanced synchronous conventional adenomas were recorded.</str>
      <str>SCRC was present in 12.3% of SSA/P/Ls, 7.1% of HPs (p=0.09) and 8.3% of BSSA/P/Ls. Patients' ages were comparable. Gender distribution of SSA/P/L and BSSA/P/L was equal, which differed, albeit insignificantly, from a male predominance of HPs. More SSA/P/Ls and BSSA/P/Ls than HPs exceeded 4 mm (p≤0.0001). A proximal site characterised SSA/P/L compared with BBSA/P/L and HP (p&lt;0.0001). BRAF mutation was more prevalent in SSA/P/Ls and BSSA/P/Ls, which further coexisted with advanced synchronous conventional adenomas less commonly than HPs.</str>
      <str>BSSA/P/L was like SSA/P/L in most respects. The lower SCRC prevalence of BSSA/P/L could fit the idea of BSSA/P/L as a precursor to SSA/P/L, a notion that deserves attention when formulating guidelines for CRC screening.</str>

      <str>Maternal oxidative stress during pregnancy may impair fetal growth and help in the development of diseases in adulthood. The aim of current study was to assess total oxidation status (TOS), related parameters and their relationship to DNA damage (%) and homocysteine level in normal pregnant women in low-income participants. In a cross-sectional study healthy women were grouped as normal, while age matched nulliparous and singleton pregnancies were included for first, second and third trimester groups. TOS (P&lt;0.01), melanodialdehyde (MDA) (P&lt;0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P&lt;0.01), triiodothyronine (T3) (P&lt;0.01), thyroxine (T4) (P&lt;0.01), and homocysteine (P&lt;0.001), in pregnant women were significantly higher as compared to normal healthy women. While serum total proteins (P&lt;0.01), albumin (P&lt;0.01) and total antioxidant status (TAS) (P&lt;0.001) decreased significantly as compared to normal healthy women. Women in third trimester showed a significantly high level of body temperature (P&lt;0.01), triglyceride (P&lt;0.01), LDL-cholesterol (P&lt;0.05), AST (P&lt;0.01), T3 (P&lt;0.01), homocysteine (P&lt;0.001), TOS (P&lt;0.01) and MDA (P&lt;0.001) but a lower concentration of serum proteins, albumin and TAS at the end of the pregnancy. Pearson correlation indicated a positive relationship of homocysteine with triglycerides (P&lt;0.027), TOS (P&lt;0.01), MDA (P&lt;0.035) and had a negative relationship with total protein (P&lt;0.026). DNA damage was strongly related with T3 (P&lt;0.008), TOS (P&lt;0.02), MDA (P&lt;0.037) and MBI (P&lt;0.048) profiles of pregnant women. These changes were considered normal for pregnant women having optimum blood pressure and normal child birth. Hormonal influences and hemodilution may contribute towards the observed changes in this study.</str>

      <str>As an important pathway for phosphorus (P) transport from soil to water body, P leaching has aroused attention. This study aimed to investigate the degree of risk and forms of P leaching from P-enriched soils. Surface soils were collected from forest land (FL) and open agricultural land (OAL) in typical P-enriched area of the Dianchi catchment, China. Based on analysis of soil P and water-soluble P using chemical methods and (31)P-NMR analysis, combined with a soil column leaching experiment, P forms and risk of P leaching were identified. CaCl2-extractable water-soluble organic P (CaCl2-Po), inorganic P (CaCl2-Pi), and total P (CaCl2-P) extracted using 0.01-M CaCl2 solution were found to be useful for predicting potential organic and inorganic P leaching, given a linear, positive correlation between CaCl2-P, CaCl2-Pi, and CaCl2-Po in soils and accumulated amounts of corresponding P forms in soil leachates. The majority of investigated FL was at or above the change points of 46, 46, and 42 mg AP kg(-1) for CaCl2-Pi, CaCl2-Po, and CaCl2-P, respectively, and thus at a risk of P leaching. Organic and inorganic P leaching was present in nearly all investigated OAL. CaCl2-Po accounted for 66.0 % of CaCl2-P in FL and 56.1 % in OAL. Signals of (31)P-NMR spectra were mainly attributable to orthophosphate, orthophosphate monoesters, and orthophosphate diesters in FL and OAL soils. It is important to consider P loss due to leaching of inorganic and organic P in P-enriched areas. </str>

      <str>The non-invasive leaf patch clamp pressure (LPCP) probe measures the attenuated pressure of a leaf patch, P(p) , in response to an externally applied magnetic force. P(p)  is inversely coupled with leaf turgor pressure, P(c) , i.e. at high P(c)  values the P(p)  values are small and at low P(c)  values the P(p)  values are high. This relationship between P(c)  and P(p)  could also be verified for 2-m tall olive trees under laboratory conditions using the cell turgor pressure probe. When the laboratory plants were subjected to severe water stress (P(c)  dropped below ca. 50 kPa), P(p)  curves show reverse diurnal changes, i.e. during the light regime (high transpiration) a minimum P(p)  value, and during darkness a peak P(p)  value is recorded. This reversal of the P(p)  curves was completely reversible. Upon watering, the original diurnal P(p)  changes were re-established within 2-3 days. Olive trees in the field showed a similar turnover of the shape of the P(p)  curves upon drought, despite pronounced fluctuations in microclimate. The reversal of the P(p)  curves is most likely due to accumulation of air in the leaves. This assumption was supported with cross-sections through leaves subjected to prolonged drought. In contrast to well-watered leaves, microscopic inspection of leaves exhibiting inverse diurnal P(p)  curves revealed large air-filled areas in parenchyma tissue. Significantly larger amounts of air could also be extracted from water-stressed leaves than from well-watered leaves using the cell turgor pressure probe. Furthermore, theoretical analysis of the experimental P(p)  curves shows that the propagation of pressure through the nearly turgorless leaf must be exclusively dictated by air. Equations are derived that provide valuable information about the water status of olive leaves close to zero P(c) .</str>

      <str>P wave dispersion (P(d)), defined as the difference between the maximum (P(max)) and the minimum P wave duration (P(min)), and P(max) are electrocardiographic (ECG) markers that have been used to evaluate the discontinuous propagation of sinus impulses and the prolongation of atrial conduction time. P(d) in normal subjects has been reported to be influenced by the autonomic tone, which induces changes in atrial size and the velocity of impulse propagation. However, the association between P(d) and anxiety has not been studied in normal subjects.</str>
      <str>P(max), P(min) and P(d) were measured in 726 physically and mentally healthy young male volunteers, aged 21.23 +/- 1.25 years (range 20-26). The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was scored concomitantly. Blinded intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the P wave duration and P(d) measurement were evaluated, and comparison revealed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 and 0.89 for the P wave duration, and 0.93 and 0.90 for P(d), respectively (p &lt; 0.001). P(max) and P(d) were significantly correlated with the state anxiety (STAI-1) subscale (r = 0.662, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.540, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and the trait anxiety (STAI-2) subscale (r = 0.583, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.479, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). P(min) did not show any significant correlation with anxiety. Across 3 variables included in a multiple linear regression analysis, STAI-1 and STAI-2 were the significant independent determinants of P(max) and P(d). Beta coefficients indicated that the contribution of STAI-1 to P(max) (66.3 and 33.7%) and P(d) (65 and 35%) was much greater than that of STAI-2.</str>
      <str>STAI-1 and STAI-2 are associated with an increase in P(max) and P(d). The association of P(d) resulted from an augmentation of P(max). This is the first study to show the relation between P(max), P(d) and anxiety.</str>

      <str>A new series of proximal,proximal-[Ru2(tpy)2(L)XY](n+) (p,p-Ru2XY, tpy = 2,2':6',2″-terpyridine, L = 5-phenyl-2,8-di(2-pyridyl)-1,9,10-anthyridine, X and Y = other coordination sites) were synthesized using photoisomerization of a mononuclear complex. The p,p-Ru2XY complexes undergo unusual reversible bridge-exchange reactions to generate p,p-Ru2(μ-Cl), p,p-Ru2(μ-OH), and p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) with μ-Cl, μ-OH, as well as hydroxo and aquo ligands at X and Y sites of p,p-Ru2XY, respectively. The geometric and electronic structures of these complexes were characterized based on UV-vis and (1)H NMR spectra, X-ray crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. (1)H NMR data showed C2 symmetry of p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) with the distorted L chelate and nonequivalence of two tpy ligands, in contrast to the C2v symmetry of p,p-Ru2(μ-Cl) and p,p-Ru2(μ-OH). However, irrespective of the lower symmetry, p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) is predominantly formed in neutral and weakly basic conditions due to the specially stabilized core structure by multiple hydrogen-bond interactions among aquo, hydroxo, and backbone L ligands. The electrochemical data suggested that p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) (Ru(II)-OH:Ru(II)-OH2) is oxidized to the Ru(III)-OH:Ru(III)-OH state at 0.64 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and further to Ru(IV)═O:Ru(IV)-OH at 0.79 V by successive 1-proton-coupled 2-electron processes at pH 7.0. The cyclic voltammogram data exhibited that the p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) complex works more efficiently for electrocatalytic water oxidation, compared with a similar mononuclear complex distal-[Ru(tpy)(L)OH2](2+) (d-RuOH2) and p,p-Ru2(μ-Cl) and p,p-Ru2(μ-OH), showing that the p,p-Ru2 core structure with aquo and hydroxo ligands is important for efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation. Bulk electrolysis of the p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) solution corroborated the electrocatalytic cycle involving the Ru(III)-OH:Ru(III)-OH state species as a resting state. The mechanistic insight into O-O bond formation for O2 production was provided by the isotope effect on electrocatalytic water oxidation by p,p-Ru2(OH)(OH2) and d-RuOH2 in H2O and D2O media. </str>

      <str>Both intrinsic and exogenous phytase in poultry feeds can alter phytate utilization and the solubility of P excreted. This experiment determined the effects of feeding diets varying in cereal grain, P concentration and phytase addition on phytate and P utilization and P characterization of ileal digesta and excreta. Twelve treatments, consisting of diets based on corn, wheat, barley, or high fat-low lignin oat and 3 P treatments (low P with 0.30% nonphytate P; low P + 1,000 phytase units of phytase; high P with 0.45% nonphytate P), were fed to 300 broilers using a factorial design. Fresh excreta were collected at 20 and 21 d and ileal digesta was collected at 21 d. Ileal digesta and excreta were analyzed for total P, phytate P and Ca, with P composition determined by solution (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Excreta samples were also analyzed for water soluble P (WSP). Apparent ileal digestibility coefficients for phytate P and total P ranged from 0.03 to 0.42 and 0.56 to 0.71, respectively. Diets supplemented with phytase had greater phytate P hydrolysis than unsupplemented diets. Apparent total tract digestibility coefficients for phytate P and total P ranged from 0.10 to 0.73 and 0.43 to 0.61, respectively. Across cereal grains, there was almost a 3-fold increase in total tract phytate P hydrolysis with phytase supplementation. The P composition of ileal digesta was predominantly phytate P (70 to 88% of total P), whereas excreta phytate P ranged from 26 to 76% of total P. Excreta WSP ranged from 3.2 to 7.5 g kg(-1) and was least for the barley diets. There was a 25% reduction in excreta WSP from the high P to the low P + phytase diets and a 37% reduction from the high P to the low P diets. As cereal grain had little influence on phytate digestibility, it is unlikely that intrinsic phytase in grain has much influence on phytate utilization by poultry. Both total P and WSP in excreta were reduced by the low P diet and the low P + phytase diet, irrespective of cereal grain, which reduces the risk of P transfer to water bodies when excreta are applied to land as fertilizer.</str>

      <str>Adequate plasma volume (PV) and extracellular fluid (ECF) volume are essential for blood pressure and fluid regulation. We tested the hypotheses that combined progesterone (P(4))-estrogen (E(2)) administration would increase ECF volume with proportional increases in PV, but that P(4) would have little independent effect on either PV or ECF volume. We further hypothesized that this P(4)-E(2)-induced fluid expansion would be a function of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulation. We suppressed P(4) and E(2) with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist in eight women (25 +/- 2 yr) for 16 days; P(4) (200 mg/day) was added for days 5-16 (P(4)) and 17beta-estradiol (2 x 0.1 mg/day patches) for days 13-16 (P(4)-E(2)). On days 2 (GnRH antagonist), 9 (P(4)), and 16 (P(4)-E(2)), we estimated ECF and PV. To determine the rate of protein and thus water movement across the ECF, we also measured transcapillary escape rate of albumin. In P(4), P([P(4)]) increased from 2.5 +/- 1.3 to 12.0 +/- 2.8 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.05) with no change in P([E(2)]) (21.5 +/- 9.4 to 8.6 +/- 2.0 pg/ml). In P(4)-E(2), plasma concentration of P(4) remained elevated (11.3 +/- 2.7 ng/ml) and plasma concentration of E(2) increased to 254.1 +/- 52.7 pg/ml (P &lt; 0.05). PV increased during P(4) (46.6 +/- 2.5 ml/kg) and P(4)-E(2) (48.4 +/- 3.9 ml/kg) compared with GnRH antagonist (43.3 +/- 3.2 ml/kg; P &lt; 0.05), as did ECF (206 +/- 19, 244 +/- 25, and 239 +/- 27 ml/kg for GnRH antagonist, P(4), and P(4)-E(2), respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Transcapillary escape rate of albumin was lowest during P(4)-E(2) (5.8 +/- 1.3, 3.5 +/- 1.7, and 2.2 +/- 0.4%/h for GnRH antagonist, P(4), and P(4)-E(2), respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Serum aldosterone increased during P(4) and P(4)-E(2) compared with GnRH antagonist (79 +/- 17, 127 +/- 13, and 171 +/- 25 pg/ml for GnRH antagonist, P(4), and P(4)-E(2), respectively; P &lt; 0.05), but plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of ANG II were only increased by P(4)-E(2). This study is the first to isolate P(4) effects on ECF; however, the mechanisms for the ECF and PV expansion have not been clearly defined.</str>

      <str>P-450-male is a male specific form of cytochrome P-450 in rat liver microsomes. Cytochrome P-450 crossreactive with anti-P-450-male antibodies was purified to an electrophoretical homogeneity from liver microsomes of male beagle dogs. The specific content of the purified cytochrome P-450 (P-450-D1) was 16.9 nmol/mg protein. The apparent monomeric molecular weight of P-450-D1 was 48,000, which was smaller than P-450-male (51,000). P-450-D1 showed similarities in spectral properties, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and catalytic activities with some limited exceptions: P-450-D1 did not catalyze 2 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone and progesterone and catalyzed 21-hydroxylation of progesterone. Based on these results, we propose that P-450-D1 is a form of cytochrome P-450 in the same gene subfamily as P-450-male.</str>

P-450id and P-450ie showed apparent molecular weights of 50 and 49 kDa, respectively, on SDS-PAGE. Both P-450s catalyzed N-demethylation of nitrosodimethylamine. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (first 19 residues) of P-450id exhibited 74-90% identity with those of six members of the rabbit P-450 2C subfamily, except for P-450 2C3. Similarly, the NH2-terminal sequence (first 22 residues) of P-450ie showed 73-86% identity with those of the same members of the rabbit P-450 2C subfamily. The peptide mapping patterns of the two P-450s were quite different from each other. In addition, P-450id did not cross-react with the guinea-pig antibodies against P-450ie.

      <str>Unsaturated cobalamin-binding capacity in plasma (P-UBBC) is determined by use of a silica gel (QUSO G32) to separate haptocorrin (P-ApoHC) and transcobalamin (P-ApoTC). The method is sensitive and precise: detection limit 13 pmol/L, interassay coefficients of variation 3% for P-UBBC (mean = 1080 pmol/L), 4% for P-ApoTC (mean = 700 pmol/L) (n = 30). Values for P-UBBC, P-ApoHC, P-ApoTC, and P-TBBC (P-UBBC plus P-cobalamin) determined in a population study of 228 individuals, ages 21-87 years, did not differ by sex. These values increased with age, whereas the cobalamin saturation (P-cobalamin as percentage of P-TBBC) decreased with age. However, these changes were statistically significant but marginal and thus not clinically important. We therefore suggest using combined reference intervals (central 95 percentiles) for all age groups: 500-1200 pmol/L for P-UBBC, 90-275 pmol/L for P-ApoHC, 400-930 pmol/L for P-ApoTC, 850-1600 pmol/L for P-TBBC, and 20-50% for cobalamin saturation.

      <str>Immunochemical properties of P-450HFLb purified from human fetal livers were investigated. P-450HFLb cross-reacted with antibodies to rat P-4501A1 but not with antibodies to CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP3A7 (P-450HFLa) and rat CYP2B1. In addition, P-450HFLb also cross-reacted with both monospecific antibodies to rat CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. However, P-450HFLb was shown to be an immunochemically distinct form of cytochrome P-450 from P-450PA (human CYP1A2). Immunoblot analysis of human fetal livers with the antibodies to P-450HFLb showed that P-450HFLb was expressed in all fetal livers studied although there appeared to be individual differences in the amounts of P-450HFLb expressed in fetal livers. The formation of mutagens from IQ (but not from AFB1) in fetal liver homogenates was inhibited by the antibodies to P-450HFLb in a dose dependent manner. These results suggest that P-450HFLb may be a form of human cytochrome P-450 classified into CYP1 gene family, and that the cytochrome P-450 is, in part, responsible for the mutagenic activation of IQ in human fetal livers as well as CYP3A7 (P-450HFLa).</str>

Eight healthy young subjects were studied during a ramp exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Arterial samples were drawn at rest and every minute during the exercise test for determination of P(a)CO2 . P(a)CO2 was compared with indirect estimates of P(CO2) : P(M)(CO2), end-tidal P(CO2) (P(ET)(CO2)) and an empirical equation involving P(ET)(CO2) and tidal volume (P(J)(CO2)). The difference between estimated and measured P(a)CO2 on the whole ramp exercise was -0.3+/-1.9mmHg for P(M)(CO2), 1.0+/-2.2mmHg for P(ET)(CO2) and -1.7+/-1.7mmHg for P(J)(CO2) . P(ET)(CO2) and P(J)(CO2) were significantly different from actual P(a)CO2 (P&lt;0.001).

      <str>One,1-dichloro-2,2 bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the major metabolite of 2,2-bis(4-Chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT), is a known persistent organic pollutant and male reproductive toxicant. It has antiandrogenic effect. However, the mechanism by which p,p'-DDE exposure causes male reproductive toxicity remains unknown. In the present study, rat Sertoli cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism involved in p,p'-DDE-induced toxicity in male reproductive system. The results indicated that p,p'-DDE exposure at over 30 muM showed the induction of apoptotic cell death. p,p'-DDE could induce increases in FasL mRNA and protein, which could be blocked by an antioxidant agent, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). In addition, caspase-3 and -8 were activated by p,p'-DDE treatment in these cells. The activation of NF-kappaB was enhanced with the increase of p,p'-DDE dose. Taken together, these results suggested that exposure to p,p'-DDE might induce apoptosis of rat Sertoli cells through a FasL-dependent pathway.</str>

      <str>An advanced non-invasive, field-suitable and inexpensive leaf patch clamp pressure probe for online-monitoring of the water relations of intact leaves is described. The probe measures the attenuated output patch clamp pressure, P(p), of a clamped leaf in response to an externally applied input pressure, P(clamp). P(clamp) is generated magnetically. P(p) is sensed by a pressure sensor integrated into the magnetic clamp. The magnitude of P(p) depends on the transfer function, T(f), of the leaf cells. T(f) consists of a turgor pressure-independent (related to the compression of the cuticle, cell walls and other structural elements) and a turgor pressure-dependent term. T(f) is dimensionless and assumes values between 0 and 1. Theory shows that T(f) is a power function of cell turgor pressure P(c). Concomitant P(p) and P(c) measurements on grapevines confirmed the relationship between T(f) and P(c). P(p) peaked if P(c) approached zero and assumed low values if P(c) reached maximum values. The novel probe was successfully tested on leaves of irrigated and non-irrigated grapevines under field conditions. Data show that slight changes in the microclimate and/or water supply (by irrigation or rain) are reflected very sensitively in P(p).</str>

      <str>We examined variation in and around the region coding for the cytochrome c oxidase I (coxI) and ATPase 6 (atp6) genes in the mitochondrial genomes of four Populus species (P. nigra, P. deltoides, P. maximowiczii, and P. tremuloides) and the natural hybrid P. x canadensis (P. deltoides x P. nigra). Total cellular DNAs of these poplars were digested with 16 restriction endonucleases and probed with maize mtDNA-specific probes (CoxI and Atp6). The only variant observed for Atp6 was interspecific, with P. maximowiczii separated from the other species as revealed by EcoRI digestions. No intraspecific mtDNA variation was observed among individuals of P. nigra, P. maximowiczii, P. x canadensis, or P. tremuloides for the CoxI probe. However, two varieties of P. deltoides were distinct because of a single site change in the KpnI digestions, demonstrating that P. deltoides var. deltoides (eastern cottonwood) and var. occidentalis (plains cottonwood) have distinct mitochondrial genomes in the region of the coxI gene. Populus x canadensis shared the same restriction fragment patterns as its suspected maternal parent P. deltoides. Nucleotide substitutions per base in and around the coxI and atp6 genes among the Populus species and the hybrid ranged from 0.0017 to 0.0077. The interspecific estimates of nucleotide substitution per base suggested that P. tremuloides was furthest removed from P. deltoides and P. x canadensis and least diverged from P. nigra. Populus maximowiczii was placed between these two clusters.</str>

      <str>Genotypic variations in the adaptive response to low-phosphorus (P) stress and P-uptake efficiency have been widely reported in many crops. We conducted a pot experiment to evaluate the P-acquisition ability of two rapeseed (Brassica napus) genotypes supplied with two sparingly soluble sources of P, Al-P and Fe-P. Then, the root morphology, proton concentrations, and carboxylate content were investigated in a solution experiment to examine the genotypic difference in P-acquisition efficiency. Both genotypes produced greater biomass and accumulated more P when supplied with Al-P than when supplied with Fe-P. The P-efficient genotype 102 showed a significantly greater ability to deplete sparingly soluble P from the rhizosphere soil because of its greater biomass and higher P uptake compared with those of the P-inefficient genotype 105. In the solution experiment, the P-efficient genotype under low-P conditions developed dominant root morphological traits, and it showed more intensive rhizosphere acidification because of greater H(+) efflux, higher H(+)-ATPase activity, and greater exudation of carboxylates than the P-inefficient genotype. Thus, a combination of morphological and physiological mechanisms contributed to the genotypic variation in the utilization of different sparingly soluble P sources in B. napus.</str>

Cyclic voltammetry with a goldren electrode of p-AP solutions in phosphate buffers at pH 7.30 showed that standard electrode potential of half reaction for (p-Q) and (p-AP) is 0.728V. Standard electrode potential of half reaction for p-Q and p-AP were calculated using the sum of electronic and thermal free energies of p-Q and p-AP with normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) as a reference electrode. The results show that the theoretical standard electrode potential of half reaction for p-Q and p-AP is 0.682V at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level and 0.622V at HF/6-31G(d,p) level, respectively, indicating that computed standard electrode potential at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level are more reliable than that at HF/6-31G(d,p) level.</str>

      <str>P strains of Drosophila are distinguished from M strains by having P elements in their genomes and also by having the P cytotype, a maternally inherited condition that strongly represses P-element-induced hybrid dysgenesis. The P cytotype is associated with P elements inserted near the left telomere of the X chromosome. Repression by the telomeric P elements TP5 and TP6 is significantly enhanced when these elements are crossed into M' strains, which, like P strains, carry P elements, but have little or no ability to repress dysgenesis. The telomeric and M' P elements must coexist in females for this enhanced repression ability to develop. However, once established, it is transmitted maternally to the immediate offspring independently of the telomeric P elements themselves. Females that carry a telomeric P element but that do not carry M' P elements may also transmit an ability to repress dysgenesis to their offspring independently of the telomeric P element. Cytotype regulation therefore involves a maternally transmissible product of telomeric P elements that can interact synergistically with products from paternally inherited M' P elements. This synergism between TP and M' P elements also appears to persist for at least one generation after the TP has been removed from the genotype.</str>

      <str>Genetic distances among strains of P. sexaurelia were compared by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The relationships of P. sexaurelia with representative strains of other species of the P. aurelia complex and related species, i.e., P. schewiakoffi, P. jenningsi and P. multimicronucleatum were evaluated. All investigated P. sexaurelia and P. dodecaurelia strains grouped together with high support. This P. sexaurelia/P. dodecaurelia cluster was furthermore composed of three distinct, strongly supported subgroups. Two of these groups contained both P. sexaurelia and P. dodecaurelia strains, suggesting that these species are not monophyletic. The third branch was composed of strains from Sevilla, Spain and was deeply separated (12-14% p-distance) from the other P. sexaurelia/P. dodecaurelia clades. This illustrates the urgent need for further work and more intense sampling of these "rare" species, in order to understand the status and the relationships of P. sexaurelia and P. dodecaurelia within the P. aurelia species complex. We recommend that general investigations on the speciation process be conducted within and between species of the P. aurelia complex due to the high genetic variation combined with observations that for some of the species possible cryptic speciation may have occurred. This is emphasized by data showing that for some species within this complex, species status may be less static and more dynamic than originally thought.</str>

      <str>Species classified in Penicillium sect. Chrysogena are primary soil-borne and the most well-known members are P. chrysogenum and P. nalgiovense. Penicillium chrysogenum has received much attention because of its role in the production on penicillin and as a contaminant of indoor environments and various food and feedstuffs. Another biotechnologically important species is P. nalgiovense, which is used as a fungal starter culture for the production of fermented meat products. Previous taxonomic studies often had conflicting species circumscriptions. Here, we present a multigene analysis, combined with phenotypic characters and extrolite data, demonstrating that sect. Chrysogena consists of 18 species. Six of these are newly described here (P. allii-sativi, P. desertorum, P. goetzii, P. halotolerans, P. tardochrysogenum, P. vanluykii) and P. lanoscoeruleum was found to be an older name for P. aethiopicum. Each species produces a unique extrolite profile. The species share phenotypic characters, such as good growth on CYA supplemented with 5 % NaCl, ter- or quarterverticillate branched conidiophores and short, ampulliform phialides (&lt; 9 μm). Conidial colours, production of ascomata and ascospores, shape and ornamentation of conidia and growth rates on other agar media are valuable for species identification. Eight species (P. allii-sativi, P. chrysogenum, P. dipodomyis, P. flavigenum, P. nalgiovense, P. rubens, P. tardochrysogenum and P. vanluykii) produce penicillin in culture.</str>

The overall mean of p,p'-DDE concentration was 1.66 microg/g of fatty acids (95% confidence interval = 1.46, 1.88). In a multiple-regression analysis, the main predictors of log10(p,p'DDE) were center of recruitment (p &lt; .0001), adipose arachidic acid (p = .001), and adipose retinol (p = .04). These factors explained 14.9% of the overall variability of log10(p,p'-DDE). In our subjects, adipose tissue p,p'DDE concentrations were only weakly related with biomarkers reflecting intake of fish and other foods. This result is consistent with the notion that p,p'-DDE exists in different foods and, given the widespread contamination of the food chain, is relatively evenly distributed among foods.</str>

In this study we have shown that ACTH does not greatly affect the half-life of mRNAs encoding P-450(11)beta, P-450(17)alpha, P-450C21 and adrenodoxin. However, in the case of P-450SCC mRNA, ACTH causes a five-fold increase in the half-life leading to a significant stabilization of P-450SCC mRNA. Thus it appears that the levels of mRNAs encoding P-450(11)beta, P-450(17)alpha, P-450C21 and adrenodoxin are regulated by ACTH primarily at the transcriptional level, while that for P-450SCC is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</str>

The mean P(aa) given by the dual-culture assay was within a 40% range of that given by the batch approach. The P(aa) obtained by both bioassays differed from total P. Dissolved reactive P appeared to be the most readily available chemical P fraction, but other P fractions also contributed to P(aa). The analysis of reactive P, which involves direct staining of an unfiltered sample, best approximated the P(aa) given by the dual-culture assay (relative error 9%). The results suggest that assessment of eutrophying effluent P can be improved by analysing simple chemical P fractions in wastewater.

Five phosphorus speciations including loosely bound P (ex-P), reductant soluble P (BD-P), metal oxide-bound P (NaOH-P) calcium-bound P (HCl-P) and residual-P were extracted and quantified. Results showed that in Manwan Reservoir HCl-P accounted for the largest part of total phosphorus (TP) (49.69%), while in Xiaowan and Dachaoshan reservoirs, NaOH-P was the most abundant speciation which accounted for 57.21% and 55.19% of total phosphorus respectively. Higher contents of bio-available phosphorus in Xiaowan and Dachaoshan reservoirs suggested a high rate of P releasing from sediments. Results also showed ex-P and HCl-P had positive correlation with Ca. Total phosphorus was positively correlated with Fe.

      <str>Rates of P influx and efflux were determined in whole plants at ambient P concentrations comparable to those found in soil solutions. Maize (Zea mays L. var NC+59) seedlings were trimmed (endosperm and adventitious roots removed) and grown in a greenhouse in solution cultures at P concentrations of approximately 0.4 and 1.8 micromolar. Roots of intact plants previously exposed to (32)P-labeled solutions at 0.2 and 2.0 micromolar P for 48 hours were rinsed 10 minutes in P-free solution and exposed to (33)P solutions at 0.2 and 2.0 micromolar for 10 minutes. Net depletion of (33)P from and appearance of (32)P in the ambient solution were used to measure influx and efflux. The ration of (32)P efflux to (33)P influx was about 0.68 at 0.2 micromolar and 0.08 at 2.0 micromolar. When plants were allowed to deplete P from solutions, the P concentration in the medium dropped to about 0.15 micromolar within 24 hours and 0.05 micromolar within 60 hours. Results indicate that P efflux is a substantial component of net P accumulation at P concentrations normally found in soil solutions.</str>

      <str>The Jun family and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) are involved in proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, c-Jun and STAT3 cooperate to regulate apoptosis. Therefore, we used double immunostaining to investigate the immunotopographical distribution of phospho-c-Jun (p-c-Jun), JunB, JunD, p-STAT3, p-STAT5, and p-STAT6 in human thymus. JunD was frequently expressed by thymocytes with higher expression in medullary compared to cortical thymocytes. p-c-Jun was frequently expressed by cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells (TEC) and Hassall bodies (HB). p-STAT3 was frequently expressed by TEC with higher expression in cortical compared to medullary TEC and HB. p-c-Jun, JunB, p-STAT3, p-STAT5, and p-STAT6 were rarely expressed by thymocytes. JunB and JunD were expressed by rare cortical TEC with higher expression in medullary TEC. p-STAT5 and p-STAT6 were expressed by rare cortical and medullary TEC. Double immunostaining revealed p-c-Jun and JunD expression in rare CD11c positive dendritic cells. Our findings suggest a notable implication of JunD in the physiology of thymocytes and p-c-Jun and p-STAT3 in the physiology of TEC. The diversity of the immunotopographical distribution and the expression levels of p-c-Jun, JunB, JunD, p-STAT3, p-STAT5, and p-STAT6 indicates that they are differentially involved in the differentiation of TEC, thymocytes, and dendritic cells. </str>

      <str>Patients with pancreatic cancer who present with biliary symptoms may undergo cholecystectomy and thus delay cancer diagnosis. We hypothesized that prior cholecystectomy leads to decreased overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</str>

      <str>Three hundred sixty-five patients with a diagnosis of resectable periampullary pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Eighty-seven patients underwent prior cholecystectomy. Median age (P = .48), body mass index (BMI) (P = .8), diabetes status (P = .06), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class (P = .22), stent placement (P = .13), operative time (P = .76), estimated blood loss (EBL) (P = .24), intraoperative transfusion (P = .91), portal vein resection (P = .25), LOS (P = .09) adjuvant therapy (P = .2), tumor size (P = .89), differentiation (P = .67), angiolymphatic invasion (P = .69), perineural invasion (P = 54), nodal metastasis (P = .43), complication rate (P = .75), and 30-day mortality (P = .58) were not statistically different between patients with previous cholecystectomy and those without. Median survival was 14 months for patients with a history of cholecystectomy and 16 months for those without (P = .25). Previous cholecystectomy was not a predictor of survival on Cox regression analysis.</str>

      <str>Antisera were raised in rabbits to human properdin in the precursor form (P) and in the activated state (P). On Ouchterlony analysis using the anti-P, reactions of complete identity were obtained between P, P, and properdin in twofold concentrated serum (NHS). However, when anti-P was used, a reaction of identity was obtained only between P and NHS, and a reaction of partial identity was formed between P and P and between properdin in NHS and P, suggestive of the fact that certain antigenic determinants in P may be lacking in P. The results indicate that activation of precursor properdin may involve proteolytic cleavage and/or conformational alterations of the molecule.</str>

      <str>The occurrence of cytochrome P-450(14DM) (lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase) and cytochrome P-450alk (long-chain alkane terminal hydroxylase) in various yeast strains was determined with immunological procedures. Cytochrome P-450(14DM), which is constitutive or housekeeping enzyme playing an essential role in ergosterol biogenesis, was found in all yeast strains so far tested. Cytochromes P-450(14DM) from different species of yeast were immunologically different, although they may have had a few common antigenic sites. In contrast, cytochrome P-450alk was detected only in the alkane-assimilating yeasts.</str>

      <str>We have made extracellular recordings from locus coeruleus neurones contained in a pontine slice preparation. The in vitro technique permits application of known concentrations of drugs in the perfusion medium. Substance P excites locus coeruleus neurones in a concentration-dependent manner. The activity of substance P was found to reside in the C terminal region of the molecule. The relative potency of substance P and related peptides suggests that the substance P receptors present within the locus coeruleus are predominately of the substance P-P type. The synthetic analogue [D-Pro2,D-Trp7.9]substance P was not found to antagonise the action of substance P on locus coeruleus neurones.</str>

In Experiment 1, we compared the high-p sequence with and without programmed reinforcement (i.e., edible items) for compliance with high-p instructions. Results showed that the high-p sequence increased compliance with low-p instructions only when compliance with high-p instructions was followed by reinforcement. In Experiment 2, we examined the role of reinforcer quality by delivering a lower quality reinforcer (praise) for compliance with high-p instructions. Results of Experiment 2 showed that the high-p sequence with lower quality reinforcement did not improve compliance with low-p instructions; the addition of a higher quality reinforcer (i.e., edible items) contingent on compliance with high-p instructions did increase compliance with low-p instructions. </str>

      <str>Plasma homocysteine concentrations in a group of 80-year-old persons were related to symptoms and signs. Plasma homocysteine concentrations higher than 15 micromol/l were associated with lower total life satisfaction (P&lt;0.01), mood (P&lt;0.05), zest for life (P&lt;0.05), lower scores for reasoning (P&lt;0.05), spatial ability (P&lt;0.05), memory recognition (P&lt;0.05), and subjective health (P&lt;0.01). In an instrument comprising of 30 symptoms, plasma homocysteine concentrations higher than 15 micromol/l were associated with impaired concentration (P&lt;0.05), restlessness (P&lt;0.05), feeling cold (P&lt;0.05), loss of weight (P&lt;0.05), and feeling depressed (P&lt;0.01). The above data indicate that plasma homocysteine values over 15 micromol/l could be relevant markers for clinical intervention.</str>

      <str>In the present study, the current levels of pesticide residues were studied in the human populace of Punjab state. A total of 111 human blood samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and pesticide residues were detected in 35 % of the blood sample(s). Residues of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p' DDD), p,p' dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p' DDE), p,p' dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p' DDT), β-endosulfan, monocrotophos, profenophos and phosalone were found in human blood samples with mean levels of 1.11, 5.89, 0.51, 3.88, 0.39, 34.90, 0.79, 0.39 and 6.76 ng ml(-1), respectively, with β-endosulfan as a leading pesticide residue. A paradigm shift in the pattern of the pesticide usage was observed with a shift from organochlorine pesticides to organophosphates. </str>

      <str>Untreated monkey liver cytochrome P-450 (monkey P-450) has been purified to a specific content of 14.9 n mole/mg protein. The purified preparation was apparently homogeneous and the minimum molecular weight was estimated to be 50,000 by SDS-PAGE. Absolute spectrum of the oxidized form showed peaks at 565, 535 and 417 nm. The monkey P-450 was active in the mixed function oxidation of benzphetamine, aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, aniline and 7-ethoxycoumarin in the presence of rat liver NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and DLPC. Anti monkey P-450 IgG could not inhibit rat P-450s (PB P-450, MC P-448(1) and MC P-448(2] catalyzed 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation activities.</str>

      <str>Treatment of Sprague Dawley rats with 3-methoxy-4-aminoazobenzene (3-MeO-AAB) resulted in striking increase of the activity of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450s which could efficiently catalyze the mutagenic activation of hepatocarcinogenic aromatic amines such as a tryptophan-pyrolysate component, Trp P-2, and a glutamic acid-pyrolysate component, Glu P-1. The 3-MeO-AAB-induced cytochrome P-450 (3-MeO-AAB-P-450) was examined for the molecular character by immuno-Western blotting using monoclonal antibody to 3-methylcholanthrene-induced cytochrome P-448 (P-448H; m.w. 54,000).</str>

      <str>37 patients undergoing lumbar puncture for various diagnostic purposes.</str>
      <str>Samples of cerebrospinal fluid and blood were obtained at the same visit. Substance P was measured by radioimmunoassay technique. At least 4 separate measurements were conducted on each sample to insure accuracy.</str>
      <str>The mean plasma SP level was 1.195 (+/- 1.1). The mean cerebrospinal fluid substance P level was 1.075 (+/- .07). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between substance P level in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.656 (P &lt; .0001) and the Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.698 (P &lt; .0001).</str>

      <str>Macroscopic disseminating peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer (P) was investigated in relation to its compatibility with microscopic findings (p) in 52 (P1 19, P2 21, P3 12) cases among 240 gastrectomized cases by cytological, histological, clinical and postmortem findings. In total, numbers of the evaluations for yes (P is p), probable (P is probably p), possible (P is possibly p), probably not (P is probably not p) and no (P is not p) were 28 (53.8%), 8 (15.4%), 14 (26.9%), 2 (3.8%) and 0, respectively, These results indicate that macroscopic disseminating peritoneal metastasis is compatible with microscopic findings, in most cases. Although histology is the most contributory factor for the evaluation of peritoneal dissemination, cytology of lavaged saline from the Douglas pouch also is important.</str>

      <str>Cells of Paramecium primaurelia in the immaturity period of the life cycle contain substances which repress the expression of mating ability when introduced into mature cells. When the immature cytoplasm of P. primaurelia was injected into mating-reactive cells of P. tetraurelia, P. caudatum and P. multimicronucleatum, immaturity was also induced in them. But the immature cytoplasm of P. primaurelia was ineffective when injected into mature cells of P. bursaria. When the immature cytoplasm of P. bursaria was injected into mating-reactive cells of P. primaurelia and P. tetraurelia, no difference from the control was observed. When the immature cytoplasm of P. caudatum was injected into mating-reactive cells of P. primaurelia and P. tetraurelia, immaturity was induced in cells of the latter 2 species.</str>

      <str>Occurrence of bacteriocinogeneity in 120 strains of 24 species of Pseudomonas was studied. Active strains producing bacteriocine-like substances were detected among P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. taetrolens, P. fragi, P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. maltophilia, and P. pseudoalcaligenes. The bacteriocine-like substances produced by them differed by the morphology of the zones of the test microbe growth inhibition, sensitivity to temperature and enzymes, capacity for dialysis through cellophane membranes and antimicrobial spectrum. The majority of them could be synthesized on agarized and liquid media and induced by UV light and mitomycin C. The strains of P. taetrolens, P. fragi, P. putida and P. fluorescens producing the bacteriocine-like substances had broad antimicrobial spectrum and inhibited the growth of many species of Pseudomonas and representatives of other taxonomic groups of microorganisms.</str>

      <str>The D(P)/L(P) convention is a stereochemical notation for P-chiral nucleotide analogs and related compounds. In contrast to the absolute R(P)/S(P) notation, the D(P)/L(P) system is based on a geometrical relationship between substituents in a dinucleoside monophosphate skeleton. The D(P)/L(P) notation is a convenient alternative to the R(P)/S(P) notation for stereochemical correlation analysis of physical, chemical, and biological properties of nucleotide and oligonucleotide analogs bearing any type of tri- or tetra-coordinated phosphorus moiety.</str>

      <str>P selectin is a component of endothelial Wiebel-Palade body membrane and platelet alpha granule membrane. Patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) have low plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF). To examine the relationship between plasma P selectin and VWF, both were measured by ELISA in 38 patients with VWD and 40 controls. The patient had lower VWF (P &lt; 0.001) but similar P selectin levels (P = 0.458). In 24 type 1 VWD patients, VWF and P selectin correlated inversely (P = 0.005) but in 14 type 2 VWD patients there was no correlation (P = 0.997). These data imply major differences in VWF/P-selectin regulation between types 1 and 2 VWD.</str>

Residual FEV1/FVC increased with age (P=0.005), BMI (P=0.011) and waist circumference (P=0.003). Residual FVC related inversely to hs-CRP (-0.178), P&lt;0.06) systolic (-0.028, P&lt;0.031), diastolic (-0.247, P&lt;0.010) pressure and weight (-0.25, P&lt;0.009).

      <str>As only six useful microsatellite loci that exhibit broad cross-amplification are so far available for Prosopis species, it is necessary to develop a larger number of codominant markers for population genetic studies. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers obtained for Prosopis species from a 454 pyrosequencing run were optimized and characterized for studies in P. alba and P. chilensis. •</str>
      <str>Twelve markers that were successfully amplified showed polymorphism in P. alba and P. chilensis. The number of alleles per locus ranged between two and seven and heterozygosity estimates ranged from 0.2 to 0.8. Most of these loci cross-amplify in P. ruscifolia, P. flexuosa, P. kuntzei, P. glandulosa, and P. pallida. •</str>
      <str>These loci will enable genetic diversity studies of P. alba and P. chilensis and contribute to fine-scale population structure, indirect estimation of relatedness among individuals, and marker-assisted selection.</str>

      <str>A multiresidue technique was developed for the analysis of 17 organochlorine compounds in cheese: alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), beta-HCH, gamma-HCH, delta-HCH, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, chlordane, o,p'- ... (o,p'-DDT), p,p'-DDT, o,p'- ... (o,p'-DDD), p,p'-DDD, o,p'- ... (o,p'-DDE), p,p'-DDE, and the fungicide hexachlorobenzene. In this technique, the fat, previously extracted from the cheeses, was subjected to 2 cleanup and extraction methods: with H2SO4, for acid-resistant organochlorine pesticides, and with KOH-ethanol. The behavior of the compounds in both treatments enabled us to identify the organochlorine pesticides in cheese. The precision (repeatability and reproducibility) and accuracy of the technique were validated.</str>

      <str>Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) of known age from 1 to 12 years were taken from Cayuga Lake in central New York State in 1991 and p,p'-DDE and mercury were determined in their flesh. The concentrations of p,p'-DDE and mercury increased significantly (p less than 0.001) with increasing age of the fish. The concentration of p,p'-DDE also increased significantly (p less than 0.001) with increasing fat content. The concentrations of p,p'-DDE were much lower than those found in Cayuga Lake trout of similar age captured in 1978.</str>

      <str>Hypokinesia (diminished movement) induces significant phosphate (P) change, however, little is known about P retention and P depletion during hypokinesia (HK). Measuring P retention and P balance during HK and P supplementation, the objective of this work was to disclose whether HK could contribute to the decreased P retention and consequently to P depletion in normal subjects.</str>
      <str>Studies were done during 30 days pre-HK period and 364 days HK period. Forty normal male individuals aged, 25.3+/-6.4 years were chosen as subjects. They were divided equally into 4 groups: unsupplemented active control subjects (UACS), unsupplemented hypokinetic subjects (UHKS), supplemented active control subjects (SACS) and supplemented hypokinetic subjects (SHKS). Hypokinetic subjects were limited to an average walking distance of 0.5 km day-l, while active control subjects were kept on an average running distance of 9.6 km day-l. Both, SHKS and SACS received daily 14 mmol dicalcium phosphate per kg body weight.</str>
      <str>Negative P balance, fecal P, urinary calcium (Ca) and P excretion, serum P and total (Cat) level increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) while P retention, serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25 (OH)2 D3) and thyrocalcitonin (TC) decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in SHKS and UHKS compared with their pre-HK values and their respective active controls (SACS and UACS). However, negative P balance, P retention incapacity, serum, fecal and urinary P level increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) more in SHKS compared with UHKS. Fecal P loss, urinary P and Ca loss, serum P and Cat level, iPTH, TC and 1,25 (OH)2 D3 level, P retention and P balance change insignificantly (p&gt;0.05) in SACS and UACS compared with their pre-HK level.</str>
      <str>It was concluded that a significant P excretion in urine and feces in spite of negative P balance and P supplementation may demonstrate reduced P retention, while a significant increase of negative P balance may demonstrate P depletion. Clearly, P intake, regardless of its low or higher dose, was significantly wasted during HK probably due to the decreased ability of the body to retain P.</str>

      <str>The aim of the present study was to examine a recent proposal that inhibitory isozyme:isozyme interactions explain why membrane-bound isozymes of rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 exert only a fraction of the catalytic activity they express when purified and reconstituted with saturating amounts of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and optimal amounts of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine. The different pathways of testosterone hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochromes P-450a (7 alpha-hydroxylation), P-450b (16 beta-hydroxylation), and P-450c (6 beta-hydroxylation) enabled possible inhibitory interactions between these isozymes to be investigated simultaneously with a single substrate. No loss of catalytic activity was observed when purified cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, or P-450c were reconstituted in binary or ternary mixtures under a variety of incubation conditions. When purified cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c were reconstituted under conditions that mimicked a microsomal system (with respect to the absolute concentration of both the individual cytochrome P-450 isozyme and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase), their catalytic activity was actually less (69-81%) than that of the microsomal isozymes. These results established that cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c were not inhibited by each other, nor by any of the other isozymes in the liver microsomal preparation. Incorporation of purified NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase into liver microsomes from Aroclor 1254-induced rats stimulated the catalytic activity of cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c. Similarly, purified cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c expressed increased catalytic activity in a reconstituted system only when the ratio of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase to cytochrome P-450 exceeded that normally found in liver microsomes. These results indicate that the inhibitory cytochrome P-450 isozyme:isozyme interactions described for warfarin hydroxylation were not observed when testosterone was the substrate. In addition to establishing that inhibitory interactions between different cytochrome P-450 isozymes is not a general phenomenon, the results of the present study support a simple mass action model for the interaction between membrane-bound or purified cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase during the hydroxylation of testosterone.</str>

      <str>The inheritance of resistance of the self-incompatible Myrobalan plum Prunus cerasifera to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria was studied using first a diallel cross between five parents of variable host suitability (including two highly resistant clones P.1079 and P.2175, a moderate host P.2032, a good host P.2646 and an excellent host P.16.5), followed by the G2 crosses P.16.5 × (P.2646 × P.1079) and P.2646 × (P.16.5 × P.1079). A total of 355 G1 and 72 G2 clones obtained from hard-wood cuttings sampled from trees in the field experimental design, then rooted in the nursery and inoculated individually in containers (5-10 replicates per clone) under greenhouse conditions, were evaluated for their host suitability based on a 0-5 gall-index rating under a high and durable inoculum pressure of the nematode. In the crosses involving the resistant P.1079 and P.2175 and the hosts P.2646 and P.16.5: (1) all of the G1 crosses of P.1079 were resistant while the G2 crosses segregated 1 resistant to 1 host, (2) the G1 crosses between P.2175 and either P.2646 or P.16.5 segregated 1 resistant to 1 host, and (3) all of the G1 progeny between P.2646 and P.16.5 were host. These results indicate that resistance is conferred by a single major dominant resistance gene (homozygous) in P.1079, and the same, or an allelic or a different, major dominant gene (heterozygous) in P.2175, and that P.2646 and P.16.5 are recessive for this (these) major resistance gene(s). As expected according to the hypothesis of a recessive genotype for P.2032, all of its hybrids with P.1079 were resistant, all of its hybrids with P.2646 and P.16.5 were host, and its hybrids with P.2175 segregated for resistance. Nevertheless, the 3∶2 segregation ratio of these latter hybrids suggests that clones bearing the P.2175 gene would have a selective advantage. Both resistance genes are completely dominant and confer a non-host behaviour that totally prevents the multiplication of the nematode. This is the first reported evidence of major nematode resistance genes towards M. arenaria in a species of the subgenus Prunophora in the genus Prunus. The symbols Ma1 for the P.2175 gene and Ma2 for the P.1079 gene are proposed. </str>

      <str>This study was planned to investigate the parameters detecting risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with sinus rhythm with structural heart disease. Forty-five patients with AF and 37 patients without AF but with structural heart disease (Group I) were included in this study. Thirty-eight patients (Group II) had successfully undergone medically or electrically cardioversion after transesophageal echocardiography. The restoration of sinus rhythm could not be achieved in 7 patients who were excluded from this study. After providing sinus rhythm, amiodarone was given orally to the patients to prevent recurrences. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated and left atrial diameter (LAD) was measured by echocardiography in group I and in group II after cardioversion. A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was simultaneously obtained from all the patients. In these ECG recordings, maximum P wave duration (P max), minimum P wave duration (P min), and P wave dispersion (P dispersion) were calculated. P dispersion was expressed as "P max-P min." Also, the highest P wave voltage is expressed as P amplitude maximum (P amp max), the lowest P wave as P amplitude minimum (P amp min), and P amplitude dispersion (P amp dispersion) was calculated as the difference of both. In univariate analysis, P max, P dispersion, P amp max, P amp dispersion, LAD, LVEF, and old age were significant predictors of chronic AF (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.003, p = 0.02, and p = 0.01, respectively). However, in multivariate analysis, P max and LAD were independent predictors of chronic AF in patients with structural heart disease (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.34; p &lt; 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, in estimating the risk of developing chronic AF, P max and LAD are predictive parameters in patients with sinus rhythm with structural heart disease.</str>

      <str>Hypokinesia (diminished movement) induces phosphate (P) changes; however, it is not known if P change is greater in trained than untrained subjects. Measuring P balance and P retention during hypokinesia (HK) and P load, we studied if changes in P retention and P depletion were significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater in trained than untrained subjects. Studies were done during a 30-d pre-HK period and a 364-d HK period. Forty male trained and untrained healthy individuals aged 24.5+/-5.4 yr were chosen as subjects. All volunteers were equally divided into four groups: trained ambulatory control subjects (TACS), trained hypokinetic subjects (THKS), untrained ambulatory control subjects (UACS), and untrained hypokinetic subjects (UHKS). All THKS and UHKS were limited to an average walking distance of 0.3 km/d, and TACS and UACS were on an average running distance of 9.8 and 1.8 km/d, respectively. Subjects took daily 12.7-mmol dicalcium-phosphate/kg body weight in the form of supplementation. Negative P balance, fecal P loss, urinary P and calcium (Ca) excretion, serum P, and total Ca (Cat) levels increased significantly (p&lt;0.05), whereas P retention, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25 (OH)2D3] and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in THKS and UHKS when compared with their pre-HK values and their respective ambulatory controls (TACS and UACS). However, P retention, P balance, serum, urinary, and fecal P, and serum hormone level changed significantly (p&lt;0.05) more in THKS than UHKS. Retention of P, fecal P, urinary P and Ca loss, serum P and Cat level, P balance, 1,25(OH)2D3, and iPTH level change insignificantly (p&gt;0.05) in TACS and UACS when compared with their pre-HK control values. It was concluded that significant negative P balance may indicate P depletion, whereas significant P loss in spite of negative P balance and P load may suggest P retention incapacity; however, P depletion was greater in THKS than UHKS. Clearly, P is wasted much more in THKS than UHKS.</str>

      <str>The present study aimed to investigate whether the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is activated in invasive breast cancer. The expression levels of phosphorylated (p)‑mTOR at ser2448 were detected, as well as the expression levels of its downstream signaling molecules: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E‑binding protein 1 (4E‑BP1), and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The correlation between p‑mTOR, p‑4E‑BP1, p‑S6K1, and the clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer were also determined. p‑mTOR, p‑4E‑BP1 and p‑S6K1 expression was detected in 285 breast cancer tumor samples and adjacent normal tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. The expression levels and the location of the proteins were analyzed and compared in the various tissue samples. Multivariate Cox regression was used to analyze the clinicopathological factors and prognosis associated with the tissue samples. The disease‑free survival rate was examined using survival analyses and Log‑rank tests. The results of the present study indicated that the expression levels of p‑mTOR, p‑4E‑BP1, and p‑S6K1 were significantly higher in breast cancer tissue, as compared with normal tissue (P&lt;0.01). p‑mTOR was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm, whereas p‑4E‑BP1 and p‑S6K1 were predominantly co‑expressed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In addition, p‑4E‑BP1 and p‑S6K1 were more likely to be expressed in the cytoplasm in breast cancer tissue samples, as compared with normal tissue samples (P&lt;0.001). Positive p‑mTOR was not significantly correlated with positive p‑4E‑BP1 and p‑S6K1 expression. The survival analyses of the patients with positive p‑mTOR, p‑4E‑BP1, and p‑S6K1 tissue samples were not significantly different from those of the patients with negative tissue samples (P&gt;0.05). Thus suggesting that these markers are not adequate risk factors for disease free survival (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that p‑mTOR, p‑4E‑BP1, and p‑S6K1 are activated in invasive breast cancer. In addition, the exclusive expression of p‑4E‑BP1 and p‑S6K1 in the cytoplasm may be characteristic of progressive breast cancer. However, p‑mTOR, p‑4E‑BP1, and p‑S6K1 are not prognostic factors for breast cancer. </str>

      <str>This study examined the P balance and fecal P losses in growing Standardbred horses in training fed a forage-only diet with or without P supplementation and assessed the magnitude and proportion of the soluble, inorganic P (Pi) fraction in feces. Fourteen Standardbred horses (aged 20.0 ± 0.3 mo) adapted to ad libitum intake of grass forage containing 0.25% P were used in a crossover experiment investigating 2 dietary treatments with (high-P) and without (low-P) mineral supplementation for 6 d. Daily feed intake and refusals were weighed. Spot samples of feces were collected twice daily on d 4 to 6 and analyzed for total P and Pi. Acid-insoluble ash was used as a marker for total fecal output. Spot samples of urine were collected once on d 4 to 6 and analyzed for P and creatinine. Daily P intake was greater (P &lt; 0.001) for the high-P diet (32.0 ± 0.6 g) than the low-P diet (17.5 ± 0.6 g), and the individual intake ranged from 13.3 to 38.4 g/d. Total fecal excretion of P was also greater (P &lt; 0.001) for the high-P diet (30.3 ± 0.8 g/d) than the low-P diet (17.0 ± 0.8 g/d) whereas excretion in urine was less than 0.2 g/d on both diets. Using simple regression analysis, fecal endogenous P losses were estimated to be less than 10 mg/kg BW. Phosphorus retention was 1.6 ± 0.6 and 0.3 ± 0.6 g/d on the high- and low-P diets, respectively, but only that for the high-P diet was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than 0 g/d. The proportion of Pi of total fecal P excretion was 100 ± 3% for the high-P diet and 87 ± 3% for the low-P diet (P = 0.005) and Pi increased linearly with P intake (y = 1.10x - 4.44; r(2) = 0.91; CV = 9.9%; P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, on this forage-only diet significant retention of P occurred at a daily P intake of 7.1 g/100 kg BW. Phosphorus was mainly excreted in feces and both total fecal P and Pi excretion had a strong relationship to P intake. More than 80% of total P appeared to be soluble. Fecal endogenous P losses were similar to those described previously in growing horses.</str>

      <str>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor of the head and neck region, which frequently occurs in Southeast Asia, especially in the south of China. It is known that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a central role in regulating cellular functions, including proliferation, growth, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis. Aberrant expression of the mTOR signaling pathway molecules has been found in many types of cancer. However, whether the alterations of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 protein expression are associated with clinicopathological features and prognostic implications in NPC have not been reported. The purposes of the present study are to investigate the association between the expression of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins and clinicopathological features in NPC by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the positive percentage of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins expression in NPC (47.2%, 73.0% and 61.7%, respectively) was significantly higher than that in the non-cancerous nasopharyngeal control tissue (33.3%, 59.1% and 47.0%, respectively). There was a significantly higher positive expression of p-Akt in undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma than that in differentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (P = 0.014). Additionally, positive expression of p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins, and positive expression of either of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 were significantly correlated inversely with overall survival rates of NPC patients (P = 0.023, P = 0.033, P = 0.008, respectively). Spearman's rank correlation test showed that expression of p-Akt in NPC was significantly associated with expression of p-p70S6K (r = 0.263, P&lt;0.001) and p-4EBP1(r = 0.284, P&lt;0.001). Also there was an obviously positive association between expression of p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins in NPC (r = 0.286, P&lt;0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further identified positive expression of p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K proteins were the independent poor prognostic factors for NPC (P = 0.043, P = 0.027, respectively). Taken together, high expression of p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins may act as valuable independent biomarkers to predict a poor prognosis of NPC. </str>

      <str>The status of phosphorylated eIF4E (p-eIF4E), phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), PTEN, phosphorylated tuberin (p-TSC2), phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), phosphorylated S6 (p-S6), and phosphorylated Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2) was studied using immunohistochemical analysis applied to a tissue microarray containing 300 NSCLCs. Staining results for each antibody were compared with clinical and pathologic features, and the relationship between staining results was explored.</str>
      <str>Overexpression of p-eIF4E, p-AKT, p-TSC2, p-mTOR, p-S6, and p-Erk1/2 in NSCLC was found in 39.9%, 78.8%, 5.1%, 46.7%, 27.1%, and 16.6% of tumors, respectively. The phenotype of p-eIF4E correlated positively with that of p-AKT, p-TSC2, and p-S6 (P &lt; 0.001). Overall survival in NSCLC patients was significantly shorter in cases with overexpression of p-eIF4E and p-AKT alone and in combination (log-rank P &lt; 0.001, each). Cases with underexpression of PTEN were limited (6.4%), and this phenotype did not correlate with any clinical variable. In cluster analysis, the p-AKT/p-mTOR/p-eIF4E/p-S6-positive group had significantly shorter survival compared with the survival of all cases (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that p-eIF4E overexpression is an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC (P = 0.004).</str>
      <str>This study shows that p-eIF4E expression in addition to p-AKT predicts poor prognosis in NSCLC. Moreover, the correlation between expression of p-eIF4E with p-AKT, as well as p-TSC2 and p-S6, indicates that eIF4E activation through the AKT pathway plays an important role in the progression of NSCLC.</str>

      <str>Eighteen gilts (initial BW of 10.9 kg; age 4 wk) were used in a 35-d experiment to study the effects of adding microbial phytase to a pearl millet-soybean meal-based diet on growth, apparent digestibility and retention of nutrients, and bone mineral status. The dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial with two levels of P (.58%, low-P or .95%, adequate-P) and three levels of microbial phytase (0, 700, or 1,000 units/kg of diet). Phosphorus, Ca, and N balance were determined from d 32 to 35. Blood samples were collected on d 0 and 35 for serum mineral analysis. Global bone mineral content (GBMC) and global bone mineral density (GBMD) were determined on d 0 and 35 using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A microbial phytase level x P level interaction was observed for final BW, ADG, gain:feed (P &lt; .001), and serum P concentration (P &lt; .003). Phytase supplementation of the low-P diets increased final BW, ADG, gain: feed, and serum inorganic P concentration but did not improve growth or serum inorganic P concentration in pigs fed the adequate-P diets. The addition of microbial phytase to the low-P and adequate-P diets reduced fecal P (P &lt; .01), fecal N (P &lt; .05), increased P absorption and retention (P &lt; .01), and increased N absorption (P &lt; .05). Pigs fed the adequate-P diets absorbed more P (P &lt; .01) but excreted more P (P &lt; .01) in the feces. Phytase tended to increase Ca (P &lt; .07) and N (P &lt; .10) retention, apparent threonine digestibility (P &lt; .06), and serum Zn concentration (P &lt; .09). Phytase increased GBMC and GBMD (P &lt; .04). Phosphorus also increased GBMC and GBMD (P &lt; .007 and P &lt; .002, respectively). These results show that supplemental microbial phytase in pearl millet-soybean meal diets increased P availability, decreased the amount of P excreted in feces, and increased bone mineralization in nursery pigs.</str>

      <str>The potential for anaerobic biodegradation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bischlorophenylethane (DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2,-bischlorophenylethane (DDD), and dichlorodiphenylchloroethylene (DDE) in anoxic sediment slurries collected from the Keelung River was investigated in this study. o,p'- and p,p'-DDT were dechlorinated to o,p'- and p,p'-DDD, respectively, and then transformed to other compound(s). 1-Chloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU) and trace amount of dichlorobenzophenone (DBP) were detected in sediment slurries amended with p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDD. DDMU was also detected in sediment slurries amended with p,p'-DDE. The relative transformation rates for both o,p'- and p,p'-isomers of DDT, DDD, and DDE were DDT&gt;DDD&gt;DDE. Re-addition of DDT, DDD, or DDE to the sediment slurries after initial removal enhanced the respective dechlorination rates. The transformation rates of the p,p'-isomers of both DDT and DDD were faster than those of the respective o,p'-isomers. p,p'-DDT dechlorination in the p,p'-DDT-adapted sediment slurries were inhibited by the addition of molybdate, or molybdate plus sulfate, but not inhibited by the addition of sulfate. Addition of bromoethane-sulfonic acid (BESA) slightly inhibited p,p'-DDT dechlorination. Non-adapted sediment slurries lost the ability to dechlorinate pentachlorophenol during adaptation to p,p'-DDT. p,p'-DDD was the major transformation product of p, p'-DDT in 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl-adapted sediment slurries, which suggested that the microbial community in the 3,4,4',5-CB-adapted sediment was unable to remove chlorine from the aromatic rings of p,p'-DDT.</str>

      <str>Storage of phosphorus (P) in stem tissue is important in Mediterranean Proteaceae, because proteoid root growth and P uptake is greatest during winter, whereas shoot growth occurs mostly in summer. This has prompted the present investigation of the P distribution amongst roots, stems, and leaves of Hakea prostrata R.Br. (Proteaceae) when grown in nutrient solutions at ten P-supply rates. Glasshouse experiments were carried out during both winter and summer months. For plants grown in the low-P range (0, 0.3, 1.2, 3.0, or 6.0 micromol d(-1)) the root [P] was &gt; stem and leaf [P]. In contrast, leaf [P] &gt; stem and root [P] for plants grown in the high-P range (6.0, 30, 60, 150, or 300 micromol P d(-1)). At the highest P-supply rates, the capacity for P storage in stems and roots appears to have been exceeded, and leaf [P] thereafter increased dramatically to approximately 10 mg P g(-1) dry mass. This high leaf [P] was coincident with foliar symptoms of P toxicity which were similar to those described for many other species, including non-Proteaceae. The published values (tissue [P]) at which P toxicity occurs in a range of species are summarized. X-ray microanalysis of frozen, full-hydrated leaves revealed that the [P] in vacuoles of epidermal, palisade and bundle-sheath cells were in the mM range when plants were grown at low P-supply, even though very low leaf [P] was measured in bulk leaf samples. At higher P-supply rates, P accumulated in vacuoles of palisade cells which were associated with decreased photosynthetic rates.</str>

      <str>A cohort of 270 superficial transitional cell bladder tumours (Ta-T1) was followed-up for over 8 years. WHO grade, papillary status and six nuclear factors were related to progression, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and bladder cancer-related survival (BS) during the follow-up period. Mean nuclear area (NA), standard deviation of nuclear area (SDNA), nuclear perimetry (PE), standard deviation of nuclear perimetry (SDPE), shortest nuclear axis (Dmin) and longest nuclear axis (Dmax) were significantly related to WHO grade and papillary status (P &lt; 0.0001). All the nuclear factors were related significantly to progression in univariate analysis (P &lt; 0.01) whereas in a multivariate analysis WHO grade (P &lt; 0.0001) and papillary status (P = 0.048) included independent prognostic information. RFS was related to PE (P = 0.009), SDPE (P = 0.013), Dmin (P = 0.021), Dmax (P = 0.028) and SDNA (P = 0.029). In papillary tumours SDPE (P = 0.007) and Dmin (P = 0.024) predicted RFS. BS was related to WHO grade, papillary status, NA, SDNA, PE, Dmax, Dmin (all P &lt; 0.0001) and to SDPE (P = 0.003). In papillary tumours PE (P &lt; 0.0001), Dmax (P = 0.0022), Dmin (P = 0.0027), WHO grade (P = 0.0036), NA (P = 0.0005), SDNA (P = 0.0355) and SDPE (P = 0.0718) predicted BS. In multivariate analysis SDPE (P = 0.029) predicted RFS and survival was related to WHO grade (P &lt; 0.001) and PE (P = 0.014) independently. In papillary tumours only Dmax (P = 0.001) predicted survival independently. The results show that superficial papillary transitional cell bladder tumours can be efficiently categorised into prognostic groups by nuclear image analysis and the results provide a new classification system for superficial papillary bladder tumours. Tumours with high nuclear factor values should be considered for radical primary therapy and adjuvant therapy after transurethral resections.</str>

      <str>In a case-control study of 346 subjects with and without COPD, we examined the polymorphisms 462Ile/Val, 3801T/C of CYP1A1, -3860G/A of CYP1A2 and -930A/G, 242C/T of CYBA individually or in combination and their contribution to oxidative stress markers by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).</str>
      <str>COPD patients had significantly increased MDA concentration (p&lt;0.001) and decreased CAT activity, GSH concentration, GPx activity (p&lt; or =0.01). The patients were over-represented by the alleles 462Val, 3801C of CYP1A1 and -930G, 242C of CYBA (p&lt;0.001, p=0.003, p=0.030 and p=0.031, respectively) and consequently the haplotypes of same alleles i.e. 462Val:3801C, 462Val:3801T and -930G:242C (p=0.048, p=0.016 and p=0.039, respectively). Similarly, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 haplotypes, 462Val:3860G and 462Val:3801T:3860G were significantly over-represented (p=0.001 and p=0.003), respectively in patients. The same alleles-associated genotype-combinations between genes were more prevalent in patients. Of note, the genotypes, 462Ile/Val+Val/Val, 3801TC+CC of CYP1A1 and -930AG+GG of CYBA associated with increased MDA concentration (p=0.018, p=0.045 and p=0.017, respectively), decreased CAT activity (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.080 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively) and GSH concentration (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.0002 and p=0.011, respectively) in patients.</str>

The DNA hydrolysate is first separated into a high- and a low-molecular weight pyrimidine nucleotide mixture by column chromatography at pH 7.5 on DEAE-cellulose. The high-molecular-weight pyrimidine nucleotide mixture is further separated into four peaks on QAE-Sephadex at pH 7.5. The second peak is re-chromatographed on QAE-Sephadex at pH 3.5. Pyrimidine nucleotides containing predominantly cytidylic acid units may thus be separated from these with predominantly thymidylic acid units. Subsequent separation according to number of phosphate groups at pH 7.5 on QAE-Sephadex yields products of 70--93% purity. In a final separation step, the pyrimidine nucleotides and mixtures of sequence isomers are once again chromatographed on QAE-Sephadex with 7 M urea at pH 7.5. The products thus obtained are generally chromatographically pure. Impurities which are not fully removed by column chromatography are separated by paper chromatography. The structure of the isolated DNA fragments and the composition of the mixtures of sequence isomers are determined from the chromatographic data, absorption characteristics and by enzymatic degradation.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1, MDR1) was recognized as a drug-exporting protein from cancer cells three decade ago. Apart from the multidrug transporter side effects of P-gp, normal physiological functions of P-gp have been reported. P-gp could be responsible for translocating platelet-activating factor (PAF) across the plasma membrane and PAF inhibited drug transport mediated by P-gp in cancer cells. P-gp regulated the translocation of sphingomyelin (SM) and GlcCer, and short chain C(6)-NBD-GlcCer was found in the apical medium of P-gp cells exclusively and not in the basolateral membrane. SM plays an important role in the esterification of cholesterol. High expression of P-gp prevents stem-cell differentiation, leading to the proliferation and amplification of this cell repertoire, and functional P-gp plays a fundamental role in regulating programmed cell death, apoptosis. The transporter function of P-gp is therefore necessary to protect cells from death. P-gp can translocate both C(6)-NBD-PC and C(6)-NBD-PE across the apical membrane. This PC translocation was also confirmed with [(3)H]choline radioactivity. Progesterone is not transported by P-gp, but blocks P-gp-mediated efflux of other drugs and P-gp can mediate the transport of a variety of steroids. Cells transfected with human P-gp esterified more cholesterol. P-gp might also be involved in the transport of cytokines, particularly IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4 and IFNgamma, out of activated normal lymphocytes into the surrounding medium. P-gp expression is also associated with a volume-activated chloride channel, thus P-gp is bifunctional with both transport and channel regulators. We also present information about P-gp polymorphism and new structural concepts, "gate" and "twist", of the P-gp structure.</str>

      <str>Tacrolimus, a potent immunosuppressive drug, is known to be metabolized predominantly in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). In order to determine the potential of tacrolimus to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, we have investigated its inhibitory effects on specific cytochrome reactions. Specific substrates for the seven cytochromes (CYPs) 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5 were incubated with human hepatic microsome preparations with or without specific inhibitors or tacrolimus and the metabolites were detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or fluorimetric methods. All the specific inhibitors reduced or abolished the specific CYP activity. Tacrolimus had no effect on any CYP at concentrations below 1 microM, while at higher concentrations it had a mild inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and 3A5. These observations suggest that tacrolimus is unlikely to potentiate the effect of coadministered drugs through inhibition of their metabolism in the liver.</str>

      <str>Despite stringent restrictions on their use by many countries since the 1970s, the endocrine disrupting chemicals, DDT and DDE are still ubiquitous in the environment. However, little attention has been directed to p,p'-DDT and the anti-androgen, p,p'-DDE on androgen receptor (AR) target gene transcription in human cells. Inhibitors of androgenic activity may have a deleterious clinical outcome in prostate cancer screens and progression, therefore we determined whether environmentally relevant concentrations of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE negatively impact AR-regulated expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and other AR target genes in human LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells. Quantitative real-time PCR and immuno-blotting techniques were used to measure intracellular PSA, PSMA and AR mRNA and protein levels. We have shown for the first time that p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE repressed R1881-inducible PSA mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we used the fully automated COBAS PSA detection system to determine that extracellular PSA levels were also significantly repressed. These chemicals achieve this by blocking the recruitment of AR to the PSA promoter region at 10μM, as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in LNCaP cells. Both p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE repressed R1881-inducible AR protein accumulation at 10μM. Thus, we conclude that men who have been exposed to either DDT or DDE may produce a false-negative PSA test when screening for prostate cancer, resulting in an inaccurate clinical diagnosis. More importantly, prolonged exposure to these anti-androgens may mimic androgen ablation therapy in individuals with prostate cancer, thus exacerbating the condition by inadvertently forcing adaptation to this stress early in the disease. </str>

CAD patients had a longer duration of diabetes (p&lt;0.001), were older at the onset of diabetes and at presentation (p=0.001), and had higher prevalences of retinopathy (p=0.005) and neuropathy (p=0.016).

Under logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age and sex), baseline urine albumin/creatinine ratio (p=0.003), presence of retinopathy (p=0.004), serum creatinine (p=0.028), and serum urea (p=0.034) were the most powerful predictors of mortality, while duration of diabetes (p&lt;0.0001), baseline HDL cholesterol (p=0.012), serum creatinine (p=0.02), apolipoprotein B (p=0.038), LDL cholesterol (p=0.039), and systolic blood pressure (p=0.055) were the strongest predictors of CAD. These findings emphasize the role of abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in the development of CAD in type 1 DM. Indicators of renal impairment and the presence of retinopathy seem to be of greater importance in predicting overall mortality.</str>

      <str>A 76-d feeding trial was conducted with 24 wether lambs (31 kg, initially) to study the interrelationships among dietary P, Al and Fe. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments included two concentrations of supplemental P (0 or .25%) with added P as NaH2PO4, two levels of supplemental Fe (0 or 760 ppm) with Fe added as ferric citrate and two levels of supplemental Al (0 or 1,450 ppm) with Al added as AlCl3 . 6H2O. The basal diet contained .17% P, 40 ppm Fe and 168 ppm Al. Phosphorus increased (P less than .01) feed consumption, but Fe (P less than .01), with added P improving and Fe or Al depressing gain. Additional P improved gain (P less than .05) and intake (P less than .01) in the presence of high Al and intake (P less than .05) when dietary Fe was high. Serum P was increased (P less than .01) by high dietary Fe and reduced (P less than .01) by Al. High dietary P increased (P less than .05) serum MG. High dietary Fe increased (P less than .01) hemoglobin and hematocrit and increased (P less than .01) Fe storage in liver, kidney, spleen and muscle but decreased (P less than .01) kidney Zn concentration. High dietary Al increased (P less than .01) liver Fe and kidney Zn levels but decreased kidney P and Mg (P less than .05) and bone ash and Mg (P less than .01). Based on these studies, additional dietary P appeared beneficial in overcoming the adverse effects of high dietary Al or Fe.</str>

      <str>The cytochrome P-450 (P-450) content of different regions of the rat brain was measured after partial purification of the enzyme from homogenates, and the quantitative contribution of P-450b,e and P-450c,d to brain P-450 was assessed by Western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry using rabbit antibodies raised against purified hepatic P-450b and P-450c, respectively). P-450 could be quantitated by its reduced CO difference spectrum after chromatography of homogenates on p-chloroamphetamine-coupled Sepharose. The yield of P-450 from whole brain was 90 +/- 19 pmol/g of tissue, which is approximately 1% of the level in liver microsomes from control rats. The amount of P-450 recovered from homogenates of olfactory lobes, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, cerebral cortex, and brainstem varied between 40 and 100 pmol/g of tissue. The cerebellum was a region of exceptionally high P-450 content, with yields of up to 400 pmol/g whereas the substantia nigra yielded only 16-20 pmol/g. Immunohistochemical studies with anti-P-450b and anti-P-450c revealed intense staining of a limited number of cells in the cerebellum with both antibodies and in the thalamus only with anti-P-450c. In the cerebellum, both anti-P-450b and anti-P-450c stained the Bergmann glial cells together with their radial processes. Individual glial cells in the granular cell layer were also stained. There was no staining of Purkinje cells. In the thalamus, anti-P-450b gave weak staining of certain astroglia, but with anti-P-450c, there was intense staining of neuronal somata.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Ab initio MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ calculations have been performed to determine the structures and binding energies of 22 open and 3 cyclic complexes formed from the sp2 [H(2)C=PH and HP=PH (cis and trans)] and sp3 [PH2(CH3) and PH3] hybridized phosphorus bases and their corresponding protonated ions. EOM-CCSD calculations have been carried out to obtain (31)P-(31)P and (31)P-(1)H coupling constants across P-H+-P hydrogen bonds. Two equilibrium structures with essentially linear hydrogen bonds have been found along the proton-transfer coordinate, except for complexes with P(CH3)H3+ as the proton donor to the sp2 bases. Although the isomer having the conjugate acid of the stronger base as the proton donor lies lower on the potential energy surface, it has a smaller binding energy relative to the corresponding isolated monomers than the isomer with the conjugate acid of the weaker base as the donor. The hydrogen bond of the latter has increased proton-shared character. All of the complexes are stabilized by traditional hydrogen bonds, as indicated by positive values of the reduced coupling constants (2h)K(P-P) and (1)K(P-H), and negative values of (1h)K(H-P). (2h)J(P-P) correlates with the P-P distance, a correlation determined primarily by the nature of the proton donor. For open complexes, (1)J(P-H) always increases relative to the isolated monomer, while (1h)J(H-P) is relatively small and negative. (2h)J(P-P) values are quite large in open complexes, but are much smaller in cyclic complexes in which the P-H+-P hydrogen bonds are nonlinear. Thus, experimental measurements of (2h)J(P-P) should be able to differentiate between open and cyclic complexes.</str>

The mRNA expression levels of GOLPH3, mTOR, Akt, p70S6 and 4E-BP1 in gastric cancer, carcinoma-adjacent and paired normal tissue were analyzed using RT-PCR. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression of GOLPH3, p-mTOR, p-Akt, p-p70S6 and p-4E-BP1 in tissues.</str>
      <str>High expression protein levels of GOLPH3, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p70S6, p-4E-BP1 were positively associated with histological grade (p&lt;0.05), depth of invasion (p&lt;0.05), distant metastasis (p&lt;0.05) and lymph node involvement (p&lt;0.05). Compared with carcinoma-adjacent and paired normal tissues, the mRNA expression levels of GOLPH3, AKT, mTOR, p70S6 and 4EBP1 in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher. The protein expression levels of GOLPH3, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70S6 and p-4E-BP1 in gastric cancer tissues were also significantly higher than in carcinoma-adjacent and paired normal tissues. A strong positive correlation was observed between GOLPH3, p-mTOR, p-p70S6 and p-4EBP1 expression (r = 0.410, 0.303 and 0.276, respectively, p&lt;0.05), but no significant correlation between the expression of GOLPH3 and p-Akt was observed.</str>

      <str>Among the various possible causes for drug interactions, pharmacokinetic factors such as inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, are regarded as the most frequent and clinically important. Gypenosides is widely used as functional food and over-the-counter drug in East Asia. In this study, the in vitro inhibitory effects of gypenosides on the major human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) activities in human liver microsomes were examined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gypenosides showed the strongest inhibition of CYP2D6, followed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. The IC50 values were 1.61 μg/mL, 20.06 μg/mL, 34.76 μg/mL (CYP3A4/midazolam), 46.73 μg/mL (CYP3A4/testosterone), and 54.52 μg/mL, respectively. Gypenosides exhibited competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 (Ki=1.18). In conclusion, Gypenosides might cause herb-drug interactions via inhibition of CYP2D6. An in vivo study is needed to examine this further.</str>

      <str>We investigated the role of P-selectin in arterial thrombogenesis by forming large stable platelet-leukocyte aggregates.</str>
      <str>Plaque rupture followed by thrombus formation is a fundamental pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes. Although the adhesive interaction between platelets and leukocytes via P-selectin is known to mediate platelet-rich thrombi, the true function of P-selectin in thrombus formation in vivo is unknown.</str>
      <str>In wild-type (P(+/+)) and P-selectin-deficient (P(-/-)) mice with ferric chloride (FeCl(3))-induced carotid arterial thrombosis model, we measured in vivo platelet P-selectin expression and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation. We also measured ex vivo ADP-induced whole blood aggregations and their size distribution by flow cytometry.</str>
      <str>Time to thrombotic occlusion was longer in P(-/-) mice than in P(+/+) mice. Spontaneous reflow after total thrombotic occlusion was observed in 8 of 10 P(-/-) mice but not in any P(+/+) mice. ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation was not different between the two groups. However, ADP-induced ex vivo whole blood aggregation was inhibited in P(-/-) mice compared to P(+/+) mice. FeCl(3) application increased in vivo expressions of platelet P-selectin in P(+/+) mice but not in P(-/-) mice. The number of leukocytes within thrombi was less in P(-/-) mice than in P(+/+) mice. In flow cytometric analysis of size distribution of ADP-induced whole blood aggregates, the number of large aggregates was less in P(-/-) mice than in P(+/+) mice. Using platelet and leukocyte fluorescence makers, the large aggregates were confirmed as platelet-leukocyte aggregates.</str>

Pre-operative resting (P less than 0.005), squeeze (P less than 0.005) and strain (P less than 0.005) anal pressures at 2 cm were significantly less than controls. Similarly, pressures during all three events at 4 cm were significantly less than controls (resting P less than 0.05, squeeze P less than 0.005, strain P less than 0.025). Median volume of first leak during saline infusion was significantly less than controls (P less than 0.005) as was the total tolerable volume (P less than 0.005). Videoproctographic parameters which differed significantly from controls included pelvic floor descent at rest (P less than 0.005), during contraction (P less than 0.005) and straining (P less than 0.05); resting and squeeze perineal descent (P less than 0.005); and anal canal length at rest and straining (P less than 0.005). Anorectal angles, rectal compliance, rectal sensation and emptying did not differ from controls. None of these parameters was improved by postanal repair.

      <str>In this study, the homologous C-termini of Lol p I, Lol p II, and Lol p III were shown to contain cross-reactive B-cell epitopes. This was demonstrated by inhibition studies with purified Lol p I, II, and III and synthetic peptides of their C-termini. It was ruled out that the observed cross-reactivity was caused by cross-contamination of the purified allergens. Both human IgE and IgG bound to the C-terminus of Lol p I. These antibodies were cross-reactive with Lol p II and, more specifically, with its C-terminus. Within a small panel of allergic patients, no cross-reactivity with Lol p III was found. A hyperimmune polyclonal rabbit antiserum against Lol p I also recognized the Lol p I C-terminus. As for human antibodies, cross-reactivity with Lol p II and its C-terminus was demonstrated. Cross-reactivity with Lol p III was demonstrated with C-terminal peptides, but not with native Lol p III. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against Lol p II bound to the C-terminal peptides of both Lol p II and III. This binding was inhibited with Lol p I, confirming that cross-reactive structures exist not only on the C-termini of Lol p II and Lol p I, but also of Lol p III and Lol p I. The existence of cross-reactivity between Lol p I and Lol p II and III possibly contributes to the frequently observed cosensitization for these allergens in grass-pollen-allergic patients.</str>

      <str>Tributyltin and 1, 1-dichloro-2, 2 bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE) have been ubiquitously distributed over the world. In Japan, p,p'-DDE and tributyltin are ingested through marine products, in which these substances are accumulated through bio-concentration and the food chain. However, the consequence of potential combined hazards of these substances remains unknown. Therefore, the effects of concurrent exposure to 125 ppm p,p'-DDE and 25 ppm tributyltin were investigated in immature male Wistar rats by oral administration during puberty. In this study, tributyltin promoted the growth of pubertal male rats, while p,p'-DDE itself did not affect the growth but inhibited the growth enhancement by tributyltin. Furthermore, tributyltin reduced thymus weight but p,p'-DDE also prevented this weight reduction. Neither development of male sexual accessory organs nor sexual maturation was affected even by concurrent exposure to p,p'-DDE and tributyltin. No significant changes of serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations, and epididymal sperm numbers were observed with the administration of p,p'-DDE and/or tributyltin. These results indicate that sexual maturation, male reproductive organ development and sperm production is scarcely affected in immature male Wistar rats even by concurrent exposure to p,p'-DDE and tributyltin at a daily dose of ca. 2 mg/kg tributyltin and 10 mg/kg p,p'-DDE. Moreover, the simultaneous administration of p,p'-DDE with tributyltin counterbalanced the effects that were attributed to tributyltin alone.</str>

      <str>The protruding (P) domain of norovirus VP1 is responsible for immune recognition and host receptor interaction. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a modification of the ends of the P domain affects the conformation and/or function of the P protein. An expression of the P domain with or without the hinge, or with an additional cysteine at either ends of the P protein resulted in P dimers and/or P particles. Here we report a new type of subviral particle, the small P particles, through a further modification, either an addition of the flag tag or a change of the arginine cluster, at the C-terminus of the cysteine-containing P domain. Gel filtration and cryo-EM studies showed that the small P particles are tetrahedrons formed by 6 P dimers or 12 P monomers that is half-size of the P particles. Fitting of the crystal structure of the P domain into the cryo-EM density map of the particle indicated similar conformations of the P dimers as those in P particles. The small P particles bind human HBGAs and are antigenically reactive similar to their parental VLPs and P particles. These data suggest that the C-terminus of the P domain is an important factor in the formation of the P particles. Further elucidation of the mechanism of these modifications in the P particle formation would be important in structure biology and morphogenesis of noroviruses. The small P particles may also be a useful alternative in study of norovirus-host interaction and vaccine development for noroviruses.</str>

      <str>In an incubation test, a calcareous soil with low concentration of available P was amended with KH2PO4 (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg P x kg(-1)) and ground wheat straw (5 g C x kg(-1)), and incubated at 25 degrees C for 90 days. The aim was to investigate the change patterns of soil microbial biomass P and microbial P concentration as well as their relationships with soil available P. The results showed that both soil microbial biomass P and microbial P concentration increased with increasing inorganic P addition, with the maximum being 71.37 and 105.34 mg x kg(-1), respectively. The combined application of inorganic P (except 100 mg P x kg(-1)) and wheat straw decreased the soil microbial biomass P and microbial P concentration, being most obvious at early incubation period. Soil microbial biomass P and microbial P concentration had significant positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) with soil available P (R2 = 0.26 and 0.40, n = 49, respectively). The applied P could rapidly transform into microbial biomass P. The maximum apparent contribution rate of applied P to microbial biomass P was 71%. The added wheat straw could further improve the apparent contribution rate.</str>

      <str>The objective of this study was to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in consecutive clinical Candida albicans isolates from a single patient displaying stepwise-acquired multidrug resistance.</str>
      <str>Nine clinical isolates (P-1 to P-9) were susceptibility tested by EUCAST EDef 7.2 and Etest. P-4, P-5, P-7, P-8 and P-9 were available for further studies. Relatedness was evaluated by MLST. Additional genes were analysed by sequencing (including FKS1, ERG11, ERG2 and TAC1) and gene expression by quantitative PCR (CDR1, CDR2 and ERG11). UV-spectrophotometry and GC-MS were used for sterol analyses. In vivo virulence was determined in the insect model Galleria mellonella and evaluated by log-rank Mantel-Cox tests.</str>
      <str>P-1 + P-2 were susceptible, P-3 + P-4 fluconazole resistant, P-5 pan-azole resistant, P-6 + P-7 pan-azole and echinocandin resistant and P-8 + P-9 MDR. MLST supported genetic relatedness among clinical isolates. P-4 harboured four changes in Erg11 (E266D, G307S, G450E and V488I), increased expression of ERG11 and CDR2 and a change in Tac1 (R688Q). P-5, P-7, P-8 and P-9 had an additional change in Erg11 (A61E), increased expression of CDR1, CDR2 and ERG11 (except for P-7) and a different amino acid change in Tac1 (R673L). Echinocandin-resistant isolates harboured the Fks1 S645P alteration. Polyene-resistant P-8 + P-9 lacked ergosterol and harboured a frameshift mutation in ERG2 (F105SfsX23). Virulence was attenuated (but equivalent) in the clinical isolates, but higher than in the azole- and echinocandin-resistant unrelated control strain.</str>

      <str>Cardiovascular mortality is increased in transplant recipients. However, studies including non-fatal events are critical to assess the burden of disease and to identify novel risk factors. We described the incidence of fatal and non-fatal events, and explored associations and interactions among traditional and transplant-specific risk factors and cardiovascular events (CVE) in a cohort of 922 patients transplanted between 1993 and 1998. One hundred and seventy-six patients experienced 201 CVE (111 cardiac, 48 cerebrovascular, 42 peripheral-vascular). Most CVE were non-fatal. Factors associated with cardiac events were (adjusted hazard ratios) tobacco (3.53; P&lt;0.001), obesity (2.92; P&lt;0.001), diabetes (2.63; P&lt;0.001), multiple rejections (2.19; P=0.008), prior CVE (2.0; P=0.004), dialysis &gt;1 year (1.91; P=0.007), and overweight status (1.68; P=0.04); with cerebrovascular events: diabetes and peritoneal dialysis (11.95; P&lt;0.001), age &gt;45 (6.77; P&lt;0.001), diabetes (4.87; P&lt;0.001), prior CVE (3.73; P&lt;0.001), creatinine &gt;141 micromol/l (3.16; P=0.001), peritoneal dialysis (3.06; P=0.027), and obesity (0.32; P=0.046); with peripheral-vascular events: diabetes (8.48; P&lt;0.001), tobacco and cytomegalovirus (3.88; P&lt;0.001), age &gt;45 (2.31; P=0.019), and prior CVE (2.25; P=0.016); with mortality: tobacco and deceased-donor (3.52; P&lt;0.001), age &gt;45 (1.81; P=0.002), diabetes (1.76; P=0.002), pulse pressure (1.64; P=0.029), prior CVE (1.52; P=0.04), and dialysis &gt;1 year (1.47; P=0.04). The majority of CVE post-transplant were non-fatal. Previous CVE was strongly associated with CVE post-transplant. Interactions among transplant-specific and traditional risks impacted significantly the incidence of CVE. Modifiable factors such as duration of dialysis, deceased-donor transplantation, and acute rejection should be viewed as cardiovascular risks.</str>

      <str>Pyxicephalus currently contains three recognized species, viz. P. adspersus, P. edulis and P. obbianus, the former two of which have a long history of confusion. Parry (1982) described P. adspersus angusticeps from Beira, Mozambique, which was synonymized with P. edulis. We re-examine the taxonomic status of Pyxicephalus taxa from Mozambique, examining the types and contrasting them to congeners throughout Africa. Morphological characters previously used to delimit species in Pyxicephalus are examined, and problems with some identified. Additional diagnostic characters and their variation in Pyxicephalus are discussed, and a revised key is provided. Confusion among species in the genus, type localities, literature and folklore led to P. adspersus angusticeps being incorrectly synonymized with P. edulis. We formally revalidate P. angusticeps, and designate a lectotype for P. edulis. The identity of voucher specimens from previous work suggests that the breeding ecology of P. angusticeps is distinct from that of P. adspersus and P. edulis, and that the advertisement call of P. angusticeps was used as part of the evidence for elevating P. edulis out of synonymy with P. adspersus. The previous confusion of P. adspersus and P. edulis does not affect the recognition of P. angusticeps. The wider implication of the previous misidentification of P. angusticeps as P. edulis is that most of the museum material labeled as P. adspersus from East Africa is P. edulis, and most of the museum material labeled as P. edulis from East Africa is P. angusticeps. This conclusion has been confirmed from East African museum material thus far examined. </str>

      <str>River eutrophication could drastically influence the phosphorus (P) in the water and sediment. To understand the biogenic-P species, distribution and bioconversion, five sediment samples were collected from an artificial river, and analyzed by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance ((31)P-NMR). The P pollution in the water and sediment were both severe. The average concentrations of total P (TP) and solution reactive phosphorus in the water were 3.0 and 2.6 mg L(-1), respectively, which surpass grade V of the national quality standard (China) and should not be used for any purpose. The river sediments accumulated significant inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and organic phosphorus (Po); in the P fractionation, the rank order of the P fractions was as follows: Ca-P &gt; NaOH-Pi &gt; Res-P &gt; KCl-P &gt; NaOH-Po, with average relative proportions of 25.1:16.8:6.6:1.7:1:0. Six P compounds were detected in the NaOH-EDTA extract by (31)P-NMR. Mono-P (8.96-29.58 %) was the dominant forms of biogenic-P, and other smaller fractions of biogenic-P were also observed, including pyro-P (0.22-0.86 %), DNA-P (0.75-2.03 %), phon-P (0-1.57 %), and lipids-P (0-2.66 %). The TP and biogenic-P decreased along the direction of flows, with their average relative proportions 7.97:1.20:1.49:1.00:1.00 and 40.87:2.34:3.46:1.60:1 from the upstream to downstream, respectively. The concentration and species of Po in NaOH-Po were lower than found in (31)P-NMR analysis in this research. Thus, the use of 0.25 M NaOH and 50 mM EDTA extracts and solution (31)P-NMR analysis was a more accurate method for quantifying biogenic-P in the river sediments than P fractionation.</str>

      <str>Bovine adrenal P-45011 beta catalyzes the 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylation of corticosteroids as well as aldosterone synthesis. These activities of P-45011 beta were found to be modulated by another mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 species, P-450scc. The presence together of P-45011 beta and P-450scc in liposomal membranes was found to remarkably stimulate the 11 beta-hydroxylase activity of P-45011 beta and also stimulate the cholesterol desmolase activity of P-450scc. The stimulative effect of P-450scc on 11 beta-hydroxylase activity diminished by the addition of protein-free liposomes to proteoliposomes containing P-45011 beta and P-450scc, thus showing P-450scc to interact with P-45011 beta in the same membranes. Kinetic analysis of this effect indicated the formation of an equimolar complex between P-45011 beta and P-450scc on liposomal membranes. P-45011 beta in the complex had not only stimulated activity for 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone but also suppressed activity for production of 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone. When the inner mitochondrial membranes of zona fasciculata-reticularis from bovine adrenal were treated with anti-P-450scc IgG, aldosterone formation was stimulated to a greater extent than that of zona glomerulosa. This indicates the aldosterone synthesizing activity of P-45011 beta in the zona fasciculata-reticularis to be suppressed by interaction with P-450scc. The zone-specific aldosterone synthesis of P-45011 beta in bovine adrenal may possibly be induced by differences in interactions with P-450scc of mitochondrial membranes in each zone.</str>

      <str>This study was designed to characterize epidermal cytochrome P-450 (P-450) induced by skin application of beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF). Topical application of beta-NF (40 mg/kg) to rats resulted in a 2.6-times increase in epidermal P-450 content and a 3--14-times increase in epidermal monooxygenase activities. The purified epidermal P-450 showed a major band at 54 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which comigrated with hepatic P-4501A1 and cross-reacted with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific to P-4501A1. The specific content of purified epidermal P-450 was 1.53 nmol/mg protein, representing 42-times purification. HPLC analysis of the purified epidermal P-450 showed similar elution profile and retention time as that of hepatic P-4501A1. The purified preparation efficiently catalyzed-benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation when reconstituted with purified NADPH--P-450 reductase and phospholipid. Peptide fingerprint analysis of the purified epidermal P-450 and hepatic P-4501A1 showed similar monoclonal antibody 1-7-1 reacting epitopes. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified epidermal P-450 showed complete homology with the known sequence of P-4501A1. Similarly, HPLC analysis of tryptic digest of purified epidermal P-450 and hepatic P-4501A1 showed identical peptide peaks with comparable retention times. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of three randomly selected tryptic peptides showed complete homology with the known sequence of P-4501A1. These results indicate that rat epidermal P-450 induced by beta-NF is similar to hepatic P-4501A1.</str>

      <str>Differences in the properties of organic phosphorus (P) sources, particularly those that undergo treatment to reduce soluble P, can affect soil P solubility and P transport in surface runoff. This 2-yr field study investigated soil P solubility and runoff P losses from two agricultural soils in the Mid-Atlantic region after land application of biosolids derived from different waste water treatment processes and poultry litter. Phosphorus speciation in the biosolids and poultry litter differed due to treatment processes and significantly altered soil P solubility and dissolved reactive P (DRP) and bioavailable P (FeO-P) concentrations in surface runoff. Runoff total P (TP) concentrations were closely related to sediment transport. Initial runoff DRP and FeO-P concentrations varied among the different biosolids and poultry litter applied. Over time, as sediment transport declined and DRP concentrations became an increasingly important component of runoff FeO-P and TP, total runoff P was more strongly influenced by the type of biosolids applied. Throughout the study, application of lime-stabilized biosolids and poultry litter increased concentrations of soil-soluble P, readily desorbable P, and soil P saturation, resulting in increased DRP and FeO-P concentrations in runoff. Land application of biosolids generated from waste water treatment processes that used amendments to reduce P solubility (e.g., FeCl(3)) did not increase soil P saturation and reduced the potential for DRP and FeO-P transport in surface runoff. These results illustrate the importance of waste water treatment plant process and determination of specific P source coefficients to account for differential P availability among organic P sources.</str>

Chromosomes 1 and 19 status was detected with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Of the 584 cases, the frequency of 1q and 19p polysomy in mixed gliomas was significantly higher than ODGs or astrocytic tumors (1q P = 0.032 and P = 0.044; 19p P = 0.024 and P = 0.027); the frequency of 1q and 19p polysomy in low-grade gliomas (WHO II) was relatively lower compared with WHO III or WHO IV (1q P = 0.097 and P = 0.026; 19p P = 0.04 and P = 0.002). 1q, 19p and co-polysomy were confirmed as risk factors conveyed unfavorable outcomes, which has been further validated in both anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors (AOGs) (P = 0.07, P = 0.028 and P = 0.054 for PFS; P = 0.007, P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 for OS, respectively) and glioblastomas with oligodendroglioma component (GBMOs) (P = 0.005, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001 for PFS; P = 0.136, P = 0.006 and P = 0.051 for OS, respectively). Based on chromosomes 1/19 co-deletion and co-polysomy, AOGs and GBMOs could be divided into three subgroups which harbored distinct prognosis (AOGs P &lt; 0.001 for PFS and P &lt; 0.001 for OS; GBMOs P &lt; 0.001 for PFS and P = 0.012 for OS). Chromosomes 1/19 polysomy are potential prognostic factors which confer unfavorable outcomes. The molecular prognostic grouping model based on chromosomes 1/19 co-polysomy and co-deletion better predicts prognosis and provides a more reliable information for treatment decision-making.</str>

      <str>Human cytochrome P-450s structurally related to 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible rabbit P-450 4 and 6 have been cloned from a human liver cDNA library. The human P-450 4 cDNA clone, hpP-450 4, and the human P-450 6 cDNA clone, hpP-450 6, were identified by hybridization to rabbit P-450 4 and P-450 6 cDNAs, respectively. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that hpP-450 4 is 83% and 75% homologous to rabbit P-450 4 and P-450 6 mRNAs, respectively, whereas hpP-450 6 is 79% and 72% homologous to rabbit P-450 6 and P-450 4, respectively. A comparison of DNA sequence of the two human cDNA clones shows they are 80% homologous. This is similar to the homology found between the cDNA sequences of rabbit P-450 4 and P-450 6. Northern blot analysis has shown that the human P-450 4 mRNA is approximately 3000 bases, while the human P-450 6 mRNA is 2600 bases in length. Clone hpP-450 4 preferentially hybridizes to TCDD-inducible rabbit P-450 4 and mouse P3-450 mRNAs, whereas hpP-450 6 preferentially hybridizes to TCDD-inducible rabbit P-450 6 and mouse P1-450 mRNAs. Both hpP-450 4 and hpP-450 6 recognize different genomic fragments, indicating that each is encoded by different genes. These results indicate the existence of at least two P-450 genes in humans that are highly homologous to the TCDD-inducible P-450s in rabbits and mice.</str>

      <str>Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is frequently cultured in patients with wound infections after shoulder surgery. The purpose of this study was to characterize the colonization of various anatomic locations with P. acnes in order to explain this clinical observation.</str>
      <str>Culture samples were collected from the skin overlying the shoulder, hip, and knee of 20 subjects (10 male, 10 female). Semi-quantitative cultures of P. acnes and Staphylococcus species were performed to define bacterial prevalence and burden at each site. The participants completed a questionnaire that assessed skin health, hygiene, and co-morbid medical conditions. Physical examination was performed to define local skin characteristics.</str>
      <str>Anterior and posterior acromial sites had a greater prevalence of P. acnes than the hip (anterior p=0.018; posterior p= 0.038) and knee (anterior p=0.0014; posterior p= 0.035) sites. The axilla had a greater prevalence of P. acnes than the knee (p=0.008). Males had a greater prevalence of P. acnes than females at the anterior (p=0.007) and posterior acromion sites (p=0.025). The burden of P. acnes at the anterior acromion (p=0.024), posterior acromion (p=0.035), and axilla (p=0.03) was greater than the mean burden at the hip.

      <str>During protein N-glycosylation, dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) is discharged in the lumenal monolayer of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dol-P-P is then cleaved to Dol-P by Dol-P-P phosphatase (DPPase). Studies with the yeast mutant cwh8Delta, lacking DPPase activity, indicate that recycling of Dol-P produced by DPPase contributes significantly to the pool of Dol-P utilized for lipid intermediate biosynthesis on the cytoplasmic leaflet. Whether Dol-P formed in the lumen diffuses directly back to the cytoplasmic leaflet or is first dephosphorylated to dolichol has not been determined. Incubation of sealed ER vesicles from calf brain with acetyl-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH(2), an N-glycosylatable peptide, to generate Dol-P-P in the lumenal monolayer produced corresponding increases in the rates of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and GlcNAc-P-P-Dol synthesis in the absence of CTP. No changes in dolichol kinase activity were observed. When streptolysin-O permeabilized CHO cells were incubated with an acceptor peptide, N-glycopeptide synthesis, requiring multiple cycles of the dolichol pathway, occurred in the absence of CTP. The results obtained with sealed microsomes and CHO cells indicate that Dol-P, formed from Dol-P-P, returns to the cytoplasmic leaflet where it can be reutilized for lipid intermediate biosynthesis, and dolichol kinase is not required for recycling. It is possible that the flip-flopping of the carrier lipid is mediated by a flippase, which would provide a mechanism for the recycling of Dol-P derived from Man-P-Dol-mediated reactions in N-, O-, and C-mannosylation of proteins, GPI anchor assembly, and the three Glc-P-Dol-mediated reactions in Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-P-P-Dol (DLO) biosynthesis.</str>

      <str>The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether or not the FABP2 gene polymorphism modulated obesity indices, hemodynamic factor, blood lipid factor, and insulin resistance markers through 12-week aerobic exercise training in abdominal obesity group of Korean mid-life women. A total of 243 abdominally obese subjects of Korean mid-life women voluntarily participated in aerobic exercise training program for 12 weeks. Polymerase Chain Reaction with Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was used to assess the FABP2 genotype of the participants (117 of AA homozygotes, 100 of AT heterozygotes, 26 of TT homozygotes). Prior to the participation of the exercise training program, baseline obesity indices, hemodynamic factor, blood lipid factor, and insulin resistance markers were measured. All the measurements were replicated following the 12-week aerobic exercise training program, and then the following results were found. After 12-week aerobic exercise training program, wild type (Ala54Ala) and mutant type (Ala54Thr+Thr54Thr) significantly decreased weight (P &gt; .001), BMI (P &gt; .001), %bf (P &gt; .001), waist circumference (P &gt; .001), WHR (P &gt; .001), muscle mass (wild type p &lt; .022; mutant type P &gt; .001), RHR (P &gt; .001), viseceral adipose area (wild type p &lt; .005; mutant type P &gt; .001), subcutaneous area (P &gt; .001), insulin (wild type p &lt; .005; mutant type P &gt; .001) and significantly increased VO2max (P &gt; .001). And wild type significantly decresed NEFA (P &gt; .05), glucose (P &gt; .05), OGTT 120min glucose (P &gt; .05) and significantly increased HDLC (p &gt; .005). Mutant type significantly decreased SBP (P &gt; .001), DBP (P &gt; .01), TC (P &gt; .01), LPL (P &gt; .05), LDL (P &gt; .001), HOMA index (P &gt; .01). The result of the present study represents that regular aerobic exercise training may beneficially prevent obesity index, blood pressure, blood lipids and insulin resistance markers independent of FABP Ala54Thr wild type and mutant type. </str>

      <str>Eosinophils have been involved in a wide spectrum of pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic conditions, with the development of cardiovascular complications in a significant proportion of hypereosinophilic patients.

      <str>In a consecutive cohort of patients, myonecrosis biomarkers were dosed at intervals from 6 to 48 h after PCI. Periprocedural myonecrosis was defined as troponin I increase by 3 times the ULN or by 50% of an elevated baseline value, whereas PMI as CKMB increase by 3 times the ULN or 50% of baseline.</str>

      <str>Six rat hepatic cytochromes P-450, named P-450IF-1-6, were purified from hepatic microsomes of immature female rats by high-performance liquid chromatography with anion-exchange, cation-exchange, and hydroxylapatite columns. The purified forms, except for P-450IF-4, gave a single protein-staining band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a minimum molecular weight of 50,000 for P-450IF-1, 49,000 for P-450IF-2, 47,000 for P-450IF-3, 53,500 for P-450IF-5, and 54,000 for P-450IF-6. The CO-reduced spectral maximum of these forms was at 450 nm for P-450IF-1, 448 nm for P-450IF-2, 451 nm for P-450IF-3, 449 nm for P-450IF-4, 449 nm for P-450IF-5, and 450 nm for P-450IF-6. All of these cytochromes had the low-spin state of heme in the oxidized form. P-450IF-4 had high metabolic activity for both benzphetamine and 7-ethoxycoumarin. P-450IF-5 had moderate activity toward 7-ethoxycoumarin. P-450IF-3 catalyzed the hydroxylation of testosterone at the 7 alpha-position effectively, but the other forms did not hydroxylate testosterone. Analysis of the NH2-terminal sequence showed that P-450IF-1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 differed structurally from each other. The sequences of P-450IF-1 and IF-2 were somewhat homologous, but the NH2-terminal sequences of the other forms were all different. Based on these results, we concluded that P-450IF-1 corresponded to one of the phenobarbital-inducible forms in male rat liver. P-450IF-2 was a female-specific form and its concentration was low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) starvation is highly notorious for limiting plant growth around the globe. To combat P-starvation, plants constantly sense the changes in their environment, and elicit an elegant myriad of plastic responses and rescue strategies to enhance P-solublization and acquisition from bound soil P-forms. Relative growth responses, P-solublization and P-acquisition ability of 14 diverse Brassica cultivars grown with sparingly soluble P-sources (Rock-P (RP) and Ca(3)(PO(4))(2) (TCP)) were evaluated in a solution culture experiment. Cultivars showed considerable genetic diversity in terms of biomass accumulation, concentration and contents of P and Ca in shoots and roots, P-stress factor (PSF) and P use efficiency. Cultivars showed variable P-stress tolerance, and cultivars depicting low PSF and high P-efficiency values were better adaptable to P-starvation. In experiment 2, after initial feeding on optimum nutrition for 12 d after transplanting (DAT), class-I (low P-tolerant (Oscar and Con-II)) and class-II (low P-sensitive (Gold Rush and RL-18)) cultivars were exposed to P-free environment for 25 d. All of the cultivars remobilized P from above ground parts to their roots during growth in P-free environment, the magnitude of which was variable in tested cultivars. P-concentrations ([P]s) at 37 DAT were higher in developing compared with developed leaves. Translocation of absorbed P from metabolically inactive to active sites in P-stressed plants may have helped class-I cultivars to establish a better rooting system, which provided a basis for enhanced P-utilization efficiency (PUE) and tolerance against P-stress. By supplying TCP and RP spatially separated from other nutrients in split root study, class-I cultivars were still able to mobilize RP and TCP more efficiently compared with class-II cultivars. To compare the growth behavior under P-stress, cultivars were grown in pots for 41 d after sowing, using a soil low in P (NaHCO(3)-extractable P = 3.97 mg/kg, Mehlich-III-extractable P = 6.13 mg/kg) with (+P = 60 mg P/kg soil) or without P addition (0P) in study 4. Tested cultivars showed genetic diversity in PUE, P-efficiency (PE), P-efficiency ratio (PER) and PSF. P-stress markedly reduced biomass and plant P contents. Cultivars that produced higher root biomass accumulated higher total P-contents (r= 0.98**), which in turn was related negatively to PSF (r=-0.95**) and positively to shoot and total biomass. PER and PE showed significant correlations with shoot P-contents and biomass. Cultivars depicting high PUE and PE, and low PSF values showed better growth behavior under low soil P-environment. Systematic analysis and deployment of the plant rescue traits underlying the nutrient acquisition, assimilation, utilization and remobilization under P-starvation will bring more sparingly soluble P into cropping systems and will help to scavenge more P from plant unavailable bound P reserves.</str>

      <str>A cDNA clone for the nitrate/nitrite-inducible cytochrome P-450 (P-450) of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (tentatively termed P-450dNIR) was isolated by an immunoscreening method. Sequence determination revealed a polypeptide of 403 amimo acid residues (Mr = 44,371), which was shown to contain the full-length sequence of the fungal P-450. The amino terminus region of the predicted sequence contained neither the signal-like, hydrophobic domain that is commonly observed in microsomal P-450s nor the tagging prosequence that is essential for localization of mitochondrial P-450s. Further, the sequence exhibited higher homologies against those of soluble bacterial P-450s, in particular P-450s of Streptomyces, rather than those of eukaryotic P-450s including yeast and fungal P-450s. These results are highly indicative that P-450dNIR is the first soluble P-450 derived from eukaryotic organisms. The unique features might be related to the novel function of P-450dNIR, which is involved in a dissimilatory reduction of nitrite by the fungus. P-450dNIR was classified into a new family, P-450LV, and the corresponding gene of the fungus was named CYP55.</str>

      <str>A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of biological type (early-moderate or late maturity) and implant status (estrogenic, combination, or nonimplanted; repeats included) on HCW (kg); LM area (cm2); 12th-rib fat thickness (fat thickness, cm); KPH (%), and intramuscular fat (%) at harvest, to provide inputs to an ongoing program for modeling beef cattle growth and carcass quality. Forty-three publications from 1982 to 2004 with consistent intramuscular fat data were evaluated. Two studies were undertaken: 1) with fat thickness as a covariate and 2) with BW as a covariate. The intercept-slope covariance estimate was not statistically different from 0 for LM area (P = 0.11), KPH (P = 0.19), and intramuscular fat (P = 0.74) in study 1, and for LM area (P = 0.44), fat thickness (P = 0.11), KPH (P = 0.19), and intramuscular fat (P = 0.74) in study 2; therefore, a reduced model without a covariance component was fitted for these carcass characteristics. A covariance component was fitted for HCW (P = 0.01, study 1 and P = 0.05, study 2) and for intramuscular fat (P = 0.05, study 2). In study 1, the results for maturity indicated differences between early-moderate and late maturity for HCW (P &lt; 0.01) and LM area (P &lt; 0.01) but no differences for KPH (P = 0.26) and intramuscular fat (P = 0.50); for implant status, an estrogenic or combination implant increased HCW by 2.9% (P = 0.27) or 4.8% (P &lt; 0.01), increased LM area by 3.2% (P = 0.23) or 6.3% (P &lt; 0.01), decreased intramuscular fat by 8.1% (P &lt; 0.01) or 5.4% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, and decreased KPH by 7.6% (P = 0.34) for estrogenic implants but increased KPH by 1.1% (P = 0.36) for combination implants, compared with nonimplanted steers. In study 2, the results at 600 kg of BW for implant status (implant or nonimplant) indicated no differences for HCW (P = 0.63) and LM area (P = 0.73), but there were differences for fat thickness (P &lt; 0.01), KPH (P &lt; 0.01), and intramuscular fat (P &lt; 0.01); the results for maturity (early-moderate or late maturity) indicated no differences for HCW (P = 0.94), but there were differences for LM area (P &lt; 0.01), fat thickness (P &lt; 0.01), KPH (P &lt; 0.01), and intramuscular fat (P &lt; 0.01). The difference between early-moderate and late maturity (studies 1 and 2) confirmed that frame size accounts for a substantial portion of the variation in carcass composition. Studies 1 and 2 also indicate that implant status had significant effects on carcass quality.</str>

      <str>An artificial photosynthetic reaction center consisting of a carotenoid (C), a dimesitylporphyrin (P), and a bis(heptafluoropropyl)porphyrin (P(F)), C-P-P(F) , and the related triad in which the central porphyrin has been metalated to give C-P(Zn)-P(F) have been synthesized and characterized by transient spectroscopy. These triads are models for amphipathic triads having a carboxylate group attached to the P(F) moiety; they are designed to carry out redox processes across lipid bilayers. Triad C-P-P(F) undergoes rapid singlet-singlet energy transfer between the porphyrin moieties, so that their excited states are in equilibrium. In benzonitrile, photoinduced electron transfer from the first excited singlet state of P and hole transfer from the first excited singlet state of P(F) yield the initial charge-separated state C-P(.) (+)-P(F) (.) (-). Subsequent hole transfer to the carotenoid moiety generates the final charge-separated state C(.) (+)-P-P(F) (.) (-), which has a lifetime of 1.1 mus and is formed with a quantum yield of 0.24. In triad C-P(Zn)-P(F) energy transfer from the P(Zn) excited singlet to the P(F) moiety yields C-P(Zn)-(1)P(F) . A series of electron-transfer reactions analogous to those observed in C-P-P(F) generates C(.) (+)-P(Zn)-P(F) (.) (-), which has a lifetime of 750 ns and is formed with a quantum yield of 0.25. Flash photolysis experiments in liposomes containing an amphipathic version of C-P(Zn)-P(F) demonstrate that the added driving force for photoinduced electron transfer in the metalated triad is useful for promoting electron transfer in the low-dielectric environment of artificial biological membranes. In argon-saturated toluene solutions of C-P-P(F) and C-P(Zn)-P(F) , charge separation is not observed and a considerable yield of triplet species is generated upon excitation of the porphyrin moieties. In both triads triplet energy localized in the P(F) moiety is channeled to the carotenoid chromophore by a triplet energy-transfer relay mechanism. Certain photophysical characteristics of these triads, including the sequential electron transfer and the triplet energy-transfer relay mechanism, are reminiscent of those observed in natural reaction centers of photosynthetic bacteria.</str>

      <str>The fractionation of phosphorus (P) in shallow Lake Maryout surficial sediments was investigated in order to understand its potential availability in relation to the eutrophication status of this lake. The rank order of P fractions was NaOH-P &gt; HCl-P &gt; NH(4)Cl-P &gt; BD-P. The metal oxide-bound P (NaOH-P) averaged 43% in this hypereutrophic lake and would be potentially available under low oxygen conditions. The highly available, loosely sorbed P (NH(4)Cl-P) represented 20% of the sedimentary inorganic P on average, while the reductant P (BD-P) averaged 15% and is also considered highly available under low oxygen conditions. The less available calcium-bound P (HCl-P) represented 22% of sedimentary inorganic P. Lake Maryout exhibits high potential for release of P from sediment in forms available to algae, which is undesirable for eutrophication control. The range of potentially available P in tested sediments was 1,541 to 3,990 mg/kg (ppm), a very high quantity capable of supporting algal blooms independent of external loading.</str>

      <str>The chemical composition of manure P is a key factor determining its potential bioavailability and susceptibility to runoff. The distribution of P forms in 13 dairy manures was investigated with sequential fractionation coupled with orthophosphate-releasing enzymatic hydrolysis. Among the 13 dairy manures, manure total P varied between 4100 and 18,300 mg kg(-1) dry matter (DM). Water-extractable P was the largest fraction, with inorganic phosphorus (P(i)) accounting for 12 to 44% of manure total P (1400-6800 mg kg(-1)) and organic phosphorus (P(o)) for 2 to 23% (130-1660 mg kg(-1)), respectively. In the NaHCO(3) fraction, P(i) varied between 740 and 4200 mg P kg(-1) DM (4-44% of total manure P), and P(o) varied between 340 and 1550 mg P kg(-1) DM (2-27% of total manure P). In the NaOH fraction, P(i) fluctuated around 200 mg P kg(-1) DM, and P(o) ranged from 130 to 630 mg P kg(-1) DM. Of the enzymatically hydrolyzable P(o) in the three fractions, phytate-like P dominated, measuring 26 to 605 mg kg(-1) DM, whereas monoester P and DNA-like P were relatively low and less variable. Although concentrations of various P forms varied considerably, significant correlations between manure total P and certain P forms were observed. For example, H(2)O-extracted P(i) was correlated with total manure P (R(2) = 0.62), and so was NaOH-extracted P(o) (R(2) = 0.81). Data also show that the amount of P released by a single extraction with sodium acetate (100 mM, pH 5.0) was equivalent to the sum of P in all three fractions (H(2)O-, NaHCO(3)-, and NaOH-extractable P). Thus, a single extraction by sodium acetate buffer could provide an efficient evaluation of plant-available P in animal manure, while the sequential fractionation approach provides more detailed characterization of manure P.</str>

      <str>Between August 1972 and September 1973, fish, crabs, and shellfish were collected from the lower Fraser River, its estuary, and selected areas of Georgia Strait in British Columbia. Samples were analyzed for aldrin, dieldrin, alpha- and gamma-chlordane, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, lindane, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's). Of these, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, heptachlor epoxide, and one PCB, Aroclor 1254, were detected in samples of many fish, crabs, and shellfish from the lower Fraser River and its estuary. Generally, compounds found in decreasing order of magnitude in samples from the Fraser River and its estuary were: PCB's, p,p'-DDE, heptachlor epoxide, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD. Greatest concentrations of these compounds occurred in biota from the waters adjacent to the City of Vancouver. With one exception, animals from Georgia Strait and those away from the immediate influence of Fraser River water contained no detectable levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons.</str>

Four seasonal 12-lead resting electrocardiograms were recorded at 2 mV/cm standardization and at 50 mm/s paper speed at intervals of three months. Electrocardiograms were recorded between the hours 10 to 12 AM. The difference between the maximum P-wave duration and minimum P-wave duration was calculated and defined as "P dispersion." There was a significant seasonal variation in the maximum P-wave duration (P = .001) and P dispersion (P = .001), with the longest maximum P-wave duration (121 +/- 16 ms) and P dispersion (41 +/- 7 ms) observed in winter and the shortest maximum P-wave duration (106 +/- 15 ms) and P dispersion (24 +/- 8 ms) observed in summer. The minimum P-wave duration did not show any significant seasonal variation. In conclusion, there exists a significant seasonal variation in the maximum P-wave duration and P dispersion in healthy patients. Seasonal variation of P dispersion resulted from the significant variation of maximum P-wave duration.</str>

      <str>Phytophthora infestans is one of the most destructive plant pathogens of potato and tomato globally. The pathogen is closely related to four other Phytophthora species in the 1c clade including P. phaseoli, P. ipomoeae, P. mirabilis and P. andina that are important pathogens of other wild and domesticated hosts. P. andina is an interspecific hybrid between P. infestans and an unknown Phytophthora species. We have sequenced mitochondrial genomes of the sister species of P. infestans and examined the evolutionary relationships within the clade. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the P. phaseoli mitochondrial lineage is basal within the clade. P. mirabilis and P. ipomoeae are sister lineages and share a common ancestor with the Ic mitochondrial lineage of P. andina. These lineages in turn are sister to the P. infestans and P. andina Ia mitochondrial lineages. The P. andina Ic lineage diverged much earlier than the P. andina Ia mitochondrial lineage and P. infestans. The presence of two mitochondrial lineages in P. andina supports the hybrid nature of this species. The ancestral state of the P. andina Ic lineage in the tree and its occurrence only in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Peru suggests that the origin of this species hybrid in nature may occur there. </str>

      <str>Mechanism of developmental suppression of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) in rat livers was studied using Western blots. The contents of phenobarbital (PB)-inducible P-450b and P-450e, expressed constitutively in livers, were higher in neonate than in adult rats. The contents were also 10 approximately 50 fold higher in hypophysectomized than in intact adult male rats. Administration of L-triiodothyronine (T3, 50 micrograms/kg) or human growth hormone (4 U/kg) reversed almost completely the increased amounts of P-450b and P-450e. T3-induced suppression was also observed on two other neonatal P-450s (P-450 6 beta-1 and P-448-H), which are expressed in neonatal periods in livers. The postnatal developmental profiles of hepatic P-450b were correlated inversely with that of serum free T3 level in rats reported (Walker et al. (1980) Pediat. Res. 14, 249). These results suggest, in addition to pituitary growth hormone (Yamazoe et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7423), the possible involvement of T3 on the suppressive regulation of PB-inducible and other neonatal P-450s.</str>

      <str>The competitive random coadsorption of dimers and monomers, with probabilities P(D) and P(M), such as P(D)+P(M)=1, respectively, is studied numerically by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Excluded volume and nearest-neighbor infinite repulsion between unlike species is considered. The subtle interplay between competitive coadsorption, jamming behavior and the emergency of percolation clusters is analyzed in detail. Taking P(M) as the single parameter of the model, five characteristic regions where the system exhibit different physical behavior can be identified: I) For P(M)&lt; or =P(M1) approximately equal to 0.4025(25) the standard percolation of dimers is observed; II) Within the interval P(M1)&lt;P(M)&lt;P(*)(M1) approximately equal to 0.4375(25) clusters of all species (monomers, dimers, and empty sites) are finite (nonpercolating); III) For P(*)(M1)&lt; or =P(M)&lt; or =P(*)(M2) approximately equal to 0.5425(25) the percolation of homogeneous clusters of empty sites is observed; IV) Within the interval P(*)(M2)&lt;P(M)&lt;P(M2) approximately equal to 0.5575(25), the system behaves as in Region II; and finally, V) For P(M2)&lt; or =P(M), one has the standard percolation of monomers.</str>

      <str>To analyze parameters that influence the risk of distant metastases after definitive radiotherapy.</str>
      <str>Between 1983 and 1997, 873 patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy and had follow-up for 2 years or more. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors that might influence the risk of distant metastases.</str>
      <str>The 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate was 86%. Univariate analyses revealed that the risk of distant metastases was significantly influenced by gender (p =.0092), primary site (p =.0023), T stage (p &lt;.0001), N stage (p &lt;.0001), overall stage (p &lt;.0001), level of nodal metastases in the neck (p &lt;.0001), histologic differentiation (p =.0096), control above the clavicles (p &lt;.0001), and time to locoregional recurrence (p &lt;.0001). Multivariate analysis of freedom from distant metastases revealed that gender (p =.0390), T stage (p &lt;.0001), N stage (p =.0060), nodal level (p &lt;.0001), and locoregional control (p &lt;.0001) significantly influenced this end point. Multivariate analysis revealed that gender (p =.0049), T stage (p &lt;.0001), N stage (p &lt;.0001), and locoregional control (p &lt;.0001) significantly influenced cause-specific survival.</str>
      <str>The risk of distant metastases after definitive radiotherapy is 14% at 5 years and is significantly influenced by gender, T stage, N stage, nodal level, and locoregional control.</str>

      <str>Conditionals in natural language are central to reasoning and decision making. A theoretical proposal called the Ramsey test implies the conditional probability hypothesis: that the subjective probability of a natural language conditional, P(if p then q), is the conditional subjective probability, P(q/p). We report three experiments on causal indicative conditionals and related counterfactuals that support this hypothesis. We measured the probabilities people assigned to truth table cases, P(pq), P(p notq), P( notpq) and P( notp notq). From these ratings, we computed three independent predictors, P(p), P(q/p) and P(q/ notp), that we then entered into a regression equation with judged P(if p then q) as the dependent variable. In line with the conditional probability hypothesis, P(q/p) was by far the strongest predictor in our experiments. This result is inconsistent with the claim that causal conditionals are the material conditionals of elementary logic. Instead, it supports the Ramsey test hypothesis, implying that common processes underlie the use of conditionals in reasoning and judgments of conditional probability in decision making.</str>

      <str>The aromatic compound p-cresol (4-methylphenol) has been found elevated in the urines of Italian autistic children up to 8 years of age. The present study aims at replicating these initial findings in an ethnically distinct sample and at extending them by measuring also the three components of urinary p-cresol, namely p-cresylsulfate, p-cresylglucuronate and free p-cresol. Total urinary p-cresol, p-cresylsulfate and p-cresylglucuronate were significantly elevated in 33 French autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases compared with 33 sex- and age-matched controls (p &lt; 0.05). This increase was limited to ASD children aged ≤8 years (p &lt; 0.01), and not older (p = 0.17). Urinary levels of p-cresol and p-cresylsulfate were associated with stereotypic, compulsive/repetitive behaviors (p &lt; 0.05), although not with overall autism severity. These results confirm the elevation of urinary p-cresol in a sizable set of small autistic children and spur interest into biomarker roles for p-cresol and p-cresylsulfate in autism.</str>

      <str>A total of 27 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated by transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TUV-P). A roller bar electrode was used for 13 patients and a roller loop electrode for 14. Therapeutic efficacy and complications of TUV-P were compared with those of transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) performed before TUV-P was started (24 patients). The improvements in subjective symptom scores and objective voiding parameters after 3 months were not significantly different between the TUV-P and TUR-P groups. Furthermore, the improvements were similar between TUV-P using the roller bar and the roller loop. No patients treated by TUV-P had TUR syndrome or received blood transfusion, while blood transfusion was performed in 4 patients treated by TUR-P. Postoperative duration of urethral catheterization and hospital stay was significantly shorter in the TUV-P group than in the TUR-P group. The operative time for TUV-P (roller bar) was 1.6 min per g. preoperative prostate volume, while that for TUV-P (roller loop) and TUR-P was 2.1 and 1.9 min/g, respectively. From our experience, TUV-P was as effective as TUR-P for relieving bladder outlet obstruction with fewer complications. Furthermore, the operative time could be shortened with a roller loop.</str>

      <str>The proportion of polyploid plant species increases at higher latitudes, and it has been suggested that original postglacial Arctic immigrants of some large groups, including grasses, were polyploid. We analyzed noncoding nuclear and chloroplast DNA of all North American diploid Puccinellia (Poaceae) and a subset of arctic polyploids to hypothesize evolutionary relationships among diploids and to evaluate the parentage of polyploids. Diploids formed three lineages: one uniting arctic species P. arctica and P. banksiensis; a second comprising arctic species P. tenella, P. alaskana, P. vahliana, and P. wrightii; and a third uniting the two temperate species P. lemmonii and P. parishii. The arctic species P. angustata (hexaploid) and P. andersonii (primarily octoploid) apparently derive from the P. arctica-P. banksiensis lineage based on ITS and chloroplast sequences, and share an ancestor with arctic triploid/tetraploid P. phryganodes based on nrDNA sequences. Sequence comparisons also suggest tetraploid P. bruggemannii evolved from two arctic lineages: P. vahliana-P. wrightii and P. arctica-P. banksiensis. These patterns and the predominance of arctic rather than temperate diploid species support the idea that diploid Puccinellia recolonized the Arctic from northern glacial refugia like Beringia, and also formed stabilized polyploid hybrids during these refugial events or subsequently during postglacial colonization.</str>

      <str>The role of multidrug resistance and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the development of drug-resistant tumor cells has been extensively studied. As more knowledge on the physiological functions of P-gp has accumulated, the effects of P-gp modulation on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of many drugs have become apparent. Solid organ transplant recipients receive numerous medications that are substrates for P-gp. The objective of this review is to discuss the effects of P-gp modulation on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetic alterations may occur in drug absorption since P-gp is in the small bowel, in drug distribution since P-gp functions in the blood-brain barrier, in drug metabolism since P-gp and cytochrome P450 3A have linked functions, and in drug elimination since P-gp is in the bile canaliculi and renal tubules. A link between P-gp and organ rejection has been speculated since upregulation of the P-gp pump may restrict immunosuppressant drug entry into immunocompetent cells. A further understanding of P-gp regulation upon chronic exposure to P-gp substrates and inhibitors and the potential administration of selective P-gp inhibitors will enhance our ability to use potent immunosuppressive drugs in organ transplant patients.</str>

Women were younger (mean age = 34.82 y) than men (36.87 y; p = 0.003), with a peak in the 4th decade. Clinical event was a TIA in 14.2 p. 100, a stroke in 51.7 p. 100; it concerned the anterior circulation in 64.5 p. 100, posterior circulation in 25 p. 100, multiple territories in 10.5 p. 100. History of TIA, cervical-cranial pain or Horner syndrome suggestive of dissection, pregnancy or post-partum were found respectively in 60 (20.3 p. 100), 34 (11.1 p. 100) and 13 (9.3 p. 100) cases. Risk factors concerned 87.2 p. 100 of patients, mainly smoking (55.1 p. 100), oral contraceptive (53 p. 100), hyperlipemia (35 p. 100), and were more frequent in case of atheroma and lacunar stroke (p &lt; 0.0000). Etiology, according to TOAST classification, was: atheroma (8.4 p. 100), cardioembolism (8.7 p. 100), small-artery disease (7.1 p. 100), dissection (15.5 p. 100), other determined causes (11.1 p. 100), multiple causes (5.7 p. 100), undetermined cause (34.8 p. 100). Septal pathology was found 34 times. Patients whose stroke remained unexplained were younger (33.7 y vs 37.7, p = 0.002), had less risk factors (p &lt; 0.0000), had more TIA (p = 0.005), more often in the carotid territory (p = 0.008), had a better prognosis (p = 0.01), and showed more often emboli at angiography (p = 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 33 months (median = 19), 21 recurrent strokes occurred and 6 patients died. 134 (46 p. 100) patients had no sequelae, 101 (34.7 p. 100) minor disability, 42 (14.4 p. 100) major sequelae. These results, compared to the main studies of the literature, suggest the interest of common definition criteria and classification of etiologies. In practice, hierarchisation of investigations may be proposed, and vascular risk factors should be tracked in young patients. In patients whose stroke remains unexplained, further studies, as atrial vulnerability, are needed.</str>

      <str>A detailed theoretical investigation for the ion-molecule reaction of HCN (+) with C 2H 2 is performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,2pd) (single-point) levels. Possible energetically allowed reaction pathways leading to various low-lying dissociation products are probed. It is shown that eight dissociation products P 1 (H 2C 3N (+)+H), P 2 (CN+C 2H 3 (+)), P 3 (HC 3N (+)+H 2), P 4 (HCCCNH (+)+H), P 5 (H 2NCCC (+)+H), P 6 (HCNCCH (+)+H), P 7 (C 2H 2 (+)+HCN), and P 8 (C 2H 2 (+)+HNC) are both thermodynamically and kinetically accessible. Among the eight dissociation products, P 1 is the most abundant product. P 7 and P 3 are the second and third feasible products but much less competitive than P 1 , followed by the almost negligible product P 2 . Other products, P 4 (HCCCNH (+)+H), P 5 (HCNCCH (+)+H), P 6 (H 2NCCC (+)+H), and P 8 (C 2H 2 (+)+HNC) may become feasible at high temperatures. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the reaction HCN (+) + C 2H 2 are all lower than the reactant in energy, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured large rate constant at room temperature. The present calculation results may provide a useful guide for understanding the mechanism of HCN (+) toward other pi-bonded molecules.</str>

      <str>We have purified two distinct isoforms of mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 from beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF)-induced rat liver to greater than 85% homogeneity and characterized their molecular and catalytic properties. One of these isoforms showing an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa is termed P-450mt1 and the second isoform with 54-kDa molecular mass is termed P-450mt2. Cytochrome P-450mt2 comigrates with similarly induced microsomal P-450c (the major beta-NF-inducible form) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and cross-reacts with polyclonal antibody monospecific for cytochrome P-450c. Cytochrome P-450mt2, however, represents a distinct molecular species since it failed to react with a monoclonal antibody to P-450c and produced V8 protease fingerprints different from P-450c. Cytochrome P-450mt1, on the other hand, did not show any immunochemical homology with P-450c or P-450mt2 as well as partially purified P-450 from control mitochondria. Electrophoretic comparisons and Western blot analysis show that both P-450mt1 and P-450mt2 are induced forms not present in detectable levels in control liver mitochondria. A distinctive property of mitochondrial P-450mt1 and P-450mt2 was that their catalytic activities could be reconstituted with both NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase as well as mitochondrial specific ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase electron transfer systems, while P-450c showed exclusive requirement for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Cytochromes P-450mt1 and P-450mt2 were able to metabolize xenobiotics like benzo(a)pyrene and dimethyl benzanthracene at rates only one-tenth with cytochrome P-450c. Furthermore, P-450mt1, P-450mt2, as well as partially purified P-450 from control liver, but not P-450c, showed varying activities for 25- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3. These results provide evidence for the presence of at least two distinct forms of beta-NF-inducible cytochrome P-450 in rat hepatic mitochondria.</str>

      <str>Two forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450), designated P-450 k-1 and P-450 k-2, have been purified about 100-fold from rat kidney cortex microsomes. P-450 k-1 and P-450 k-2 have monomeric molecular weights of 51,500 and 52,000, respectively, on sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Absolute spectra of the oxidized forms indicate that P-450 k-1 is largely in the low-spin state and partly in the high-spin state, and that P-450 k-2 is essentially all in the former. The absorption maxima in reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra are at 450.5 and 451 nm with P-450 k-1 and P-450 k-2, respectively. The two P-450s catalyze the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of fatty acids such as caprate, laurate, myristate, and palmitate, although P-450 k-1 exhibits a higher specific activity with all fatty acids tested. In addition, P-450 k-1 is capable of hydroxylating prostaglandin (PG) A1 and A2 at the omega-position, whereas P-450 k-2 has no activity toward PGs. These activities are all stimulated by addition of cytochrome b5. The two P-450s give different peptide map patterns when partially digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or papain.</str>

The enzyme has a molecular mass of 54 kDa, CO-maximum 448 nm is characterized by a high spin state; the rate of 4-aminobiphenyl hydroxylation is 54 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450d (37 degrees C), those, of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation and benz (a) pyrene oxidation are 1 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450d (22 degrees C) and 2 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450d (37 degrees C), respectively. The properties of cytochrome P-450d were compared to those of cytochrome P-450c isolated from 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats. The yield of these cytochromes under the conditions used (10% P-450d from isosafrol-induced microsomes and 15% P-450c from 3-methylcholanthrene-induced microsomes) was relatively high. Antibodies to cytochromes P-450d and P-450c were obtained. Using rocket immunoelectrophoresis the percentage of these hemoprotein forms in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced (P-450d-20%, P-450c-70%) and isosafrol-induced rat liver microsomes (P-450d-50%, P-450c-15%) was determined.</str>

      <str>The urinary metabolites of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD), and 1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene in female hamsters are reported. The principal metabolite of both DDT and DDD is 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid. DDT- and DDD-treated animals also excreted small amounts of DDD, 1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethene, 2-hydroxy-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetic acid, and 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethanol. 1-Chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene is metabolized to afford significant amounts of 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetic acid, 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethanol, 2-hydroxy-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetic acid, 2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)acetaldehyde, and 1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethan-1,2-diol. These results indicate that the metabolic disposition of DDT in the hamster, a species refractory to DDT tumorigenicity, is very similar to that observed previously in the mouse, a species sensitive to DDT tumorigenicity. The one exception is that the hamster is not nearly as efficient as the mouse in converting DDT to 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene, a metabolite that is tumorigenic in both species.</str>

      <str>Genomic DNA of Paulownia fortunei, P. kawakamii and P. taiwaniana were amplified with 10-base primers of arbitrary sequences using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 351 DNA fragments were amplified from 23 primers and of these 265 fragments (75.5%) were polymorphic. Almost all of the PCR-amplified products of P. taiwaniana were shared by either P. fortunei or P. kawakamii, or both, and the number of polymorphic fragments shared by P. taiwaniana and P. fortunei was about equivalent to those shared by P. taiwaniana and P. kawakamii. Restriction fragments of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) purified from Paulownia species and from reciprocal crosses between P. fortunei and P. kawakamii were analyzed. Restriction enzyme SalI-digested cpDNA showed an identical pattern in both P. kawakamii and P. taiwaniana. These results further support the hypothesis that P. taiwaniana is the natural hybrid between P. fortunei and P. kawakamii and that the maternal parent of P. taiwaniana is P. kawakamii. </str>

      <str>Six simple sequence repeat (SSR)-enriched genome libraries from Pythium aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, and P. cryptoirregulare were constructed to develop SSR markers. One hundred six SSR primer pairs for P. aphanidermatum, 73 for P. cryptoirregulare, and 82 for P. irregulare were initially identified. After examining primers, the most polymorphic and reproducible SSR markers were selected for each Pythium species; 14 in P. aphanidermatum, 21 in P. irregulare, and 22 in P. cryptoirregulare. Analysis of isolates from each Pythium species using SSR markers showed the high degree of gene diversity and polymorphic information content (PIC) value in the three species. The average number of alleles was 3.5-5.3 in the three Pythium species. Seven SSR loci from P. cryptoirregulare and P. irregualre showed the distinct genetic separations of P. irregualre complex isolates. SSR markers identified for the three Pythium target species were highly transferable to other closely related Pythium species. Cross-amplification was found in all SSR markers between P. cryptoirregulare and P. irregulare. SSR loci were successfully amplified by direct PCR from mycelia of P. aphanidermatum, P. cryptoirregulare, and P. irregulare. These newly developed SSR markers can be used for population genetic studies and monitoring the movement of isolates in crop production systems or in nature.</str>

Serum P-III-P was increased (greater than 15 micrograms/l) in 38 of 44 (86%) patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, in 6 of 20 (30%) with fatty liver, in 1 of 13 (8%) with non-alcoholic fatty liver, and in 3 of 14 (21%) with other chronic liver diseases. Median serum P-III-P was almost three times higher in alcoholic liver cirrhosis than in alcoholic fatty liver (p less than 0.001). Serum P-III-P was increased in three of six patients with alcoholic fatty liver and periportal fibrosis. In the total material (n = 91), a statistically significant negative correlation between serum P-III-P and albumin (r = -0.71, p less than 0.001) and Normotest (r = -0.63, p less than 0.001), respectively, and a positive correlation between serum P-III-P and bilirubin (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001) were found.

      <str>The taxonomic status of Pinus henryi, a rare species endemic to China, is still ambiguous. In this study, the genetic relationships among P. henryi and its congeners (P. tabulaeformis, P. tabulaeformis var. mukdensis, and P. massoniana) were revealed using multiplexed microsatellite markers, including chloroplast microsatellites, nuclear microsatellites, and expressed sequence tag microsatellites. The results refute the hypothesis that P. henryi is a subspecies of P. tabulaeformis or P. massoniana and support the suggestion that it may be a distinct species closely related to P. tabulaeformis.</str>

      <str>Electron paramagnetic resonance studies have been carried out on two species of cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc and P-45011beta) purified from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria. The g values of the steroid-bound cytochromes in the high spin form were determined at 4.2 degrees K to be 8.07, 3.60 and 1.70 for P-450scc and 8.00, 3.65 and 1.71 for P-45011beta. The E/D values were estimated to be 0.103 for P-450scc and 0.099 for P-45011beta. Either high spin P-450 was converted into the low spin form by the treatment with an NADPH dependent electron donating system and subsequent gel filtration in order to remove the steroid. The g values of the low spin ferric cytochromes were 2.423, 2.247 and 1.914 for P-450scc and 2.430, 2.251 and 1.919 for P-45011beta at 77 degrees K. The values for magnitude of delta/gamma, magnitude of V/gamma and k were 5.69, 5.21 and 1.11 for P-450scc and 5.94, 5.38 and 1.16 for P-45011beta. These studies indicate that there are some differences in the ferric heme environment between P-450scc and P-45011beta.</str>

      <str>This study was done to identify pain perception (P-PER) by nurses and pain expression (P-EXP) by patients in critical care units (ICUs) and degree of agreement between nurses' P-PER and patients' P-EXP.</str>
      <str>Nurses' P-PER was measured with a self-administered questionnaire completed by 99 nurses working in ICUs during May, 2013. Patients' P-EXP was measured with the Critical Care Non-Verbal Pain Scale through observations of 31 ICU patients during nine nursing procedures (NPs) performed between May and July, 2013.</str>
      <str>Nurses' P-PER was from 4.49 points for nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion to 0.83 for blood pressure (BP) measurement based on a 9-point scale, Patients' P-EXP was 4.48 points for NGT to 0.18 for BP measurement based on a 10-point scale. Eight NPs except oral care showed higher scores for nurses' P-PER than for patients' P-EXP. Position change (p=.019), subcutaneous injection (p&lt;.001), blood sugar test (p&lt;.001), and BP measurement (p&lt;.001) showed significant differences between nurses' P-PER and patients' P-EXP.</str>
      <str>Nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion was scored highest by both nurses and patients. Eight NPs except 'oral care' showed nurses' P-PER was higher or similar to patients' P-EXP, which indicates that nurses may overestimate procedural pain experienced by patients.</str>

      <str>Two constitutive forms of cytochrome P-450, designated P-450ib and P-450ic, were purified from intestinal mucosa microsomes of untreated rabbits. P-450ib and P-450ic have minimal molecular weights of 56 000 and 49 000, respectively, as determined by calibrated sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The CO-reduced difference spectral maximum of cytochrome P-450ib is at 450 nm and P-450ic is at 451 nm. Both the cytochromes preferentially demethylate aminopyrine, benzphetamine and N,N-dimethylaniline in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Cytochrome P-450ib has absorption maxima at 417, 535 and 573 nm in the oxidized form, indicating that this cytochrome is in a low-spin state. Ouchterlony double-diffusion studies show that cytochrome P-450ib does not cross-react with antisera against liver cytochrome P-450LM2 purified from phenobarbital-treated rabbits, but P-450ic cross-reacts with spur formation. Unlike cytochrome P-450ib, P-450ic is very similar, if not identical, to liver cytochrome P-450LM2 on the basis of its molecular weight, spectral properties, catalytic activities and immunochemical properties.</str>

All samples contained p,p'-DDE, but only several contained p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDT. The concentrations of p,p'-DDE were 31 microgram/l in the beginning of lactation and 53 microgram/l at later time intervals. The concentration ranges in both groups overlap almost completely and the difference in the mean values is not significant. Serum samples from 35 mothers and cord blood were also analyzed. All samples contained p,p'-DDE, the concentrations being 18 microgram/l and 6.8 microgram/l in the mothers' and cord blood serum, respectively. Serum samples of 24 non-pregnant women contained the same amount of p,p'-DDE (20 microgram/l) as mothers' sera. All samples were collected in a continental town of Croatia (Yugoslavia) between 1977 and 1979. The concentrations of DDT residues were determined by gas chromatography, and two methods for extraction from milk were used and compared.</str>

      <str>To compare the incidences of anemia, osteoporosis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after the application of different endocrine therapies in patients with prostate cancer.</str>
      <str>Totally 125 patients aged 58 to 84 years with biopsy-confirmed local prostate cancer were recruited between September 2008 and September 2010. Of them 52 treated with orchiectomy (castration group) and 73 with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (goserelin acetate 3.6mg/month) combined with androgen antagonist (bicalutamide 50mg/d) for at least 12 months (hormone group), but without blood transfusion or erythropoietin. Changes in total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), bone mineral density (BMD) and gastrointestinal symptom rating scales (GSRS) were recorded and analyzed before treatment and 12 months after the initiation of treatment.</str>
      <str>In the castration group, after 12 months, TT (P=0.0007), FT (P=0.0003), PSA (P=0.0006), Hb (P=0.0001), RBC (P=0.020), Hct (P=0.016), Z-score of lumbar spine (P=0.008), and femoral neck (P=0.004) decreased significantly, and GSRS (P=0.029) increased significantly. In hormone group, after 12 months, TT (P=0.0008), FT (P=0.0006), PSA (P=0.0006), Hb (P=0.0003), RBC (P=0.0001), Hct (P=0.0002), Z-score of lumbar spine (P=0.002), femoral neck (P=0.0002), and RDW (P=0.045) decreased significantly, and GSRS (P=0.010) increased significantly. After 12 months, TT (P=0.004), FT (P=0.012), PSA (P=0.007), Hb (P=0.016), Z-score of lumbar spine (P=0.033), and femoral neck (P=0.015) in hormone group were significantly lower than in the castration group, while GSRS (P=0.027) in hormone group was significantly higher than in the castration group. The incidences of anemia (P=0.006), osteoporosis (P=0.009), and IBS (P=0.022) were significantly different between these two groups. The serum level of testosterone was positively correlated with Hb, RBC, Hct, and BMD in both groups (P=0.039). Negative linear correlations could be seen between serum level of testosterone and GSRS in both groups (P=0.021), and between serum level of testosterone and RDW in medical group only (P=0.044).</str>
      <str>The endocrine therapies, particularly maximal androgen blockage, in patients with prostate cancer can be associated with anemia, osteoporosis, and IBS.</str>

      <str>N-terminal procollagen-III peptide (P-III-P) has been considered a marker of fibrogenesis and inflammatory activity of the liver. We measured the P-III-P serum levels in 83 cirrhotic patients fully characterized from a clinical and laboratory point of view. Cirrhotic patients had significantly higher P-III-P serum levels than controls (P &lt; 0.0001). Of the cirrhotic patients 73.5% had increased P-III-P. A significant negative correlation was found between P-III-P and transaminases, and patients with normal values of alanine amino-transferase had higher P-III-P serum levels than those with increased values (P = 0.03). On the other hand, no significant association was found with portal hypertension, Child classes, or alcoholic liver disease. No one independent factor appears to be responsible for the increase in P-III-P. The measurement of serum P-III-P is of little if any use in the evaluation of cirrhotic patients.</str>

      <str>To assess the association between serum lipids and diabetic retinopathy (DR).</str>
      <str>Sixty-one diabetic patients without retinopathy(NDR), 55 diabetic patients with non-proliferative retinopathy(NPDR) and 75 diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy (PDR) according to ETDRS grading scale were enrolled in this study. Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride values were compared between the groups.</str>
      <str>The groups were well-balanced in terms of age and gender (P=0.071, P=0.265 respectively). The mean HbA1c values were significantly lower in NDR group than the NPDR and PDR groups (P=0.004, P=0.009 respectively). Mean total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, HDL and VLDL levels were not significantly different between the groups (P=0.693, P=0.774, P=0.644, P=0.910 and P=0.967 respectively, one way ANOVA). Mean total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, HDL and VLDL levels were not significantly different between the patients with ME and patients without ME (P=0.622, P=0.113, P=0.955, P=0.735 and P=0.490 respectively, t-test).

      <str>Six flying fox species, genus Pteropus (four from the Philippines) were investigated using complete cytochrome b gene sequences (1140 bp) to infer their evolutionary relationships. The DNA sequences generated via polymerase chain reaction were analyzed using the neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. We estimated that the first evolutionary event among these Pteropus species occurred approximately 13.90 +/- 1.49 MYA. Within this short period of evolutionary time we further hypothesized that the ancestors of the flying foxes found in the Philippines experienced a subsequent diversification forming two clusters in the topology. The first cluster is composed of P. pumilus (Philippine endemic), P. speciosus (restricted in western Mindanao) with P. scapulatus, while the second one comprised P. vampyrus and P. dasymallus species based on the analysis from first and second codon positions. Consistently, all phylogenetic analyses divulged close association of P. dasymallus with P. vampyrus contradicting the previous report categorizing P. dasymallus under subniger species group with P. pumilus. P. speciosus, and P. hypomelanus. The Philippine endemic species (P. pumilus) is closely linked with P. speciosus. The representative samples of P. vampyrus showed a large genetic distance of 1.87%. The large genetic distance between P. dasymallus and P. hypomelanus, P. pumilus and P. speciosus denotes a distinct species group.</str>

      <str>The beta-casein derived phosphopeptide, Glu-Glu-Ser(P)-Glu-Glu-Ser-Ile-Thr-NHMe and two derivatives in which the Ser(P)-residue is replaced by the Thr(P)- and Tyr(P)-residue have been compared for their susceptibility to phosphorylation by casein kinase-1. While both the Ser(P)- and Thr(P)-peptides are good substrates with similar kinetic constants, the Tyr(P)-peptide is a substrate as poor as the unphosphorylated derivative EEEEESIT, exhibiting a 21-fold higher Km and 6-fold lower Vmax values. While prior dephosphorylation of the Ser(P)-peptide caused a marked loss in its phosphoacceptor capacity, prior dephosphorylation of the Tyr(P)-peptide caused no significant change in its poor phosphoacceptor capacity. Thus the order of efficiency of phosphoaminoacids as specificity determinants for casein kinase-1 was found to be Ser(P)=Thr(P) much greater than Tyr(P) and this order is markedly different from Tyr(P) greater than Ser(P) much greater than Thr(P) which was previously established for casein kinase-2 [Meggio et al.

      <str>Human paragonimiasis is caused by nine species of Paragonimus, namely, P. westermani, P. africanus, P. heterotremus, P. kellicotti, P. mexicanus, P. siamensis, P. skrjabini, P. skrjabini miyazakii, and P. uterobilateralis. Cerebral or spinal involvements are most common in P. westermani, and can also occur in P. skrjabini, P. skrjabini miyazakii, and P. mexicanus. In P. westermani, cerebral paragonimiasis comprises about 45% of all extrapulmonary paragonimiasis cases, and accounts for about 1% of all paragonimiasis patients. In cerebral paragonimiasis, seizure, headache, visual disturbance, and motor and sensory disturbances are the five major clinical symptoms. The most commonly performed diagnostic procedures for cerebral infections are serological tests to detect circulating antibodies or antigens using ELISA or immunoblotting, and radiological examinations, including plain skull x-rays, brain CT, and MR scans. The drug of choice is praziquantel at the dose of 25mg/kg three times daily for 2-3 days. In severe infections, a second set of treatment may be needed. Triclabendazole can be used in P. uterobilateralis, P. mexicanus, and P. skrjabini infections with the dose of 10mg/kg twice a day; however, its efficacy in P. westermani infection, in particular cerebral infections, remains to be elucidated. </str>

      <str>The kinetics of phosphine substitution in CpRu(PAr3)2Cl by PMePh2 under pseudo-first order conditions in CDCl3 have been measured for PAr3 = PPh3, 1a, PPh2(p-tol), 1b, P(p-tol)3, 1c, P(p-CH3OC6H4)3, 1d, and P(p-FC6H4)3), 1e. Activation parameters characteristic of a dissociative pathway (ΔH(†) = 110-124 ± 2 kJ mol(-1), ΔS(†) = 16-44 ± 5-12 J mol(-1) K(-1)) are observed for all five compounds. The rate of substitution in CpRu(PAr3)2Cl (1a) and CpRu[P(p-FC6H4)3]2Cl (1e) is independent of added chloride ion and decreases in the presence of excess PAr3, however, the rate of substitution in CpRu[P(p-CH3OC6H4)3]2Cl (1d) is first order in added chloride ion and is less dependent on added PAr3. A mechanism involving [CpRu(PAr3)2(PMePh2)](+)[Cl](-) intermediates contributes to the substitution in 1b-d. </str>

      <str>We consider the classes M(p)  (1 &lt; p &lt; ∞) of holomorphic functions on the open unit disk 𝔻 in the complex plane. These classes are in fact generalizations of the class M introduced by Kim (1986). The space M (p) equipped with the topology given by the metric ρ p defined by ρp (f, g) = ||f - g|| p = (∫0(2π) log(p) (1 + M(f - g)(θ))(dθ/2π))(1/p), with f, g ∈ M (p) and Mf(θ) = sup 0 ⩽ r&lt;1 ⁡|f(re(iθ))|, becomes an F-space. By a result of Stoll (1977), the Privalov space N(p)  (1 &lt; p &lt; ∞) with the topology given by the Stoll metric d p is an F-algebra. By using these two facts, we prove that the spaces M(p) and N(p) coincide and have the same topological structure. Consequently, we describe a general form of continuous linear functionals on M(p) (with respect to the metric ρp). Furthermore, we give a characterization of bounded subsets of the spaces M(p). Moreover, we give the examples of bounded subsets of M(p) that are not relatively compact.</str>

      <str>Penicillium coffeae is described as a novel endophyte isolated from a Coffea arabica L. plant in Hawaii. The species is slow growing with short, vesiculate, monoverticillate conidiophores. Phylogenetic analysis using three loci shows that P. coffeae forms a strongly supported clade with P. fellutanum, P. charlesii, P. chermesinum, P. indicum, P. phoeniceum and P. brocae. Phenotypic ally these species are quite similar but can be distinguished. The EF-1alpha gene from P. fellutanum, P. charlesii, P. chermesinum and P. indicum lack introns, P. coffeae and P. phoeniceum have a previously unknown intron at codon 20 and P. brocae and P. thiersii isolates have a single intron at codon 26. The most parsimonious interpretation of intron changes on the strongly supported phylogenetic tree requires the gain of a novel intron at position 20 and loss of intron 26 to arrive at the current distribution of introns in this gene. This is one of only a few examples of intron gain in genes.</str>

      <str>Sediments from two lakes, the meso-to-eutrophic Volvi and the hypertrophic Koronia, located in N. Greece were examined on the basis of P-fractionation. In both lakes, the rank order of P-fractions was HCl-P &gt; NaOH-P &gt; BD-P &gt; NH4Cl-P. The loosely sorbed phosphorus (NH4Cl-P) represented &lt; 1% of the sedimentary inorganic phosphorus, while the reductant phosphorus (BD-P) ranged 5-6%. The calcium bound phosphorus (HCl-P) showed considerable contribution (59-74%) to the sedimentary inorganic P-loads. The metal oxide bound phosphorus (NaOH-P) was higher in the hypertrophic (30-35%) than in the meso-to-eutrophic system (19-28%). Fine-sized sediments exhibited significantly higher concentrations of HCl-P in Volvi and NH4Cl-P in Koronia. Sampling month had significant effect in variance of most P-fractions and other sediment features in both lakes. Use was also made of multivariate statistics to identify the factors which influence the sedimentary phosphorus. NaOH-P was the most reactive fraction in Lake Volvi. Iron compounds and organic matter seem to play a significant role in regulating this labile P-budget. NH4Cl-P was the more reactive fraction in Lake Koronia which was influenced by sedimentation of P-absorbed on clay/silt fine particles.</str>

      <str>1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (or p,p'-DDT) is one of the most persistent pesticides. It is resistant to breakdown in nature and cause the water contamination problem. In this work, a major objective was to demonstrate the application of N-doped TiO2 in degradation and mineralization of the p,p'-DDT under UV and visible light in aqueous solution. The N-doped TiO2 nanopowders were prepared by a simple modified sol-gel procedure using diethanolamine (DEA) as a nitrogen source. The catalyst characteristics were investigated using XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. The adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation of p,p'-DDT using the synthesized N-doped TiO2 under UV and visible light were conducted in a batch photocatalytic experiment. The kinetics and p,p'-DDT degradation performance of the N-doped TiO2 were evaluated. Results show that the N-doped TiO2 can degrade p,p'-DDT effectively under both UV and visible lights. The rate constant of the p,p'-DDT degradation under UV light was only 0.0121 min(-1), whereas the rate constant of the p,p'-DDT degradation under visible light was 0.1282 min(-1). Under visible light, the 100% degradation of p,p'-DDT were obtained from N-doped TiO2 catalyst. The reaction rate of p,p'-DDT degradation using N-doped TiO2 under visible light was sixfold higher than that under UV light. According to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, the adsorption equilibrium constant (K) for the N-doped TiO2 under visible light was 0.03078 L mg(-1), and the apparent reaction rate constant (k) was 1.3941 mg L(-1)-min. Major intermediates detected during the p,p'-DDT degradation were p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDD. Results from this work can be applied further for the breakdown of p,p'-DDT molecule in the real contaminated water using this technology. </str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) flow from deposits through agriculture to waterways leads to eutrophication and depletion of P reserves. Therefore, P must be recycled. Low and unpredictable plant availability of P in residues is considered to be a limiting factor for recycling. We identified the determinants for the plant-availability of P in agrifood residues. We quantified P in Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and in field soil fractions with different plant availabilities of P as a response to manure and sewage sludge with a range of P capture and hygienization treatments. P was more available in manure and in sludge, when it was captured biologically or with a moderate iron (Fe)/P (1.6), than in NPK. Increasing rate of sludge impaired P recovery and high Fe/P (9.8) prevented it. Anaerobic digestion (AD) reduced plant-availability at relevant rates. The recovery of P was increased in AD manure via composting and in AD sludge via combined acid and oxidizer. P was not available to plants in the sludge hygienized with a high calcium/P. Contrary to assumed knowledge, the recyclability of P in appropriately treated residues can be better than in NPK. The prevention of P sorption in soil by organic substances in fertilizers critically enhances the recyclability of P. </str>

      <str>Being downstream targets of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, serine/threonine kinase AKT, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and oncogenesis. This study was to investigate the activation and prognostic values of AKT, NF-kappaB and STAT3 in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis and estrogen receptor (ER) expression.</str>
      <str>The expression of phosphatized AKT (p-AKT), NF-kappaB (p-NF-kappaB) and STAT3 (p-STAT3), and the expression of EGFR, PTEN, HER-2, and Ki67 in tissue samples from 130 breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis and ER expression were detected by immunohistochemistry.</str>
      <str>The activity of AKT (p-AKT) and NF-kappaB (p-NF-kappaB) were correlated to HER-2 overexpression (P=0.023 and P=0.017) and histological grade of breast cancer (P=0.035 and P=0.004). The expression of p-AKT, p-NF-kappaB and p-STAT3 had no correlation to tumor size, EGFR overexpression, and proliferation index assessed by Ki67. The expression of p-AKT was positively correlated to that of p-NF-kappaB (r=0.43, P&lt;0.001) and negatively correlated to that of p-PTEN (r=-0.20, P=0.002). The overexpression of p-AKT and p-NF-kappaB were significantly related to shorter survival (P=0.002 and P=0.003). The up-regulation of p-NF-kappaB expression was also related to enhanced risk of recurrence and metastasis (P=0.006). Cox multivariate analysis showed that the expression of p-AKT and p-NF-kappaB were correlated to shorter overall survival (OS) (P=0.017 and P=0.008) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.005 and P=0.012), while the expression of p-STAT3 had no correlation to OS (P=0.332) and DFS (P=0.237).</str>

      <str>The incomplete P elements TP5 and TP6 are inserted in the TAS repeats near the left telomere of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome. These telomeric P elements repress P-induced gonadal dysgenesis and germ-line hypermutability in both sexes. However, their capacity to repress hypermutability is lost when they are transmitted patroclinously in a cross. TP5 and TP6 do not repress P-element activity in somatic cells, nor do they alter the somatic or germ-line phenotypes of P-insertion alleles. In the germ line, these elements suppress the phenotype of a P-insertion allele of the singed gene that is evoked by other P elements, presumably because these other elements encode repressor polypeptides. This suppression is more effective when the telomeric P elements are inherited maternally. Regulation by telomeric P elements parallels that of the P cytotype, a state that represses P-element activity in some strains of Drosophila. This state exists only in the germ line and is maternally transmitted along with the P elements themselves. Regulation by known repressor P polypeptides is not restricted to the germ line and does not require maternal transmission of the relevant P elements. Regulation by telomeric P elements appears to be epistatic to regulation by repressor P polypeptides.</str>

      <str>Short-term trials of growth hormone (GH) substitution in hypopituitary adults have shown beneficial effects on body composition. To evaluate the long-term effects on body composition, we followed thirteen GH-deficient adults (GH &lt; 6 mU/l following standard provocative tests) for 4 years of GH replacement. At yearly intervals, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist, waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) and resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were determined, and body composition was assessed using three independent methods: total body potassium (TBK), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Compared to baseline, IGF-I levels increased significantly at 1 (p = 0.0001), 2 (p = 0.0004), 3 (p = 0.006) and 4 years (p = 0.002). Body weight and BMI changed minimally at 1, 2 and 3 years and increased significantly only at the fourth year (p = 0.012 and p = 0.0009, respectively) of GH therapy. Waist and WHR decreased significantly at 1, 2 and 4 years (waist: p = 0.0009, p = 0.0004, p = 0.049; WHR: p = 0.0025, p = 0.012, p = 0.047, respectively). Neither resting SBP nor DBP changed significantly. Fat-free mass (FFM) derived from TBK and BIA increased significantly at 1 (p = 0.004; p = 0.004), 2 (p = 0.003; p = 0.05), 3 (p = 0.005; p = 0.04) and 4 years (p = 0.02; p = 0.002). Using DXA, the increase in FFM was significant at 1 (p = 0.007) and 2 years (p = 0.008) but not at 3 and 4 years. Percentage body fat measured by TBK, BIA and DXA decreased significantly at 1 (p = 0.008; p = 0.003; p = 0.03), 2 (p = 0.018; p = 0.06; p = 0.049) and 4 years (p = 0.03; p = 0.002; p = 0.04). A rise in total body water, calculated from BIA, was observed at 1 year (p = 0.004) and was maintained throughout the treatment period. These data demonstrate that 4 years of GH treatment in hypopituitary adults is associated with sustained improvement in body composition.</str>

      <str>A highly purified preparation of human properdin (P) has been obtained in a simple two-step procedure utilizing reversed application of the technique of affinity chromatography. The method involved precipitation of properdin from human serum and subsequent passage through an immunoadsorbent column of Sepharose anti-RP globulin which bound the contaminating proteins. The immunochemical properties of the isolated properdin (P) was found to be different from those of activated properdin (P). P was shown to be a 6.1S, beta2 globulin with a mean subunit m.w. of 57,900. P on the other hand was a 5.1S protein with gamma2 mobility and a subunit m.w. of 53,000 daltons. Double diffusion analysis using anti-P revealed a reaction of identity between P and P. However, when the reaction was developed with anti-P, a reaction of partial identity was obtained and the precipitin line of P was seen to spur over the line developed with P. Mild treatment with plasmin or trypsin converted P to P. Unlike P, P was ineffective in triggering the activation of the Properdin System in RP unless trace amounts of zymosan were added. Under these conditions P was found to be converted to P. The results indicate that properdin is present in fresh serum in a precursor form and its activation to P involves a limited proteolytic cleavage of the molecule.</str>

      <str>A novel non-dsrAB (without dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes) sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Clostridium sp. BXM was isolated from a paddy soil. Incubation experiments were then performed to investigate the formation of reduced sulfur compounds (RSC) by Clostridium sp. BXM, and RSC-induced dechlorination of p,p'-DDT in culture medium and soil solution. The RSCs produced were 5.8 mM and 4.5 mM in 28 mM sulfate amended medium and soil solution respectively after 28-day cultivation. The p,p'-DDT dechlorination ratios were 74% and 45.8% for 5.8mM and 4.5 mM RSCs respectively at 6h. The metabolites of p,p'-DDT found in the two reaction systems were identified as p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE. The dechlorination pathways of p,p'-DDT to p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE were proposed, based on mass balance and dechlorination time-courses. The results indicated that RSC-induced natural dechlorination may play an important role in the fate of organochlorines.</str>

      <str>Nephrotoxicity of some aromatic nitro-amino compounds were evaluated by urinary enzyme activities and renal histopathological changes. Male Fischer 344 rats were intraperitoneally injected with aniline, p-aminophenol, acetyl-p-aminophenol, p-chloroaniline, p-chloronitrobenzene, p-anisidine, or p-nitroaniline at 1.0 mmol/kg. In the rats injected with p-aminophenol, necrosis of renal tubular epithelial cells and remarkable elevation of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP) activities were observed. Injection with p-chloroaniline caused significant elevation of the urinary NAG and gamma-GTP activities. p-Anisidine and p-nitroaniline induced swelling of the tubular epithelial cells and a significant elevation in urinary NAG activities in rats, which was also caused by p-chloronitrobenzene. However, administration of aniline or acetyl-p-aminophenol did not change either the urinary enzymes or renal histopathology. These results indicate that p-aminophenol is a highly nephrotoxic substance, and that nephrotoxicity of p-chloroaniline, p-chloronitrobenzene, p-anisidine and p-nitroaniline exceed that of acetyl-p-aminophenol which has been known to cause a renal damage.</str>

      <str>Cytochrome P-450, designated as P-450-MK1, which is cross-reactive with antibodies to rat P-450-male, was purified to an electrophoretical homogeneity from liver microsomes of the untreated male crab-eating monkey. The molecular weight of P-450-MK1 was estimated to be 50,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The oxidized form of P-450-MK1 showed a peak at 418 nm, indicating that this cytochrome is in a low spin state. The carbon monoxide-bound reduced form showed a peak at 451 nm. The first 22 amino acid residues of the NH2-terminal sequence of P-450-MK1 was fairly homologous to those of P-450-male (75% identity, not including unidentified amino acid residues). Unlike the P-450-male, P-450-MK1 did not exhibit catalytic activities for testosterone 2 alpha- and 16 alpha-hydroxylations and catalyzed testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation. It is, therefore, suggested that although the spectral and immunochemical properties and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of P-450-MK1 were similar to those of P-450-male, the physiological functions of P-450-MK1 may be somewhat different from those of P-450-male. Comparison of the physico-chemical properties of P-450-MK1 with those of P-450-D1 and P-450-HM2, which are cross-reactive with anti-P-450-male antibodies, purified from liver microsomes of dogs and humans, respectively, are also discussed.</str>

      <str>To determine whether different methods for the manual measurement of P wave duration are mutually consistent, we evaluated the intraobserver and interobserver errors of P wave measurements obtained in three different ways: (1) by cursor on a high resolution computer screen (on screen), (2) by calipers and a magnifying glass (on paper), and (3) by a high resolution digitizing board (on board). The agreement between the methods was assessed in 30 normal subjects and 30 patients with a history of atrial fibrillation. The maximum P wave duration (P maximum), the minimum P wave duration (P minimum), mean P wave duration (P mean), P wave dispersion (P dispersion = P maximum - P minimum), and the standard deviation of the P wave duration in all measured leads (P SD) were calculated from a 12-lead electrocardiogram in each subject. Only P maximum, P mean, and P dispersion were significantly higher in patients than in controls with all three methods. Intraobserver and interobserver relative errors were significantly different among the three methods; the lowest errors were associated with the on-screen measurement. The agreement between the three different methods was acceptable for P maximum, P mean, and P SD and rather poor for P minimum and P dispersion in both groups. The differences of the measurement by different methods did not consistently differ between the two groups. Hence, the on-screen measurements are consistent with other manual methods and provide more stable results. Manual measurement of ECG patterns should be preferably performed with digital ECG recordings displayed on a high resolution computer screen.</str>

      <str>To evaluate the prevalence of interatrial block in healthy school-aged children, we obtained 12-lead digital ECGs (Cardioperfect 1.1, CardioControl NV, Delft, The Netherlands) of 664 healthy children (349 males/315 females, age range 6-14 years old). P-wave analysis indices [mean, maximum and minimum (in the 12 leads) P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, P-wave morphology in the derived orthogonal (X, Y, Z) leads, as well the amplitude of the maximum spatial P-wave vector] were calculated in all study participants.</str>
      <str>P-wave descriptor values were: mean P-wave duration 84.9 + or - 9.5 ms, maximum P-wave duration 99.0 + or - 9.8 ms, P dispersion 32.2 + or - 12.5 ms, spatial P amplitude 182.7 + or - 69.0 microV. P-wave morphology distribution in the orthogonal leads were: Type I 478 (72.0%), Type II 178 (26.8%), Type III 1 (0.2%), indeterminate 7 (1%). Maximum P-wave duration was positively correlated to age (P &lt; 0.001) and did not differ between sexes (P = 0.339). Using the 90-ms value as cutoff for P-wave duration, 502 (75.6%) children would be classified as having maximum P-wave duration above reference range. The 95th and the 99th percentiles were in the overall population 117 ms and 125 ms, respectively. P-wave morphology type was not in any way correlated to P-wave duration (P = 0.715).</str>

      <str>P-Glycoprotein (Pgp) is associated with poor outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have investigated other ATP-binding cassette proteins such as BCRP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP5 for their potential implication in chemoresistance.</str>
      <str>Eighty five AML patient samples were analyzed in this study. First, MRP3 function was higher in patients which had a high level of leukocytes (P = 0.01), a M5 FAB subtype (P = 0.04), and an intermediate or poor cytogenesis (P = 0.05). BCRP activity was not correlated with clinical or biological variables, but high Pgp activity was correlated with the following variables: CD34 expression (P = 0.002), FAB subtype (P = 0.002), intermediate or poor cytogenesis (P = 0.02), and elderly patients (P = 0.03). Second, Pgp, MRP3, and BCRP activities were correlated with complete remission (P = 0.02, P = 0.04, and P = 0.04, respectively), disease-free survival (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, and P = 0.25, respectively), and overall survival (P = 0.04, P = 0.04, and P = 0.05, respectively) in multivariate analysis. The patient samples expressing one or none of these Pgp, MRP3, or BCRP functional proteins have a better prognosis than the patients expressing two or three of these functional proteins (complete remission, P = 0.02; disease-free survival, P = 0.01; overall survival, P &lt; 0.001).</str>

      <str>Increasing emphasis on phosphorus (P)-based nutrient management underscores the need to understand P behavior in soils amended with biosolids and manures. Laboratory and greenhouse column studies characterized P forms and leachability of eight biosolids products, chicken manure (CM), and commercial fertilizer (triple superphosphate, TSP). Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) was grown for 4 mo on two acid, P-deficient Florida sands, representing both moderate (Candler series: hyperthermic, uncoated Typic Quartzipsamments) and very low (Immokalee series: sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Alaquods) P-sorbing capacities. Amendments were applied at 56 and 224 kg P(T) ha(-1), simulating P-based and N-based nutrient loadings, respectively. Column leachate P was dominantly inorganic and lower for biosolids P sources than TSP. For Candler soil, only TSP at the high P rate exhibited P leaching statistically greater (alpha = 0.05) than control (soil-only) columns. For the high P rate and low P-sorbing Immokalee soil, TSP and CM leached 21 and 3.0% of applied P, respectively. Leachate P for six biosolids was &lt;1.0% of applied P and not statistically different from controls. Largo biosolids, generated from a biological P removal process, exhibited significantly greater leachate P in both cake and pelletized forms (11 and 2.5% of applied P, respectively) than other biosolids. Biosolids P leaching was correlated to the phosphorus saturation index (PSI = [Pox]/[Al(ox) + Fe(ox)]) based on oxalate extraction of the pre-applied biosolids. For hiosolids with PSI &lt; or = approximately 1.1, no appreciable leaching occurred. Only Largo cake (PSI = 1.4) and pellets (PSI = 1.3) exhibited P leaching losses statistically greater than controls. The biosolids PSI appears useful for identifying biosolids with potential to enrich drainage P when applied to low P-sorbing soils.</str>

      <str>We investigated whether the early postoperative time course of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level after resection of lung cancer could be used to predict patients' prognosis. Fifty-three lung cancer patients were included in this study. Postoperative serum CEA levels were calculated by means of non-linear least-squares fitting to the equation C(t) = (C(0)-C(p))exp(-kt) + C(p), where C(t) is postoperative CEA level, t is days after surgery, C(0) is CEA level at postoperative time 0, C(p) is CEA level at plateau, and k is the rate constant of elimination. Postoperative CEA production (P(p)) was calculated as C(p) multiplied by k. C(p) and P(p) represent the numbers of residual tumor cells after surgery. More residual tumor cells yield higher values of C(p) and P(p), and result in earlier recurrence.</str>
      <str>Kinetic parameters could be obtained for 30 patients whose preoperative CEA levels were sufficiently elevated. Cutoff levels as predictors for recurrence were 1.1 ng/ml for C(p) and 0.9 ng/ml/day for P(p). The accuracy of prediction of recurrence using these cutoff levels was 79% with C(p) and 89% with P(p). A very poor prognosis was observed for patients with P(p) over 0.9 ng/ml/day.</str>
      <str>Analysis of the time course of changes in CEA levels after resection of lung cancer appears to be useful for predicting patient prognosis. C(p) and P(p) are very precise predictors of recurrence.</str>

      <str>One of each constitutive form of cytochrome P-450 from liver microsomes of adult male and female rats was purified essentially following the same method to an apparent homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights estimated by the electrophoresis were 52,000 and 50,000 for forms of cytochrome P-450, P-450-male, and P-450-female, purified from male and female rats, respectively. In addition, the purified preparations of P-450-male and P-450-female showed properties different from each other with respect to spectral characteristics and catalytic activities. In Ouchterlony double diffusion plates, partially purified rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) raised against P-450-male and P-450-female showed very weak or no cross-reactivity with P-450-female and P-450-male, respectively. From these results, P-450-male was confirmed to be a form distinct from P-450-female. The anti-P-450-male and anti-P-450-female antibodies, which had been further purified by immunoadsorption, did not form any apparent precipitation bands with liver microsomes from untreated female and male rats, respectively. Supporting this, radial immunodiffusion analysis for P-450-male and P-450-female with an agarose gel impregnated with the rabbit antibodies showed that P-450-male and P-450-female appear in liver microsomes rather specifically depending on the sex hormones. Based on these results, sex differences in drug metabolism in the rat were confirmed as explicable, at least in part, by the presence of distinct forms of cytochrome P-450 in microsomes of male and female rats.</str>

      <str>Pelophylax nigromaculatus, P. porosus porosus, and P. p. brevipoda are three pond frog species distributed in Japan. Their distributions overlap at two basins in central Japan (P. nigromaculatus and P. p. porosus in the Matsumoto basin, and P. nigromaculatus and P. p. brevipoda in the Ina basin), and hybrid descendants have been found in these areas. To clarify the distribution areas and hybrid zones of the frogs, and to understand the mode of introgressive hybridization and its impact on the frog populations, we conducted exhaustive sampling at each basin and performed allozyme and mtDNA analyses of 233 individuals. Analysis using genetic markers clearly detected nine F1 hybrids and 94 hybrid descendants of P. nigromaculatus and P. porosus from the overlapping areas of both basins. Allozyme and mtDNA data suggest directional hybridization between female P. p. porosus and male P. nigromaculatus in the Matsumoto basin. Over the past 30 years, the distribution of P. p. porosus has been narrowed and fragmented by the invasion of P. nigromaculatus, seemingly because of directional hybridization in the Matsumoto basin. In the Ina basin, the "pure" P. p. brevipoda (n = 8) population was extremely reduced by gene introgression from P. nigromaculatus, yet its distribution was barely changed compared to the Matsumoto basin. Consequently, this study shows that P. porosus populations are threatened by interspecific hybridization with P. nigromaculatus, and that introgressive hybridization damaged P. porosus populations by different means in each basin.</str>

      <str>In spite of widespread belief among clinicians that caffeinated drinks are linked with palpitations, tachycardia and dysrhythmia there is paucity of documentary evidence. We investigated the arrhythmogenic activity of caffeine in canine model. The alkaloid was given i.v. to perform 51 experiments in 13 anesthetized dogs in three different doses. The Low dose generated significant Sinus (S) bradycardia (70%; p &lt; 0.006, S. arrhythmia (70%; p &lt; 0.02), S. arrest (50%; p &lt; 0.04), Atrial (A) ectopics (40%; p &lt; 0.016), Wandering of pacemaker (WPM) (50%; p &lt; 0.04), and Ventricular premature contractions (VPC--unifocal 40%; p &lt; 0.05) as compared with control ECGs. Medium dose induced significant S. arrhythmia (62%; p &lt; 0.001), A. ectopics (25%; p &lt; 0.01), A. tachycardia (25%; p &lt; 0.01), WPM (25%; p &lt; 0.01), VPCs--unifocal (50%; p &lt; 0.002), multifocal (25%; p &lt; 0.01), couplets (25%; p &lt; 0.01) and interpolated (25%; p &lt; 0.01). High dose of caffeine revealed significant S. arrhythmia (56%; p &lt; 0.002), A. ectopics (44%; p &lt; 0.005), A. tachycardia (32%; p &lt; 0.01), WPM (32%; p &lt; 0.01) and VPCs--unifocal (64%; p &lt; 0.001), multifocal (32%, p &lt; 0.01), couplets (32%, p &lt; 0.01), interpolated (32%; p &lt; 0.01) and Ventricular tachycardia (VT) (20%; p &lt; 0.01). A. flutter and fibrillation each were observed in two experiments only. In conclusion, these data indicate a dose dependent arrhythmogenecity of caffeine. Small dose, mostly, generated, benign arrhythmias due to vagal stimulation. More severe arrhythmias like VT, multifocal VPC. A. flutter and A. fibrillation were generated with higher dose of caffeine. Mechanism remains uncertain as caffeine has multiple actions. Further studies in human beings with normal and compromised myocardium may elucidate arrhythmogenic effects of caffeine.</str>

      <str>Obesity is associated with altered atrial electrophysiology and a prominent risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Body mass index, the most widely used adiposity measure, has been related to atrial electrical remodeling. We tested the hypothesis that pericardial fat is independently associated with electrocardiographic measures of atrial conduction.</str>
      <str>We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 1946 Framingham Heart Study participants (45% women) to determine the relation between pericardial fat and atrial conduction as measured by P wave indices (PWI): PR interval, P wave duration (P-duration), P wave amplitude (P-amplitude), P wave area (P-area), and P wave terminal force (P-terminal). We performed sex-stratified linear regression analyses adjusted for relevant clinical variables and ectopic fat depots. Each 1-SD increase in pericardial fat was significantly associated with PR interval (β=1.7 ms, P=0.049), P-duration (β=2.3 ms, P&lt;0.001), and P-terminal (β=297 μV·ms, P&lt;0.001) among women; and P-duration (β=1.2 ms, P=0.002), P-amplitude (β=-2.5 μV, P&lt;0. 001), and P-terminal (β=160 μV·ms, P=0.002) among men. Among both sexes, pericardial fat was significantly associated with P-duration in analyses additionally adjusting for visceral fat or intrathoracic fat; a similar but non-significant trend existed with P-terminal. Among women, pericardial fat was significantly associated with P wave area after adjustment for visceral and intrathoracic fat.</str>
      <str>Pericardial fat is associated with atrial conduction as quantified by PWI, even with adjustment for extracardiac fat depots. Further studies are warranted to identify the mechanisms through which pericardial fat may modify atrial electrophysiology and promote subsequent risk for arrhythmogenesis.</str>

      <str>The process of phosphorus (P) transformation in particulate matter during sediment resuspension and sedimentation was studied. The P-binding forms in resuspended particles (RP) and settled particles (SP) were analyzed by sequential fractionation (modified Psenner method) and an extended extraction with ammonium oxalate. Water quality data and P fractions were used to estimate P release and uptake by the resuspended and settling sediment particles. Results of 8-h resuspension experiments showed increases of dissolved oxygen, pH, total phosphorus, and particulate phosphorus in overlying water, but no change in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). P fractions extracted with common sequential fractionation showed that the increase of total P in RP was mainly due to increases of redox-sensitive bound P BD (BD-SRP) and P bound to Al and Fe oxides (NaOH-SRP) (36-52 % and 30-36 % of total increased P, respectively). Comparisons between two sequential fractionations indicated that inorganic P extracted with ammonium oxalate consisted of P bound to amorphous Fe/Al oxy-hydroxides and partially of carbonate-bound P (HCl-SRP) and that increased P in RP was mainly caused by increases in P bound to amorphous oxides. It is concluded that the formation of amorphous oxides and subsequent adsorption of P lead to the increase of P in RP. However, P adsorbed by amorphous oxy-hydroxides in RP is unstable and may be released under sedimentation conditions. Meanwhile, increases in HCl-SRP, refractory P, and crystalline Fe-P were found in SP compared with RP. NaOH-SRP in SP increased gradually under sedimentation conditions. It is suggested that, during sedimentation, mobile P can be transformed to non-mobile P forms that provide long-term P retention. The findings contribute to the understanding of P cycling in particulate matter during sediment resuspension and sedimentation.</str>

      <str>The experiment was conducted to examine opportunities for enhancing pork quality through the use of post-mortem ageing when combined with different chilling regimes. Large White (LW, n=24) and Duroc×Large White (Duroc, n=24) barrows were slaughtered and alternate carcass sides were either conventionally or blast-chilled. The longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle was dissected from the carcass sides (24h post-mortem) and trimmed of cover fat. Three sections (15cm length) were vacuum packaged and assigned to 2, 7 or 14days of ageing (2°C) randomized within muscle location. Blast-chilled meat had lower purge (P=0.009) and drip (P=0.0009) losses and higher hue (P=0.02) than conventionally chilled meat. However chilling by conventional or blast-chilling methods had no effect on sensory characteristics (P&gt;0.1). When breeds were compared, meat from Duroc barrows had lower moisture (P&lt;0.0001) and higher intramuscular fat content (P&lt;0.0001), L∗ (P=0.0003) and hue (P=0.007) values than LW. Overall tenderness (P=0.005), juiciness (P=0.0007) and palatability (P&lt;0.0001), as well as flavour intensity (P&lt;0.0001) and desirability (P&lt;0.0001) values were higher and undesirable flavours were lower (P&lt;0.0001) for meat from Duroc pigs, when compared with LW. Ageing increased purge loss (P&lt;0.0001), L∗ (P&lt;0.0001), hue (P&lt;0.0001), chroma (P&lt;0.0001) and content of protein (P=0.002), with corresponding decreases (P&lt;0.0001) in drip loss and moisture content. Instrumental (P&lt;0.0001) and sensory (initial, P&lt;0.0001 and overall, P&lt;0.0001) tenderness increased from day 2 to 14. Therefore independent of chilling method, ageing improved quality of pork loins. Moreover ageing had greater effect on tenderness, while breed had greater effect on flavour which may be related to differences in intramuscular fat content.</str>

      <str>An experiment was conducted to evaluate a novel procedure for estimating endogenous losses of P and for measuring the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and true total tract digestibility (TTTD) of P in 5 inorganic P sources fed to growing pigs. The P sources were dicalcium phosphate (DCP), monocalcium phosphate (MCP) with 50% purity (MCP50), MCP with 70% purity (MCP70), MCP with 100% purity (MCP100), and monosodium phosphate (MSP). A gelatin-based, P-free basal diet was formulated and used to estimate endogenous losses of P. Five P-containing diets were formulated by adding 0.20% total P from each of the inorganic P sources to the basal diet. A seventh diet was formulated by adding 0.16% P from MCP70 to the basal diet. All diets were fed to 7 growing pigs in a 7 x 7 Latin square design, and urine and feces were collected during 5 d of each period. The endogenous loss of P was estimated as 139 +/- 18 mg/kg of DMI. The ATTD of P in MSP was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in DCP, MCP50, and MCP70 (91.9 vs. 81.5, 82.6, and 81.7%, respectively). In MSP, the TTTD of P was 98.2%. This value was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than the TTTD of P in DCP, MCP50, and MCP70 (88.4, 89.5, and 88.6%, respectively). The ATTD and the TTTD for MCP70 were similar in diets formulated to contain 0.16 and 0.20% total P. Results from the current experiment demonstrate that a P-free diet may be used to measure endogenous losses of P in pigs. By adding inorganic P sources to this diet, the ATTD of P can be directly measured and the TTTD of P may be calculated for each source of P.</str>

      <str>The metabolism of a single oral zinc-65 dose was studied in young dairy calves fed two concentrations of added A1 (0 and .20% A1) and two concentrations of added P (0 and .22% P) for 7 wk. The four treatments were 1) normal P-low A1, 2) low P-low A1, 3) normal P-high A1 and 4) low P-high A1. The basal diet (low P-low AL) contained, by analysis, .132% P, .74% Ca, .021% A1 and 59 ppm Zn. Zinc-65 absorption was greater (66.5 vs 63.2% of dose, P less than .10) with the low-P diet; added A1 reduced (P less than .05) 65Zn absorption. Calves fed low-P diets had higher (P less than .10) concentrations of 65Zn in liver, kidney, spleen, heart, small intestine and testicle than those fed normal-P diets. Zinc-65 was reduced (P less than .10) in pancreas, heart, testicle and muscle of calves fed high A1. Iron was increased in liver and kidney (P less than .10), Zn (P less than .10) and Mn (P less than .01) were increased in liver, but Fe in small intestine and Cu in muscle and tibia shaft were decreased (P less than .10) in calves fed the low-P diets compared to those fed adequate-P diets. High A1 reduced (P less than .10) Cu in small intestine and tibia shaft. The results suggest that zinc metabolism may be moderately affected in calves fed either low-P or high-A1 diets.</str>

      <str>Apoptotic cells were quantitated by light microscopy in a series of 288 breast carcinomas, and their number (cells/mm2 of neoplastic epithelium, i.e., the apoptotic index, AI) was related to various histopathological features and disease outcome. High AI was associated with tumour necrosis (P = 0.003), lack of tubule formation (P = 0.03), dense stromal lymphocyte infiltration (P = 0.0009), high grade of the tumour (P &lt; 0.0001), DNA aneuploidy (P = 0.049), high S-phase fraction (P = 0.010), high mitotic rate (P &lt; 0.0001), lack of sex steroid receptors (P = 0.004), expression of p53 tumour suppressor gene (P = 0.004), and high values of morphometrically measured nuclear factors (P &lt; 0.05). In survival analysis, an AI greater than 3/mm2 was related to short recurrence-free survival in the entire cohort (P = 0.0079) as well as in the axillary lymph node-negative tumours (P = 0.0253). Survival of the patients with node-negative tumours (P = 0.0356), node-positive tumours (P = 0.0085) and in the entire cohort (P = 0.004) was related to AI. Recurrence-free survival was related to the mitotic index (P = 0.0012), ductal type (P = 0.011), S.D. of the nuclear area (P = 0.075), and axillary lymph node status (P = 0.096). Cox's analysis showed that only the tumour diameter (P &lt; 0.001), axillary lymph node status (P = 0.001), progesterone receptor content (P = 0.004) and ductal type (P = 0.041) had independent prognostic value, whereas AI did not.</str>

      <str>Two amphetamine metabolites, p-hydroxyamphetamine (p-OHA) and p-hydroxynorephedrine (p-OHN), selectively inhibited the A form of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in rat and mouse forebrain homogenates. Of these two metabolites, p-OHA inhibited MAO-A more strongly than p-OHN. This MAO-A-selective inhibition by p-OHA or p-OHN was found to be competitive with respect to deamination of its substrate, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The degree of MAO-A inhibition was not changed by 90 min of preincubation of the enzyme preparations with either metabolite, and the activity inhibited by p-OHA after the preincubation recovered completely to the control level after repeated washing. Uptake of 5-HT or dopamine into mouse forebrain synaptosomes was highly reduced by both p-OHA and p-OHN. Both metabolites were more potent in reducing dopamine uptake than in reducing 5-HT uptake. In reduction of 5-HT and of dopamine uptake, p-OHA was more potent than p-OHN. These results indicate that p-OHA is a more selective inhibitor of brain MAO-A activity and 5-HT uptake than its subsequent metabolite, p-OHN. These two actions of p-OHA might, together with possible 5-HT efflux into the synaptic cleft, greatly contribute to head twitch, a brain 5-HT-mediated animal behavior induced by p-OHA.</str>

      <str>Understanding P sorption from animal manures is essential to formulate best management practices with regard to land application of manure from the standpoint of crop production and environmental quality. Little research has focused on the construction of P sorption isotherms where the P source is manure. The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop a procedure to characterize how inorganic P (P(i)) and total P (P(t)) from dairy slurry and swine slurry sorbs to soil; and (ii) compare the sorption characteristics of P(i) and P(t) where the P source was dairy slurry, swine slurry, or potassium phosphate (KH2PO4). Sorption solutions were prepared in 0.1 M KCl at pH 6 and equilibrated with soils at a 1:25 (w/v) soil/solution ratio for 24 h. Inorganic P, P(t), Al, and Fe in the equilibrated solutions were measured. For all soils, P(i) and P(t) sorption capacity of dairy slurry was greater than KH2PO4. Total P sorption capacity of swine slurry was greater than KH2PO4, while P(i) sorption capacity was less than KH2PO4. Overall, P(i) and P(t) sorption strengths of the manure slurries were less than or equal to KH2PO4. Increased P(i) sorption from dairy slurry was correlated with Fe and Al desorption. Reduction of P(i) sorption capacity from swine slurry was related to preferential sorption of organic P. Additional studies need to be conducted to determine how differences in P sorption between manures and fertilizer impact in-field P availability to a crop and potential for losses in runoff water.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether midazolam exhibits characteristics of a highly permeable P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and to evaluate the potential influence of P-gp inhibition on 1-OH midazolam formation during midazolam transport.</str>
      <str>P-gp interaction was investigated by P-gp ATPase assay, efflux inhibition studies, and transport studies of midazolam across MDR1-MDCK and 1-alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-induced Caco-2 monolayers with and without the P-gp inhibitor GF120918.</str>
      <str>Midazolam was highly permeable and transport appeared essentially unpolarized. In MDR1-MDCK, the basolateral-to-apical (B-to-A) permeability was slightly higher (16%) than apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) permeability (p = 0.04); GF120918 increased A-to-B permeability by 27% (p = 0.01), and increased cellular midazolam accumulation during A-to-B transport by 45% (p = 0.01). Midazolam (200 microM) decreased rhodamine123 and vinblastine B/A ratios 3-fold (p &lt; 0.006), while increasing their cellular accumulation (p &lt; 0.003). P-gp ATPase activation by midazolam was dose-dependent and saturable [Km = 11.5(+/- 4.0) microM; Vmax = 41.1(+/- 7.4) nmol/mg/min]. P-gp inhibition increased 1-OH midazolam formation in A-to-B studies 1.3-fold when midazolam donor &gt; or = 10 microM (p &lt; 0.03). In B-to-A studies, P-gp inhibition did not significantly increase metabolite formation (p = 0.06). Midazolam's extraction ratio was not influenced by P-gp (p = 0.2).</str>
      <str>The results indicate that midazolam exhibited characteristics of a highly permeable P-gp substrate. 1-OH midazolam formation during A-to-B midazolam transport increased slightly when P-gp was inhibited.</str>

      <str>The expression (Estimated-Predicted)/Predicted creatinine generation ¿(E-P)/P¿ has been proposed as an index of compliance in continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD). We attempted to define an (E-P)/P value that can be used as a cut-off for non-compliance and to characterize the relation of (E-P)/P to serum albumin. In 324 clearance studies, (E-P)/P had a normal distribution with a mean of +0.094 and an SD of 0.357. In these studies, there was a weak correlation between (E-P)/P and serum albumin (r = 0.12, P &lt; 0.05), but (E-P)/P was not a predictor of serum albumin by logistic regression. In 34 CPD patients, who had an increase in the dose of CPD resulting in an increase in measured creatinine clearance from 43.8 +/- 14.0 to 66.1 +/- 17.6 L/1.73 m2 weekly (P &lt; 0.001), (E-P)/P increased correspondingly from +0.018 +/- 0.284 to +0.153 +/- 0.369 (P = 0.018), although all subjects should be in a steady state of creatinine excretion in the second study. The rise in (E-P)/P was statistically significant in the subgroup of 17 subjects who had a decrease in serum albumin, but not in the subgroup of 14 subjects who had an increase in serum albumin from the first to the second clearance study. The (E-P)/P cut-off for a definitive diagnosis of CPD non-compliance may be around +0.400 or +0.500. The findings of this study suggest that non-compliance, as indicated by (E-P)/P, has an adverse effect on serum albumin and that non-compliance increases after a prescribed increase in the dose of CPD.</str>

      <str>Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly prevalent in China. Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) are considered the major risk factors, among the high-risk cohorts only a small fraction develops liver cancer. Therefore, we investigated if organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) exposure contributed to HCC risk in the Xiamen population. The questionnaire database was built from 346 HCC cases and 961 healthy controls during 2007-2009. The serum levels of α-, β-, γ-, δ-HCH, p, p'-DDT, p, p'-DDE, o, p'-DDT and p, p'-DDD were measured by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer and statistical analysis was done using SPSS16. Significantly, we observed p, p'-DDT, p, p'-DDE, and at first time β-HCH displayed quartile dose-dependent HCC risk trends; p, p'-DDT showed positive (i.e., synergistic) interactions with HBV, diabetes mellitus, AFB1 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure, but negative (i.e., antagonistic) interaction with heavy drinking; p, p'-DDE had positive interaction with PAH but negative interaction with HBV and p, p'-DDT; and β-HCH was positively interacted with p, p'-DDT but negatively interacted with heavy drinking and diabetes. p, p'-DDT, p, p'-DDE and β-HCH were independent HCC risk factors. Because of their synergistic interactions with other factors, the high level exposure combined with common AFB1 and HBV exposure in the investigated area may greatly enhance the risk of HCC.</str>

      <str>1,1-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (DDT) is an organochlorine pesticide. Its metabolite, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethene (p,p'-DDE) is a persistent environmental contaminant and both compounds accumulate in animals. Because multidrug resistance transporters, such as p-glycoprotein, function as a defense against xenobiotic exposure, we analyzed the ability of DDT and p,p'-DDE to act as efflux modulators. Using a competitive intact cell assay based on the efflux of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123, we found that DDT, but not p,p'-DDE, stimulated dye retention. Subsequent studies using verapamil as competitor suggested that DDT is a weak p-glycoprotein inhibitor. Further studies addressed the ability of DDT and p,p'-DDE to induce MDR1, the gene encoding p-glycoprotein. In HepG2 cells, we found that both compounds induced MDR1 by twofold to threefold. Similar results were observed in mouse liver after a single dose of p,p'-DDE, although some gender-specific induction differences were noted. By contrast, p,p'-DDE failed to induce MDR1 in HeLa cells, indicating some cell-specific effects for induction. Further expression studies demonstrated increased levels of the endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperone, Bip, in response to DDT, but not p,p'-DDE. These results suggest that DDT, but not p,p'-DDE, induces an endoplasmic reticulum stress response.</str>

Of these, only two P. saevus (one from Upper Awash and one from Middle Awash) and three P. sergenti (from Upper Awash) positives were successfully isolated in culture and were typed by isoenzyme analysis. Four isolates (two each from P. saevus and P. sergenti) were identified as new zymodemes (Z) of L. tropica and one isolate from P. sergenti was typed as a new zymodeme of L. aethiopica. This is the first finding of natural infections of P. saevus and P. arabicus and the first evidence for the former to be a vector of L. tropica. This is also the first time P. sergenti has been implicated in L. tropica transmission in Ethiopia; the isolation of L. aethiopica from a Paraphlebotomus species (P. sergenti) is also a new record. The possible presence of human cutaneous leishmaniasis (L. tropica and L. aethiopica), and wild reservoir host(s) of the parasites, especially rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) in the Upper and Middle Awash Valley remain to be determined.</str>

      <str>The VacA toxin secreted by Helicobacter pylori is considered to be an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. VacA monomers self-assemble into water-soluble oligomeric structures and can form anion-selective membrane channels. The goal of this study was to characterize VacA-VacA interactions that may mediate assembly of VacA monomers into higher order structures. We investigated potential interactions between two domains of VacA (termed p-33 and p-55) by using a yeast two-hybrid system. p-33/p-55 interactions were detected in this system, whereas p-33/p-33 and p-55/p-55 interactions were not detected. Several p-33 proteins containing internal deletion mutations were unable to interact with wild-type p-55 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Introduction of these same deletion mutations into the H. pylori vacA gene resulted in secretion of mutant VacA proteins that failed to assemble into large oligomeric structures and that lacked vacuolating toxic activity for HeLa cells. Additional mapping studies in the yeast two-hybrid system indicated that only the N-terminal portion of the p-55 domain is required for p-33/p-55 interactions. To characterize further p-33/p-55 interactions, we engineered an H. pylori strain that produced a VacA toxin containing an enterokinase cleavage site located between the p-33 and p-55 domains. Enterokinase treatment resulted in complete proteolysis of VacA into p-33 and p-55 domains, which remained physically associated within oligomeric structures and retained vacuolating cytotoxin activity. These results provide evidence that interactions between p-33 and p-55 domains play an important role in VacA assembly into oligomeric structures.</str>

      <str>Placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP) is a cell surface aminopeptidase (oxytocinase). We cloned P-LAP cDNA and found a widespread tissue distribution of P-LAP. Since P-LAP can degrade several small peptide hormones such as oxytocin, this enzyme may affect many cellular functions of carcinoma cells as well as normal cells. This study investigated whether the expression of P-LAP correlates with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis in patients with endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.</str>
      <str>Histologic sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 99 primary endometrial carcinomas were stained for P-LAP using polyclonal P-LAP antibody.

In patients who had strongly positive P-LAP staining, the disease-free interval was significantly lower than in patients who had negative or weakly positive P-LAP staining (p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that strongly immunoreactive P-LAP (odds ratio, 12.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.84-58.8; p &lt; 0.01) and surgical stage (odds ratio, 8.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.77-27.8; p &lt; 0.01) are independent prognostic factors.</str>

      <str>Mining soil phosphorus (i.e., harvesting P taken up from the soil by a crop grown without external P addition) has been proposed as a possible management strategy for P-enriched soils to decrease the risk of P leaching. We performed a pot experiment in a greenhouse where grass was cropped on a P-enriched noncalcareous sandy soil at zero P application over a period of 978 d. We determined the long-term availability of soil P and evaluated the effectiveness of mining soil P to decrease P in different pools. There were two treatments: soil layers in the pots of either 5 or 10 cm thickness. Soils were analyzed at various stages of the experiment. Phosphorus in soil solution and the total pool of sorbed P were estimated using 1:10 (w/v) 0.01 M CaCl2 extracts and acid ammonium oxalate (P(ox)), respectively. A desorption isotherm was constructed, which described the relationship between P in soil solution and the total pool of sorbed P for the soils of the 5- and 10-cm treatments. The Langmuir equation gave a very good description of the isotherm. In the long-term, 65% of P(ox) in the initial soil can be removed by plant uptake, as was calculated from the Langmuir equation and a critical P concentration in soil solution at which P uptake can just be maintained. Thus, P(ox) may be largely plant available. From the strong nonlinearity of the desorption isotherm, it can be understood why the relative decrease of the P concentration in the CaCl2 extracts was much larger than the relative decrease of P(ox). Mining soil P decreased the P concentration in soil solution effectively and, therefore, risk of P leaching from our P-enriched soil.</str>

In the univariate analysis, the following were significant predictors of shorter overall survival: N-stage (N1 vs N0) (p&lt;0.001); T-stage (T2 vs T1) (p&lt;0.001); antigen A (loss vs presence) (p&lt;0.01); cough (present vs absent) (p=0.01); bcl-2 expression (positive vs negative) (p=0.03); age (&gt;63.5 vs &lt;63.5) (p=0.03); mucin (positive vs negative) (p&lt;0.03). The following were significant predictors of shorter DFS: N-stage (p&lt;0.001); T-stage (p=0.001); loss of antigen A (p=0.01); mucin expression (p&lt;0.01); cough (p=0.02); Ki-67 expression (p=0.02) and negative bcl-2 expression (p=0.03). Analysis of survival difference for histologic subtype, degree of differentiation, aneuploidy, %S-phase, codon 12 K-ras mutation, and immunohistochemistry staining for Lewisy, p53, Rb, microvessel count, HER2, E-cadherin and neuroendocrine markers did not reach statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, the following predicted for shorter overall survival: N-stage (p&lt;0.01), antigen A (p=0.01), age (p&lt;0.01), and bcl-2 (p=0.05); and for DFS, N-stage (p&lt;0.01), antigen A (p&lt;0.01), Ki-67 (p=0.03), mucin (p=0.04) and T-stage (p=0.05). Of all the clinical-pathological, proliferative, and biological markers studied, only a few carried independent prognostic significance.</str>

      <str>Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly prevalent in China. Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) are considered the major risk factors, among the high-risk cohorts only a small fraction develops liver cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether organochlorine pesticide exposure contributed to HCC risk in the Xiamen population. The questionnaire database was built from 346 HCC cases and 961 healthy controls during 2007-2009. The serum levels of α-, β-, γ-, δ-HCH, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p'-DDT), (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (o-chlorophenyl) ethane and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane were measured by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer, and statistical analysis was done using SPSS16. Significantly, we observed p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, and at the first time β-HCH displayed quartile dose-dependent HCC risk trends; p,p'-DDT showed positive (i.e., synergistic) interactions with HBV, diabetes mellitus, AFB1 and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure, but negative (i.e., antagonistic) interaction with heavy drinking; p,p'-DDE had positive interaction with PAH but negative interaction with HBV and p,p'-DDT; and β-HCH positively interacted with p,p'-DDT but negatively interacted with heavy drinking and diabetes. p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE and β-HCH were independent HCC risk factors. Because of their synergistic interactions with other factors, the high-level exposure combined with common AFB1 and HBV exposure in the investigated area may greatly enhance the risk of HCC.</str>

      <str>Dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis. This study explored protein expression profiles of mTOR pathway and the relationship with prognosis in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).</str>
      <str>The protein expression profiles of mTOR/phosphorylated (p-)mTOR, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/p-PDK1, p-Akt1, and P70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70S6K)/p-P70S6K were determined via immunohistochemical staining assay. The clinical prognostic values of both single and combined protein expression were investigated with univariate and multivariate survival analysis.</str>
      <str>Compared with normal lung tissues, the protein levels of mTOR/p-mTOR, p-Akt1 Ser473/Thr308, and P70S6K/p-P70S6K were higher (all P &lt; .05), whereas p-PDK1 was lower (P &lt; .05) in tumor tissues. p-mTOR expression was associated with histological differentiation, histological type, lymph node invasion, and stage (all P &lt; .05). Overall survival in NSCLC patients was significantly shorter in cases with positive phenotype for p-mTOR, p-PDK1, and p-P70S6K (all P &lt; .05). Subjects with coexpression of any 2 of p-mTOR, p-PDK1, p-Akt1 Ser473, and p-P70S6K demonstrated worse prognosis than those expressing no biomarker or any 1 biomarker alone (all P &lt; .05). Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of p-mTOR/p-P70S6K is an independent prognostic factor in addition to tumor stage.</str>
      <str>This study provides clinical evidence that activated components of mTOR pathway, not total protein, are predictors of poor prognosis in NSCLC. Moreover, evaluating protein-expression profiles of these molecules might be a new strategy for individual therapy in subjects with NSCLC.</str>

      <str>Abstract The mouse pink-eyed dilution (p) locus is known to control the melanin content in melanocytes. However, it was not known whether the p gene is involved in regulating the proliferation and differentation of melanocytes during development, especially the biogenesis of melanosomes and other organelles. Epidermal cell suspensions of neonatal dorsal skin derived from mice wild type for the p locus (black, C57BL/10JHir-P/P) and their congenic mutant phenotype (pink-eyed dilution, C57BL/10JHir-p/p) were cultured in serum-free melanocyte-proliferation medium (MDMD). The supplement of additional L-tyrosine (Tyr) into the MDMD stimulated the differentiation of p/p melanoblasts into melanocytes. Electron microscopy revealed that in p/p melanoblasts and melanocytes treated with L-Tyr, the number of stage II and III melanosomes dramatically increased. Moreover, p/p melanoblasts possessed smaller but more numerous mitochondria than P/P melanocytes. The treatment of p/p melanoblasts and melanocytes with L-Tyr decreased the number of mitochondria. The supplement of 2, 4-dinitrophenol (DNP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial function, into the MDMD stimulated both the proliferation and differentiation of p/p melanoblasts. Simultaneous treatment of DNP and L-Tyr dramatically stimulated the differetiation of p/p melanocytes. These results suggest that L-Tyr and some unknown factors related to mitochondrial function may influence the differentiation of melanoblasts in the epidermis of p/p mice.</str>

      <str>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) is the preferred reperfusion option in ST-elevation myocardial infarction, but its benefits become attenuated as time to its potential delivery becomes prolonged. Based on the STrategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction trial, we assessed the impact of increasing time delay on outcomes in patients randomised to a pharmacoinvasive strategy (PI) or P-PCI.</str>
      <str>Thirty-day clinical outcomes were examined according to PCI-related delay (P-RD). Data from hospitals that enrolled &gt;10 randomised patients were used and P-RD categorised as ≤55 min, &gt;55-97 min and &gt;97 min.</str>
      <str>Composite of death/congestive heart failure/cardiogenic shock/myocardial infarction in PI and P-PCI arms occurred in 10.6% versus 10.3% (≤55 min, p=0.910); 13.9% versus 17.9% (&gt;55-97 min, p=0.148) and 13.5% versus 16.2% (&gt;97 min, p=0.470), respectively. While there was no worsening of outcomes for PI across the P-RD spectrum, this occurred in the P-PCI arm (p(trend)=0.038). For P-RD ≤55 min, fewer events tended to occur with P-PCI than PI. Conversely, as P-RD increased to &gt;55 min, PI-assigned patients had better outcomes than P-PCI, suggesting an event-free advantage with PI as P-RD increased (p(interaction)=0.094). Analysing P-RD continuously showed that for every 10-min increment there was an increasing trend towards benefit among PI-assigned patients (p(interaction)=0.073).</str>
      <str>As P-RD increased, PI outcomes became superior to P-PCI when P-RD is prolonged and exceeds guideline-mandated times. In such circumstances, a PI strategy may provide an alternative reperfusion option. Adverse time delays for delivery of P-PCI should be considered when evaluating reperfusion strategies.</str>

      <str>Growth and digestion experiments were conducted to estimate the digestible P needs of terminal-cross growing-finishing pigs fed sorghum-soybean meal-based diets from 25 to 118 kg. Dietary available P levels approximated the levels recommended by the NRC (1988) or were approximately 25% above or below those levels. Up to 80 kg, dietary treatment did not affect performance; from 80 to 118 kg, the lowest P level (no inorganic P) reduced (P = .03) feed efficiency. Carcass leanness, subjective quality scores for the loin, chemical content of lean, and sensory evaluation of cooked lean were not adversely affected by decreasing P. As dietary P decreased, connective tissue amount in the lean decreased (P = .06). Ash content (P &lt; .01) and peak load (P &lt; .05) of metacarpals and metatarsals decreased as dietary P decreased, but structural soundness scores in the live pig were unaffected by treatment. Apparent digestibility of P decreased (P = .08 to P &lt; .01) as dietary P decreased in the diets. Estimated P excretions per pig decreased with decreasing dietary P up to 80 kg; during the 80-to-118-kg interval, P excretions were similar for pigs fed the two lowest P diets due to reduced feed efficiency of pigs fed the lowest P diet. Dietary digestible P contents maximizing performance and carcass merit were .21, .19, and .16% for pigs fed from 25 to 50, 50 to 80, and 80 to 118 kg, respectively. The results suggest that P excretions of terminal-cross pigs can be reduced by feeding less than current NRC recommendations for P without reducing performance, carcass merit, or structural soundness of live pigs.</str>

      <str>Adding sorbents to sediments has been suggested as an effective technology for contaminated sediment remediation. In this study, a zirconium-modified zeolite (ZrMZ) was prepared, characterized, and used as a sediment amendment to control phosphorus (P) release from eutrophic lake sediments. The efficiency of ZrMZ in immobilizing P from water and sediments was investigated through a series of experiments. The phosphate adsorption capacity for ZrMZ decreased with increasing water pH. The adsorption of phosphate on ZrMZ followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption data of phosphate on ZrMZ could be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 10.2 mg P/g at pH 7 and 25 °C. Sequential extraction of P from the phosphate-adsorbed ZrMZ suggested that most of P bound by ZrMZ existed as the NaOH extractable P (NaOH-P) and residual P (Res-P) and was unlikely to be released under natural pH and reducing conditions. The addition of ZrMZ into sediments reduced the inorganic P activity in the sediments by transforming bicarbonate-dithionite extractable P (BD-P) to NaOH-P and Res-P. The contents of bioavailable P such as water-soluble P (WS-P), NaHCO3 extractable P (Olsen-P), and algal available P (AAP) in sediments reduced after the sediments were mixed with ZrMZ, making P in the sediments more stable. The addition of ZrMZ into sediments significantly reduced the releasing flux of P from the sediments to the water column under different conditions. Results of this study indicate that the ZrMZ is a promising sediment amendment for controlling the internal P loading of lake sediments.</str>

      <str>This study was conducted to investigate the long-term effects of fire on soil phosphorus (P) and to determine the efficiency of different procedures in extracting soil P forms. Different P forms were determined: labile forms (Olsen-P, Bray-P, and P extracted by anion exchange membranes: AEM-P); moderately labile inorganic and organic P, obtained by NaOH-EDTA extraction after removing the AEM-P fraction; and total organic and inorganic soil P. (31)P-NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the structure of alkali-soluble P forms (orthophosphate, monoester, pyrophosphate, and DNA). The studied area was a Pinus pinaster forest located at Arenas de San Pedro (southern Avila, Spain). The soils were Dystric Cambisols over granites. Soil samples were collected at 0-2 cm, 2-5 cm, and 10-15 cm depths, two years after a fire in the burned area and in an adjacent unburned forest area. Fire increased the total N, organic C, total P, and organic and inorganic P content in the surface soil layer. In burned soil, the P extracted by the sequential procedure (AEM and NaOH+EDTA) was about 95% of the total P. Bray extraction revealed a fire-induced increase in the sorption surfaces. Analysis by chemical methods overestimated the organic P fraction in the EDTA-NaOH extract in comparison with the determination by ignition procedure. This overestimation was more important in the burned than unburned soil samples, probably due to humification promoted by burning, which increased P sorption by soil particles. The fire-induced changes on the structure of alkali-soluble P were an increase in orthophosphate-P and a decrease in monoester-P and DNA-P.</str>

      <str>Periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) represents a frequent complication in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization. Despite great attention focused on pharmacological prevention of periprocedural damage, very little is known about using biomarkers to potentially predict the risk of PMI. Larger platelets have been associated with enhanced reactivity, increased cardiovascular risk, and higher rates of complications after coronary stenting. The platelet-larger cell ratio (P-LCR) identifies the largest-sized fraction of platelets, the proportion potentially more closely related to thrombotic events. The present study evaluated the relationship between P-LCR and PMI. We included 1,285 patients undergoing PCI. Myonecrosis biomarkers were dosed at intervals from 6 to 48 h after PCI. Periprocedural myonecrosis was defined as troponin I increase by three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or by 50 % of an elevated baseline value, whereas PMI was defined as an increase in creatine kinase MB by 3 × ULN or 50 % of baseline. We grouped patients according to tertile values of P-LCR (&lt;27.5; ≥35.1). Higher P-LCR was associated with age (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.001), previous cerebrovascular accidents (P = 0.007), therapy with statins (P &lt; 0.001), angiotensin receptor blockers (P &lt; 0.001), aspirin (P = 0.002), and nitrates (P = 0.01). P-LCR was related to hemoglobin levels (P &lt; 0.001), and inversely related to platelet count (P &lt; 0.001) and glycemia (P = 0.05). Patients with higher P-LCR had a lower presence of coronary thrombus (P = 0.003). Higher P-LCR values did not increase the risk of PMI (P = 0.10; adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95 % confidence interval (CI)) = 0.97 (0.69-1.38)), P = 0.89) or periprocedural myonecrosis (P = 0.96; adjusted OR (95 % CI) = 1.003 (0.76-1.32), P = 0.99). Results were confirmed even in higher-risk subgroups of patients. P-LCR does not increase the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction and myonecrosis in patients undergoing coronary stenting. </str>

Western blot analysis of liver microsomes with antibodies to rat P-448-H (P-4501A2), P-450j (P-450IIE), P-450 PB-1 (P-450IIIA), and P-450b (P-450IIB1) showed that VC deficiency decreased the amount of cytochrome P-450 immunochemically related to P-450IA2 and P-450IIE but did not change the amount of the form that was cross-reactive with antibodies to P-450IIB1 and tended to slightly increase (not statistically significantly) the amount of the form of the cytochrome immunochemically related to P-450IIIA. The larger decrease by VC deficiency in the amount of cytochrome P-450 that was cross-reactive to the rat P-450IA2 resulted in a lower capacity of liver microsomes to activate promutagens, such as 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo(4,5-f)quinoline and aflatoxin B1. These results indicate that VC deficiency in guinea pigs differentially affects the content of individual forms of cytochrome P-450.</str>

      <str>The objective of this study was to show that prolonged restriction of motor activity (hypokinesia) could reduce phosphate (P) deposition and contribute to P loss with tissue P depletion. To this end, measurements were made of tissue P content, P absorption, plasma P levels, urinary and fecal P excretion of rats during and after hypokinesia (HK) and daily phosphate supplementation. Studies were conducted on male Wistar rats during a pre-hypokinetic period, a hypokinetic period and a post-hypokinetic period. All rats were equally divided into four groups: unsupplemented vivarium control rats (UVCR), unsupplemented hypokinetic rats (UHKR), supplemented vivarium control rats (SVCR) and supplemented hypokinetic rats (SHKR). Bone and muscle P content, plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, P absorption, plasma P levels and urinary and fecal P excretion did not change in SVCR and UVCR compared with their pre-HK values. During HK, plasma P levels, urinary and fecal P excretion increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) while muscle and bone P content, P absorption and plasma iPTH levels decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in SHKR and UHKR compared with their pre-HK values and the values in their respective vivarium controls (SVCR and UVCR). During the initial 9-days of post-HK, plasma, urinary and fecal P levels decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05), and plasma iPTH levels, muscle and bone P levels remained significantly (p&lt;0.05) depressed in hypokinetic rats compared with their pre-HK values and the values in their respective vivarium control rats. By the 15th day, these values approached the control values. During HK and post-HK, changes in P absorption, plasma iPTH levels, and P levels in muscle, bone, plasma, urine and feces were significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater in SHKR than in UHKR. Decreased tissue P content with increased P loss in animals receiving and not receiving P supplementation demonstrates decreased P deposition during HK. Higher P excretion with lower tissue content in SHKR and UHKR demonstrates that P deposition is decreased more with P supplementation than without. Because SHKR with a lower tissue P content showed higher P excretion than UHKR it was concluded that the risk of decreased P deposition with greater tissue P depletion is inversely related to P intake, that is, the higher the P intake the greater the risk for decreased P deposition and the greater tissue P depletion. It was shown that P (regardless of the intensity of its tissue depletion) is lost during HK unless factors contributing to the decreased P deposition are partially or totally reversed. It was concluded that dissociation between (decreased) tissue P content and (increased) P uptake indicates decreased P (absorption and) deposition as the main mechanisms of tissue P depletion during prolonged HK.</str>

      <str>The assembly of the core oligosaccharide region of asparagine-linked glycoproteins proceeds by means of the dolichol pathway. The first step of this pathway, the reaction of dolichol phosphate with UDP-GlcNAc to form N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol), is under investigation as a possible site of metabolic regulation. This report describes feedback inhibition of this reaction by the second intermediate of the pathway, N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol), and product inhibition by GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol itself. These influences were revealed when the reactions were carried out in the presence of showdomycin, a nucleoside antibiotic, present at concentrations that block the de novo formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol but not that of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. The apparent K(i) values for GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol under basal conditions were 4.4 and 2.8 microM, respectively. Inhibition was also observed under conditions where mannosyl-P-dolichol (Man-P-dol) stimulated the biosynthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol; the apparent K(i) values for GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol were 2.2 and 11 microM, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the types of inhibition indicated competitive inhibition by GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol toward the substrate UDP-GlcNAc and non-competitive inhibition toward dolichol phosphate. Inhibition by GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was uncompetitive toward UDP-GlcNAc and competitive toward dolichol phosphate. A model is presented for the kinetic mechanism of the synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol also exerts a stimulatory effect on the biosynthesis of Man-P-dol, i.e. a reciprocal relationship to that previously observed between these two intermediates of the dolichol pathway. This network of inhibitory and stimulatory influences may be aspects of metabolic control of the pathway and thus of glycoprotein biosynthesis in general.</str>

      <str>Effects of energy, protein, or both energy and protein restriction on gastrointestinal morphological development were investigated in 60 Liuyang Black kids, which were sourced from local farms and weaned at 28 d of age. Weaned kids were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 dietary treatments (15 kids per treatment), which consisted of adequate nutrient supply (CON), energy restriction (ER), protein restriction (PR), or energy and protein restriction (EPR). The entire experiment included adaptation period (0 to 6 d), nutritional restriction period (7 to 48 d), and recovery period (49 to 111 d). Three kids from each group were killed at d 48 and 111, and the rumen, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were harvested.

      <str>1-Chloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethene (p,p'-DDMU), a metabolite of either 1,1-dichloro-22-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD) or 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethene (p,p'-DDE), which is degraded from 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT), was detected in a variety of environmental matrices of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China, including fish, fish feeds, semidigested fish stomach contents, marine surface sediment, surface soil, atmospheric gaseous phase, and particulates, rainwater, and coastal rainwater. Forfish species,the concentrations of p,p'-DDMU were significantly higher in farmed fish than in marine wild fish, with the highest value obtained in seawater farmed fish species (mear/median values of 262/173 ng/g lipid). The relative abundance of p,p'-DDMU to total DDTs (sum of o,p'- and p,p'-DDT, DDD, and DDE) was higher in samples of marine origin (approximately 5%) than in those of terrestrial origin (approximately 2%). Because p,p'-DDD was considerably abundant in all samples and a negative linear correlation was found between p,p'-DDD/(p,p'-DDD + p,p'-DDE) and p,p'-DDMU/DDTs in the marine sediments (r2 = 0.73) and seawater farmed fish (r2 = 0.29) under investigation, it is possible that DDMU was partially dehydrochlorinated from DDD in the environment of the PRD. A fugacity-based assessment suggested that p,p'-DDMU is likely to transport from sediment to seawater and then to air and from soilto air. The ubiquity of p,p'-DDMU in the PRD indicates that it may also be widespread worldwide particularly in countries with large amounts of DDT used currently and/or historically. Given the potential risk of p,p'-DDMU to human health, more efforts should be directed toward to this previously overlooked contaminant</str>

      <str>We have previously shown that purified rat liver cytochromes P-450c and P-450d share some but not all immunochemical determinants (Reik, L. M., Levin, W., Ryan, D.E., and Thomas, P.E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3950-3957). Antibody to cytochrome P-450d cross-reacts with cytochrome P-450c to form an immunoprecipitin band in the Ouchterlony test, but no detectable immunoprecipitin ring is formed in a radial immunodiffusion assay. However, the addition of purified cytochrome P-450c to purified cytochrome P-450d in the radial immunodiffusion assay alters the cytochrome P-450d standard curve. Appropriate corrections have been made for the interference of cytochrome P-450c in the immunoquantitation of cytochrome P-450d. Twelve structurally diverse xenobiotics have been examined for their capacity to modulate the levels of cytochrome P-450d, as well as cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c, in rat liver microsomes. Five compounds (isosafrole, 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and phenothiazine) and the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254 are potent in vivo inducers of cytochrome P-450d (0.44-0.89 nmol of cytochrome P-450d/mg of microsomal protein). Control rats have low levels of this microsomal hemoprotein (0.04-0.05 nmol of cytochrome P-450d/mg of microsomal protein). Isosafrole induces cytochrome P-450d to a greater extent than cytochrome P-450c, Aroclor 1254 induces both hemoproteins to similar extents, and the remaining four compounds preferentially induce cytochrome P-450c relative to cytochrome P-450d. All of these structurally diverse compounds induce cytochromes P-450d and P-450c, suggesting that the inducibility of these cytochrome P-450 isozymes, but not cytochromes P-450a and P-450b, is linked.</str>

      <str>Three hundred sixty-seven cancer patients who received curative RT were investigated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at the start of RT, end of RT, and 1 and 6 months post-RT.</str>
      <str>The patients were 49 % women, 51 % men, and median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 16-86 years). Compared to pre-RT, at the end of RT, the global health status score (p &lt; 0.001), nausea/vomiting (p &lt; 0.001), and apetite loss scores (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly poorer.

      <str>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of increased morbidity and mortality for hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive values of carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions and endothelial adhesion molecule levels for long-term outcome in non-diabetic HD patients.</str>
      <str>112 HD patients (60 male, mean age 59 years) consecutively entered the study. Atherosclerotic disease was assessed by measuring the mean and maximum intima-media thickness (IMT and IMTmax respectively) of the common carotid arteries using an ultrasound scanner. Circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) levels were measured by ELISA. Patients were followed for the next 5 years and primary end points on follow-up were all-cause death, death from CVD causes and incidence of a CVD event.</str>
      <str>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that survival curves for all-cause mortality, CVD mortality and morbidity differed significantly between the upper and lower tertiles of baseline IMT (p = 0.002, p = 0.01 and p = 0.001 respectively) and IMTmax values (p = 0.0007, p = 0.006 and p = 0.0003 respectively), as well as ICAM-1 (p = 0.008, p = 0.003 and p = 0.02 respectively) and VCAM-1 levels (p = 0.004, p = 0.012 and p = 0.025 respectively). In non-adjusted analysis all-cause mortality and CVD mortality and morbidity were significantly associated with IMT (p = 0.003, p = 0.01 and p = 0.001 respectively) and IMTmax values (p = 0.001, p = 0.007 and p = 0.0007 respectively). After adjusting for other significant covariates, IMT values remained associated only with CVD morbidity (p = 0.03), while IMTmax were associated with both CVD mortality and morbidity (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01 respectively). All-cause mortality and CVD mortality and morbidity were also significantly associated with serum ICAM-1 (p = 0.004, p = 0.005 and p = 0.01 respectively) and VCAM-1 levels (p = 0.008, p = 0.02 and p = 0.03 respectively). After adjusting for the same covariates, the associations between ICAM-1 and all-cause mortality and CVD mortality and morbidity remained significant (p = 0.02, p = 0.01 and p = 0.02 respectively), while serum VCAM-1 levels were independently associated only with all-cause mortality (p = 0.02).</str>

      <str>The leaching of colloidal phosphorus (P(coll)) contributes to P losses from agricultural soils. In an irrigation experiment with undisturbed soil columns, we investigated whether the accumulation of P in soils due to excess P additions enhances the leaching of colloids and P(coll) from sandy soils. Furthermore, we hypothesized that large concentrations of P(coll) occur at the onset of leaching events and that P(coll) mobilized from topsoils is retained in subsoils. Soil columns of different P saturation and depth (0-25 and 0-40 cm) were collected at a former disposal site for liquid manure and at the Thyrow fertilization experiment in northeastern Germany. Concentrations of total dissolved P, P(coll), Fe(coll), Al(coll), optical density, zeta potential, pH, and electrical conductivity of the leachates were determined. Colloidal P concentrations ranged from 0.46 to 10 micromol L(-1) and contributed between 1 and 37% to total P leaching. Large P(coll) concentrations leached from the P-rich soil of the manure disposal site were rather related to a large P-content of colloids than to the mobilization of additional colloids. Concentrations of colloids and P(coll) in leachates from P-poor and P-rich columns from Thyrow did not differ significantly. In contrast, accumulation of P in the Werbellin and the Thyrow soil consistently increased dissolved P concentrations to maximum values as high as 300 micromol L(-1). We observed no first-flush of colloids and P(coll) at the beginning of the leaching event. Concentrations of P(coll) leached from 40-cm soil columns were not smaller than those leached from 25-cm columns. Our results illustrate that an accumulation of P in sandy soils does not necessarily lead to an enhanced leaching of colloids and P(coll), because a multitude of factors independent from the P status of soils control the mobility of colloids. In contrast, P accumulation generally increases dissolved P concentrations in noncalcareous soils due to the saturation of the P sorption capacity. This indicates that leaching of dissolved P might be a more widespread environmental problem in areas with P-saturated sandy soils than leaching of P(coll).</str>

      <str>Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias associated with not only increased morbidity after coronary artery bypass grafting but also increased healthcare costs. Many factors are associated with atrial fibrillation onset after coronary artery bypass grafting. We prospectively examined which factors could predict atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.</str>
      <str>Fifty-seven consecutive patients (37 men, mean age=60.2+/-12 years) with sinus rhythm before coronary artery bypass grafting are included the study. Clinical, demographic, laboratory and echocardiographic characteristics are all evaluated prospectively. The maximum and minimum P-wave duration (P(max) and P(min)) were measured from the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram. The difference between the P(max) and the P(min) was calculated and defined as P-wave dispersion. Preoperative venous blood samples were taken for N-terminal proBrain natriuretic peptide level analysis.</str>
      <str>Ten (17%) patients had postoperative atrial fibrillation. Patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation were older (69.4+/-6 versus 58.2+/-12 years, P=0.01), had lower ejection fraction (44.1+/-8.9% versus 54.3+/-9; P=0.002), higher proBrain natriuretic peptide levels (538+/-136 pg/ml versus 293+/-359 pg/ml; P=0.03), longer P(max) (142.2+/-13.7 ms versus 120.8+/-21.2 ms; P=0.006) and longer P-wave dispersion (55.0+/-8.2 ms versus 41.3+/-14.3 ms; P=0.008) compared with the patients without atrial fibrillation. Univariate analysis showed that increased age (P=0.01), lower ejection fraction (P=0.02), enlargement of left atrium (P=0.02), increased P(max) (P=0.006) and increased P-wave dispersion (P=0.008) and increased level of preoperative proBrain natriuretic peptide (P=0.03) were associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation. Positive correlation was seen between the age and level of proBrain natriuretic peptide (r=0.322 and P=0.015). In multivariate analysis, age (P=0.05), lower ejection fraction (P=0.03), left atrial enlargement (P=0.05), longer P(max) (P=0.01) and P-wave dispersion (P=0.01) were found to be independent predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation.</str>

      <str>The rapid growth and intensification of freshwater fishery can cause imbalances between phosphorus (P) input in feed and its output in produce. This aquaculture can result in enriching exogenous P in fishponds and, consequently, accelerates the process of eutrophication. To assess relations among input, accumulation, release of P and as a consequence degrading water quality in terms of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in freshwater fishponds, fourteen fishponds with feed supply, nine fishponds without feed supply, and five non-fish ponds in Shaoxing Plain, southeast China were selected for comparing P accumulation in their waters and surface sediments. Surface sediment samples were collected from each pond to evaluate their total P, water soluble P, Olsen P, algal available P, and P fractions. Water samples were also collected from the ponds to measure concentrations of dissolved P and Chl-a. Total P in the sediments ranged from 0.88 to 1.73 g/kg in the fishponds with feed supply, that in the non-fish ponds ranged from 0.47 to 0.86 g/kg. Organic P, accounted for 23% to 60% of total P in the sediments, was an important P fraction and increased linearly with increasing organic matter. Long-term application of feeds resulted in increased P availability in the bottom sediments and degradation of water quality in the freshwater fishponds. Compared with non-fish ponds, sediments from the feed-supplied fishponds contained considerably higher Olsen P, algal available P, and water soluble P. Higher proportions of the labile P (NH4Cl-P) and potentially labile P (NaOH-IP) were also found in the sediments from the fishponds. High solubility of P in the sediments resulted in elevation of P and chlorophyll-a concentration in the pond water. The dissolved P concentration in the pond water increased in the order of non-fish ponds (12 microg/L) &lt; fishponds without feed supply (24 microg/L) &lt; fishponds with feed supply (66 microg/L). Linear correlations between concentrations of total P, Olsen-P, algal available P, water-soluble P and P concentration in saturation extracts in the sediments and dissolved P in the pond water indicated that there was a buffering action of the sediment constituents on the dissolved P.</str>

      <str>Rat liver microsomal fraction synthesized Ret-P-Man (retinyl phosphate mannose) and Dol-P-Man (dolichyl phosphate mannose) from endogenous Ret-P (retinyl phosphate) and Dol-P (dolichyl phosphate). Ret-P-Man synthesis displayed an absolute requirement for a bivalent cation, and also Dol-P-Man synthesis was stimulated by bivalent metal ions. Mn2+ and Co2+ were the most active, with maximum synthesis of Ret-P-Man occurring at 5-10 mM: Mg2+ was also active, but at higher concentrations. At 5mM-Mn2+ the amount of endogenous Ret-P mannosylated in incubation mixtures containing 5 microM-GDP-mannose in 15 min at 37 degrees C was approx. 3 pmol/mg of protein. In the same assays about 7-10 pmol of endogenous Dol-P was mannosylated. Bivalentcation requirement for Ret-P-Man synthesis from exogenous Ret-P showed maximum synthesis at 2.5 mM-Mn2+ or -Co2+. In addition to Ret-P-Man and Dol-P-Man, a mannolipid co-chromatographing with undecaprenyl phosphate mannose was detected. Triton X-100 (0.5%) abolished Ret-P-Man synthesis from endogenous Ret-P and caused a 99% inhibition of Ret-P-Man synthesis from exogenous Ret-P. The presence of detergent (0.5%) also inhibited Dol-P-Man synthesis from endogenous Dol-P and altered the requirement for Mn2+. Microsomal fraction from Syrian golden hamsters was also active in Ret-P-Man and Dol-P-Man synthesis from endogenous Ret-P and Dol-P. At 5 mM-Mn2+ about 2.5 pmol of endogenous Ret-P and 3.7 pmol of endogenous Dol-P were mannosylated from GDP-mannose per mg of protein in 15 min at 37 degrees C. On the other hand, microsomal fraction from vitamin A-deficient hamsters contained 1.2 pmol of Ret-P and 14.1 pmol of Dol-P available for mannosylation. Since GDP-mannose: Ret-P and GDP-mannose: Dol-P mannosyltransferase activities were not affected, depletion of vitamin A must affect Ret-P and Dol-P pools in opposite ways.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) in RNA accounts for half or more of the total non-storage P in oxygenic photolithotrophs grown in either P-replete or P-limiting growth conditions. Since many natural environments are P-limited for photosynthetic primary productivity, and peak phosphorus fertilizer production is inevitable, the paper analyses what economies in P allocation to RNA could, in principle, increase P-use efficiency of growth (rate of dry matter production per unit organism P). The possibilities of decreasing P allocation to RNA without decreasing growth rate include (1) more widespread down-regulation of RNA production in P-limited organisms, (2) optimal allocation of P to RNA, both spatially among cell compartments and organs, and temporally depending on the stage of growth, and (3) a constant rate of protein synthesis through the diel cycle. Acting on these suggestions would, however, be technically demanding. </str>

      <str>We report a high statistics measurement of Upsilon production with an 800 GeV/c proton beam on hydrogen and deuterium targets. The dominance of the gluon-gluon fusion process for Upsilon production at this energy implies that the cross section ratio, sigma(p+d--&gt;Upsilon)/2sigma(p+p--&gt;Upsilon), is sensitive to the gluon content in the neutron relative to that in the proton. Over the kinematic region 0&lt;x(F)&lt;0.6, this ratio is found to be consistent with unity, in striking contrast to the behavior of the Drell-Yan cross section ratio sigma(p+d)(DY)/2sigma(p+p)(DY). This result shows that the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron are very similar. The Upsilon production cross sections are also compared with the p+d and p+Cu cross sections from earlier measurements.</str>

In vitro, P-N had a wider spectrum of antibacterial activity than did either P or N. Similar results were also obtained in vivo, using the mouse protection test. The P-N gave a greater protection rate in mice experimentally infected with S aureus and Str agalactiae than did P or N.</str>

      <str>Visible mould from 225 blocks of the Norwegian semi-hard cheeses Jarlsberg and Norvegia from four factories were subcultured and identified. Altogether 23 different fungal species were detected. The two most important contaminating species were Penicillium commune and P. palitans, constituting 21.4% and 17.9% of the total isolates, respectively. The other dominating contaminants were P. roqueforit spp. roqueforti, Geotrichum candidum, P. solitum and P. crustosum. These species, together with P. commune and P. palitans, represented 80.9% of the total isolates. P. commune, P. palitans, P. roqueforti spp. roqueforti and P. solitum were most common contaminants on cheese produced in all four factories, while G. candidum was found to be important on Jarlsberg cheese from only one factory.

The assay is based on the repartition of anti-substance P antibodies between the insoluble phase-immobilized substance P and the free peptide. The immobilized substance P-antibody complex is then quantified with 125I-protein A. The method allowed detection of 10 pg of substance P. The values of substance P concentration obtained by the present method in different regions of the rat brain were comparable to those obtained by standard radioimmunoassay with 125I-tyr-8-substance P as tracer. The described solid-phase radioimmunoassay is a simple, sensitive, and reliable technique for quantification of substance P-like immunoreactivity in biological samples.</str>

The guanine-plus-cytosine contents of P. anatipestifer ranged from 32 to 35 mole %, whereas those of Moraxella and Pasteurella spp. were much higher, ranging from 40 to 45 mole %. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that homology of nine P. anatipestifer strains to strains ATCC 11845 and PA 15 was 52 to 100%, whereas homology of Moraxella and Pasteurella strains to these strains was only 3 to 17%. Similarly, homology of P. anatipestifer strains, Moraxella, and Pasteurella species other than P. multocida to P. multocida reference strain P-2192 was low.

      <str>p-Quinodimethanes (p-QDMs) are reactive molecules that have been invoked as transient intermediates in a number of reactions. Dilute solutions of benzene-based p-QDMs, p-xylylene (1), alpha-methyl-p-xylylene (10), and 2,5-dimethyl-p-xylylene (11) can be prepared by fluoride-induced elimination of trimethylsilyl acetate from the appropriate precursor. It has been found that these solutions are stable enough to allow these reactive p-QDMs to be observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy at room temperature. For the first time, the 13C NMR spectrum of p-QDM 1 was observed. After several hours at room temperature, these p-QDMs form dimers, trimers, and insoluble oligomers. Formation of trimers provides evidence that p-QDMs 1, 10, and 11 dimerize by a stepwise mechanism involving dimeric diradicals as intermediates.</str>

Washed cell of Escherichia coli, the resting culture and the homogenate of disintegrated cells transform p-NCB into p-chloroaniline (p-CA). The growing culture of E. coli (Eh = -210 mV) reduces the nitro group of p-NCB. If E. coli cells are separated from the cultural broth under strictly anaerobic conditions, the redox potential rises abruptly (Eh = -110 mV); the filtrate does not transform p-NCB into p-Ca. The rate at which E. coli reduces the nitro group of p-NCB depends on the redox potential of the medium.

      <str>Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a major cause of multidrug resistance in cancer. P-gp is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and can efflux structurally and chemically unrelated substrates, including anticancer drugs. P-gp is also localized in intracellular compartments, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes, and cycles between endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane in a microtubular-actin dependent manner. Intracellular trafficking pathways for P-gp and participation of different Rab proteins depend on cellular polarization and choice of primary culture, cell line or neoplasm. Interruption of P-gp trafficking to the plasma membrane increases intracellular P-gp accumulation and anticancer drug levels, suggesting a potential approach to overcome P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance in cancer.</str>

      <str>The short-chain acids of 36 strains of Pseudomonas grown on Trypticase soy agar were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Distinct acid profiles were observed for each of the eight species tested. Propionic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids were the principal acids detected in media extracts of P. maltophilia, P. cepacia, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. diminuta, and P. vesiculare. The presence and relative amounts of the isobutyric and isovaleric acids clearly distinguished P. maltophilia, P. pseudoalcaligenes, and P. cepacia from other species. P. diminuta could be distinguished from P. vesiculare by the production of glutaric acid; P. testosteroni was the only species tested which produced relatively large amounts of phenylacetic acid.</str>

      <str>The pesticide DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(chlorodiphenyl)ethane] is 1 of the 12 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under negotiation at the Stockholm Convention to restrict or ban their production and use because of their toxicity, resistance to breakdown, bioaccumulation, and potential for being transported over long distances. DDT has estrogenic potential, and the main metabolite, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), is a potent antiandrogen. In response to mounting evidence on the endocrine-disrupting influence of environmental chemicals on human health, this epidemiological study was initiated to test the hypothesis that nonoccupational exposure to DDT affects male reproductive parameters. In a cross-sectional study, healthy male subjects (n=311) between 18 and 40 years (23+/-5) of age were recruited from 3 communities in an endemic malaria area in which DDT is sprayed annually. A semen analysis according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards was performed. The Hamilton Thorne Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) system was simultaneously used to determine additional sperm motility parameters. Blood plasma samples were assayed for p,p'-DDT and metabolites as a measure of exposure. The exposure levels were expressed as lipid-adjusted p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE values. The mean p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE concentrations were 90.23 microg/g(+/-102.4) and 215.47 microg/g(+/-210.6), respectively. The multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that mean CASA motility was lower with a higher p,p'-DDE concentration (beta=-0.02, P=.001) and the CASA parameter beat cross-frequency (BCF) was higher with a higher p,p'-DDT concentration (beta=0.01, P=.000). There was also a statistically significant positive association between percent sperm with cytoplasmic droplets and p,p'-DDT concentration (beta=0.0014, P=.014). The ejaculate volume (mean 1.9+/-1.33 mL) was lower than the normal range (&gt;or=2.0 mL) according to WHO, and a significant decrease with increasing p,p'-DDE values was seen for both square root-transformed volume (beta=-0.0003; P=.024) and count (beta=-0.003; P=.04). Although there were no associations between either p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE concentrations and the rest of the seminal parameters, the incidence of teratozoospermia (99%; normal sperm&lt;15%) was high. Twenty-eight percent of the study group presented with oligozoospermia (&lt;20x10(6) sperm/mL), which had a significant positive association with p,p'-DDE (odds ratio [OR]=1.001, P=.03). There was a significant positive association between participants with asthenozoospermia (32%) and p,p'-DDT (OR 1.003, P=.006) and p,p'-DDE (OR 1.001, P=.02). The results imply that nonoccupational exposure to DDT is associated with impaired seminal parameters in men. The high exposure levels of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE are of concern because these levels could have far-reaching implications for reproductive and general health.</str>

      <str>Stealth PLGA/Liposome nanoparticles (NPs) modified with tumor-targeting single-chain antibody fragment (scFV-P/L) for systemic delivery of recombinant methioninase (rMETase) for gastric cancer were prepared. The morphologies and therapeutic effects of rMETase-loaded scFV-P/L (scFV-rMETase-P/L) in vitro were analyzed. Functional scFV-P/L NPs composed of PLGA, DOPC and DSPE-PEG display low cell cytoxicity in SGC-7901 cells, and has more cell uptake ability than P/L NPs. scFV-rMETase-P/L was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in the subcutaneous gastric carcinoma tumor model than free rMETase in solution (p &lt; 0.05) and rMETase-loaded P/L (rMETase-P/L) (p &lt; 0.05).

      <str>This paper describe the renal pathology in Aotus trivirgatus (owl monkeys) following P. falciparum infections and also when the initial P. falciparum was followed by infection with P. malariae or P. brrasilianum. Acute P. falciparum infections were associted with high parasitaemia but relatively mild changes in the glomeruli. This was also the case when a second infection with P. falciparum was given after the first infection had been terminated with chloroquine. Four monkeys with multiple infections involving P. Malariae or P. brasilianum after P. falciparum showed a glomerulonephritis. Two of these also showed a necrotizing arteriolitis. The findings suggest that P. falciparum alone does not give progressive renal disease and that this is more likely to occur with mixed infections.</str>

      <str>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ribonucleoprotein comprised of a catalytic RNA subunit and one or several protein subunits. RNase P is best known for its role in 5'-processing of tRNA precursors. RNase P enzymes from almost all forms of life, including protein-synthesizing organelles, contain an RNase P with a conserved, homologous RNA. Five distinct structure classes of RNase P RNAs have been identified in bacteria and archaea; eukaryotic RNase P RNAs are not yet sufficiently well surveyed for structure classes to be defined. Here we will examine the structure variations in RNase P RNAs in bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, plastids and mitochondria with special emphasis on the functional roles these unique secondary structures perform.</str>

The new four polymorphs, together with five additional hybrid polymorphs, greatly enrich the phosphorene structures, and their stabilities are confirmed by first-principles calculations. In particular, the θ-P is shown to be equally stable as the α-P (black) and more stable than all previously reported phosphorene polymorphs. Prediction of nonvolatile ferroelastic switching and structural transformation among different polymorphs under strains points out their potential applications via strain engineering. </str>

In the rhizosphere soil of pure C. lanceolata and P. massoniana plantations, the content of available P was higher than that in non-rhizosphere soil. As compared with non-rhizosphere soil, the rhizophere soil in the three plantations had lower pH and O-P content but higher Al-P and Fe-P contents, and its P adsorption capacity was lower while the P desorption rate and desorbed P were in adverse. In the rhizophere soil of pure P. massoniana plantation, the contents of available P, Fe-P, and Al-P, their desorption rates, and desorption capacity were higher, but the O-P content and the adsorbed P were lower, as compared with those in the rhizophere soil of pure C. lanceolata plantation. In the mixed plantation, the P activation in rhizophere soil was further improved, being more obvious under C. lanceolata, which suggested that mixed plantation of C. lanceolata and P. massoniana could promote the phosphorus nutrition of C. lanceolata.</str>

DNA was extracted from a set of isolates visually recognized as Penicillium, and the internal transcribed spacer region and partial LSU-rDNA was amplified and sequenced. Comparison of DNA sequences with GenBank and unpublished sequences revealed the presence of 11 known Penicillium species: P. brevicompactum, P. brocae, P. cecidicola, P. citrinum, P. coffeae, P. crustosum, P. janthinellum, P. olsonii, P. oxalicum, P. sclerotiorum and P. steckii as well as two possibly undescribed species near P. diversum and P. roseopurpureum.

      <str>Equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) calculations have been performed to evaluate three-bond (15)N-(31)P coupling constants ((3h)J(N[bond]P)) across N[bond]H....O[bond]P hydrogen bonds in model cationic and anionic complexes including NH(4)(+):OPH, NH(4)(+):OPH(3), NH(3):(-)O(2)PH(2), NFH(2):(-)O(2)PH(2), and NF(2)H:(-)O(2)PH(2). Three-bond coupling constants can be appreciable when the phosphorus is P(V), but are negligible with P(III). (3h)J(N[bond]P) values in complexes with cyclic or open structures are less than 1 Hz, a consequence of the nonlinear arrangement of N, H, O, and P atoms. For complexes with these structures, (3h)J(N[bond]P) may not be experimentally measurable. In contrast, complexes in which the N, H, O, and P atoms are collinear or nearly collinear have larger values of (3h)J(N[bond]P), even though the N[bond]P distances are longer than N[bond]P distances in cyclic and open structures. In linear complexes, (3h)J(N[bond]P) is dominated by the Fermi-contact term, which is distance dependent. Therefore, N[bond]P (and hydrogen-bonding N[bond]O) distances in these complexes can be determined from experimentally measured (15)N-(31)P coupling constants.</str>

      <str>Efficient use of phosphorus (P) for producing food, preventing water pollution, and managing a dwindling rock P reserve are major challenges for China. We analyzed P stocks and flows in the Chinese food chain to identify where P use efficiency can be improved, where P leaks to the environment, and the research, technologies, and policies needed to improve P use. We found a high degree of inefficiency; of 6652 Gg P entering the food chain, only 1102 Gg P (18%) exit as food for humans. The greatest inefficiencies were a large build-up of soil P (3670 Gg P yr; 52% of P inputs) and high P losses to the environment from animal production (1582 Gg P yr; 60% of excreted P). Improving P use in China must focus on national-scale nutrient management strategies, better animal nutrition, and adoption of technologies and policies to reduce P discharges from the animal sector and recycle P as manures in agriculture.</str>

      <str>The amount of colonic substance P and substance P-receptors is increased in ulcerative colitis, which may denote that substance-P is involved as a neurogenic mediator in the inflammatory process of ulcerative colitis. We studied the anatomical distribution of elevated colonic substance P in ulcerative colitis and assessed morphometrically whether the changes in substance P correlate with alterations in colonic innervation. Full-thickness specimens of colonic wall were obtained from normal human colons (N = 9) and the most and least affected regions of ulcerative colitis colons (N = 10) and immunostained for substance P. Substance P immunoreactivity index was calculated by multiplying each intensity value by the number of pixels exhibiting this intensity value. The numbers of substance P-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the lamina propria were markedly increased, and their fluorescence intensity was enhanced in ulcerative colitis. The longitudinal muscle layer contained substance P-immunoreactive nerve fibers in ulcerative colitis, but not in the controls. The substance P-immunoreactive index (= number x intensity of nerve fibers) was 3.42 +/- 1.49 in controls, 21.19 +/- 7.79 in mild ulcerative colitis regions (P &lt; 0.05), and 29.68 +/- 9.81 in severe ulcerative colitis regions (P &lt; 0.01). Increase in the number of substance P nerve fibers is in accordance with the hypothesis that substance P contributes to neurogenic mediation of inflammation in ulcerative colitis.</str>

      <str>Penicillium marneffei (ATCC 24100) was first isolated from a naturally acquired human infection in the U.S.A. by DiSalvo et al. in 1973. In 1979, this isolate was studied by Pitt who reidentified it as Penicillium primulinum. This prompted us to examine the antigenic relationship between P. marneffei and P. primulinum by comparing their exoantigens. The antigenic relationships of 11 isolates, including the type strains of P. marneffei and P. primulinum, were examined. Each exoantigen extract was tested simultaneously against rabbit anti-P. marneffei and P. primulinum antisera in the presence of the appropriate reference antigens. All eight isolates of P. marneffei, including ATCC 24100, produced two to four specific precipitin lines against their homologous antiserum. However, four of the eight extracts cross-reacted with unabsorbed antiserum to P. primulinum. The P. primulinum extracts contained specific exoantigens which only reacted with the anti-P. primulinum antiserum. Non-specific cross-reactions were eliminated by absorption procedures. On the basis of the specific exoantigens produced by both species, P. marneffei and P. primulinum were found to be antigenically distinct. Isolate ATCC 24100 was shown to be closely related to the other P. marneffei isolates and distinct from P. primulinum. Our results confirm the original identification of ATCC 24100 as P. marneffei and not P. primulinum as Pitt had concluded.</str>

      <str>This study examines the regulation of progesterone receptor (PR) in the inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Ovariectomized ewes underwent hypothalamic-pituitary disconnection, were pulsed with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and received 1 of 4 treatments: estradiol alone (E), estradiol priming before progesterone (E+P), E removed and replaced with P (E-P), or no steroids (C). P treatment for 24 h, with E or following E-priming, reduced LH pulse amplitude by 55% (p&lt;0.05). E alone did not affect LH release. E increased pituitary cytosolic P binding capacity fourfold over controls (p&lt;0.01) and P further increased binding to eight times controls (p&lt;0.01). Pituitary PR mRNA increased to 149 and 171% of C in E and E+P groups, respectively (p&lt;0.05), but E removal resulted in PR mRNA levels not different from controls. Pituitary receptors for GnRH were tripled by E alone compared to C (p&lt;0.01), whereas P alone or with E had no effect. These data suggest an E-induced, direct pituitary inhibition of LH secretion by P and that this effect of P is associated with E-enhanced binding of P in the pituitary. Additionally, the direct pituitary effects of P on LH secretion cannot be accounted for by influences on GnRH receptor numbers.</str>

      <str>Heme-external ligand interactions of P-450nor were examined spectrophotometrically and compared with those of other P-450s. Most nitrogenous ligands induced type II spectral changes on binding to ferric P-450nor, as did other P-450s. In contrast with other P-450s, 2-methylpyridine and 1-butanol induced type I changes in the spectrum of P-450nor. No spectral interaction of ferrous P-450nor with these ligands was observed. The absorption spectra of the alkyl isocyanide complexes of ferrous P-450nor exhibited the Soret peak at 427 nm with a slight shoulder at around 455 nm at neutral pH, and this shoulder was intensified as the pH was increased, suggesting that the isocyanide complexes of P-450nor existed in two states (the 430 and 455 nm states) which were in pH-dependent equilibrium in a similar manner to microsomal P-450s. However, the equilibrium was shifted mostly to the 430 nm state in the complexes of P-450nor. The findings suggest that P-450nor, especially its ferrous form, has some distinct features from P-450cam and microsomal P-450s in the distal heme environment.</str>

      <str>The association between aortic dissection and paraplegia or paraparesis (P/P) after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair is not clear.</str>
      <str>Six hundred sixty patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair from 1986 through 1995 using selective atriodistal bypass, liberal reattachment of critical intercostal arteries, moderate heparinization, and permissive mild hypothermia. Dissection was present in 163 patients (24.7%) and absent in 497 (75.3%).</str>
      <str>Early mortality occurred in 7.4% overall, and did not differ between patients with nondissection, acute dissection, or chronic dissection. The incidence of P/P was 5.4% overall, 5.5% without dissection, and 5.0% with dissection. The risk of P/P for acute versus chronic dissection was 19% versus 2.9%, respectively (p = 0.011). Rupture and Crawford extent II were predictive of the development of P/P. In patients at high risk for P/P (ie, Crawford extent I or II), atriodistal bypass reduced the intercostal artery ischemic time, and reattachment of critical intercostal arteries (T8 to L1) reduced the incidence of P/P.</str>
      <str>Acute dissection increases the risk of P/P after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair; using contemporary methods, however, chronic dissection does not increase the risk of postoperative P/P.

Dogs were paced from the right atrium (control 1) or right ventricle by use of single (control 2) and then paired pacing to evaluate the effects of left ventricular contraction on P(LCx) and U(LCx). During left ventricular isovolumic contraction, P(LCx) exceeded P(Ao), paired pacing increasing the difference. Paired pacing increased DeltaP(X) (the P(LCx)-P(Ao) difference at the P(Ao)-P(LV) crossover) and average dP(LCx)/dt (P &lt; 0.0001 for both). During this time, WIA identified a backward-going compression wave (BCW) that increased P(LCx) and decreased U(LCx); the BCW increased during paired pacing (P &lt; 0.0001). After the aortic valve opened, the increase in P(Ao) caused a forward-going compression wave that, when it exceeded the BCW, caused U(LCx) to increase, despite P(LV) and (presumably) elastance continuing to increase. Thus WIA identifies the contributions of upstream (aortic) and downstream (microcirculatory) effects on P(LCx) and U(LCx).</str>

      <str>Serum lactoferrin level, using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, was estimated in 298 leprosy patients admitted into the hospital and attending the out-patient department of the Schieffelin Leprosy Research and Training Center. Serum from an equal number of non-leprosy individuals served as control. Mean (SD) of serum lactoferrin in non-leprosy individuals was 0.277 (0-092) microg/ml while in leprosy patients it was 0.494 (0.394) microg/ml, the difference being significant (P=0.0001). Serum lactoferrin levels were not significantly associated with type 2 reactions (P=0.613). Serum lactoferrin was significantly associated with age (P = 0.006), duration of the disease (P=0.0001), DDS monotherapy (P =0.007), deformity (P= 0.005), average bacterial index (BI) (P=0.01) and smear positivity (P=0.0001), orbicularis oculi weakness (P= 0.001), lagophthalmos (P = 0.002), corneal opacity (P = 0.001) and cataract (P=0.004) in simple regression analysis. All these variables, with the exception of smear positivity (P=0.019), lost their significance (P&gt;0.05) when analysed using multiple regression. Serum lactoferrin showed poor association with type 1 (P = 0.286) and type II reactions (P = 0.613) and iridocyclitis (P = 0.207). We conclude that serum lactoferrin is strongly and inversely associated with increasing BI but does not show significant association with type 2 reactions.</str>

About 23% of P-gp-ANLL obtained complete remission, which was significantly lower than that (76%) in P-gp-cases.</str>
      <str>P-gp expression is higher in refractory ANLL cases than that in cases at diagnosis or at remission. P-gp is an index of poor prognosis in adults with ANLL. P-gp+ ANLL cases have unique clinical and biological characteristics.</str>

In CH2Cl2, the dmape complexes exist as equilibrium mixtures of MCl2(P,P'-dmape) and [MCl(P,P',N-dmape)]Cl isomers (M = Pd, Pt), governed by deltaH(o) = -19 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1) and deltaS(o) = -100 +/- 30 J mol(-1) K(-1) for M = Pt, and deltaH(o) = -11 +/- 7 kJ mol(-1) and deltaS(o) = -60 +/- 20 J mol(-1) K(-1) for M = Pd. The water-soluble dmapcp complexes exist solely in the [MCl(P,P',N-dmapcp)]Cl form, but the free and coordinated anilinyl rings in these complexes are in slow diastereoselective exchange. X-ray crystal structures for MCl2(P,P'-dmape) (M = Pd, Pt), and the [PdCl(P,P',N-dmape)]+ and [PtCl(P,P',N-dmapcp)]+ cations, are presented. Some of the complexes show marginal activity in water for the catalyzed hydration of maleic to malic acid, giving about 6-7% conversion in 24 h at 100 degrees C and substrate:catalyst loadings of 100:1. Attempts to synthesize a PdCl(P,P',N-dmapm)+ species led instead to isolation of [Pd(mu-Cl)(P,P'-dmapm)]2[PF6]2 (dmapm = Ar2PCH2Ar2).</str>

      <str>The bonding properties and the potential energy surfaces for the chemical reactions of doubly bonded compounds that have the &gt;E13═E15&lt; pattern are studied using density functional theory (M06-2X/Def2-SVPD). Nine molecules, &gt;E13═P&lt; (E13 = B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl) and &gt;B═E15&lt; (E15 = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi), are used as model reactants in this work. Four types of chemical reactions, H2 addition, acetonitrile, benzophenone [2 + 2] cycloadditions, and dimethylbutadiene [4 + 2] cycloaddition, are used to study the chemical reactivity of these inorganic, ethylene-like molecules. The results of these theoretical analyses show that only the &gt;B═P&lt; molecule has a weak B═P double bond, while the &gt;Al═P&lt; , &gt;Ga═P&lt; , &gt;In═P&lt; , &gt;Tl═P&lt; , &gt;B═N&lt; , &gt;B═As&lt;, &gt;B═Sb&lt;, and &gt;B═Bi&lt; compounds are best described as having a strong single σ bond, instead of a traditional p-p π bond. The theoretical results also show that the singlet-triplet energy gap can be used to determine the relative reactivity of these doubly bonded molecules. According to these theoretical investigations, it is predicted that the order of reactivity is as follows: B═P &gt; Al═P &gt; Ga═P &gt; In═P &gt; Tl═P and B═N ≪ B═P &lt; B═As &lt; B═Sb &lt; B═Bi.

Using Cradock-Watson's set of indicator and producer strains, the isolates were tested for proticine production (P type) and for proticine sensitivity (S type). P. vulgaris was typable by the P method in 4.1%, by the S method in 41.6%. The respective percentages for P. mirabilis were 60.1 and 48.9. Most strains of P. morganii, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans were untypable by both methods. A correlation has been demonstrated between P/S types and certain serogroups and serotypes of P. mirabilis. It has been concluded that, in combination with the determination of O and H antigens, the P/S method of proticine typing has a high differentiating value in the epidemiological tracing of P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis.</str>

      <str>Mannosyl-P-dolichol (man-P-dol) has been shown to stimulate the early reactions of the dolichol pathway, specifically, the biosynthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dol, and thus may play a regulatory role in glycoprotein biosynthesis. The site of action of man-P-dol has previously been suggested to be the GlcNAc-transferase concerned with the formation of the monoglucosaminyl derivative. Since the concentration of the chitobiosyl compound also increases as a result of the presence of man-P-dol, the immediate site of the activation was reexamined. The effect of man-P-dol on the formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dol using GlcNAc-P-P-dol synthesized in situ or added exogenously as the substrate was investigated. In addition, the distribution of radioactivity in the glucosaminyl constituents of the products under the stimulatory conditions was determined. The results of these studies supported the conclusion that the stimulation of GlcNAc-lipid synthesis by man-P-dol is due to the enhanced synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dol. It is not a result of the activation of the GlcNAc-transferase catalyzing the attachment of the second GlcNAc residue for the biosynthesis of the chitobiosyl derivative.</str>

      <str>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prognostic factors of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The treatment results such as distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival of 59 previously untreated patients were retrospectively analysed. Median follow-up was 17.5 months (3.8-88.5 months). Overall survival was 22.4 months (3-87 months). Distant metastasis developed in 35 (59%) patients. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (P=0.022), tumour size (P=0.025) and lymphatic invasion (P&lt;0.0001) were significantly effective prognostic factors for distant metastasis-free survival on multivariate analysis. Related to overall survival, gender (P=0.025), ECOG performance status (P=0.027), nuclear grade (P=0.002), tumour size (P=0.029), T stage (P=0.044), nodal involvement (P=0.003), surgical margin (P=0.046), renal sinus invasion (P&lt;0.0001), perineural growth (P=0.001) and lymphatic invasion (P&lt;0.0001) were significant prognostic factors on univariate analysis. Gender (P=0.008), ECOG performance status (P=0.027), tumour size (P=0.025) and lymphatic invasion (P&lt;0.0001) retained their significance on multivariate analysis.

      <str>Administered intrathecally (IT) to mice, the putative substance P antagonist [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9-substance P (DPDT) blocked substance P- and serotonin-induced reciprocal hindlimb scratching with ID50 values of 4.6 (2.9-6.9) and 3.0 (1.9-4.8) micrograms, respectively. The duration of this antagonistic effect was 90-120 min. In contrast, DPDT did not block bombesin-, somatostatin-, glycine- or glutamate-induced scratching. These data indicate that DPDT is an effective antagonist of serotonin-induced behaviors in the mouse spinal cord. Phenoxybenzamine (IT) also blocked substance P- and serotonin-induced scratching. Its onset of action was more rapid for serotonin than for DPDT implying differences in agonist-induced receptor activation. Methysergide (IT) blocked serotonin-induced scratching [ID50 = 0.7 (0.3-1.5) micrograms], but not substance P-induced scratching. Similar to DPDT, [D-Arg1,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P, [des-Arg1,D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]-substance P(2-11) and [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9]-substance P(4-11) blocked substance P and serotonin-induced scratching. In contrast, [D-Pro2,D-Phe7,D-Trp9]-substance P and [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,10]-substance P(4-11) blocked only substance P-induced scratching. Thus, some, but not all putative substance P antagonists may also be behavioral antagonists of serotonin in the mouse spinal cord.</str>

Also, cockroaches exposed to sublethal doses of p,p' -DDT and p,p' -methoxychlor were found to exhibit repetitive firing in the abdominal nerve cord three weeks after injection of the pesticide.

      <str>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) catalyzes the 5' maturation of precursor tRNA transcripts and, in bacteria, is composed of a catalytic RNA and a protein. We investigated the oligomerization state and the shape of the RNA alone and the holoenzyme of Bacillus subtilis RNase P in the absence of substrate by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering and affinity retention. The B. subtilis RNase P RNA alone is a monomer; however, the scattering profile changes upon the addition of monovalent ions, possibly suggesting different interdomain angles. To our surprise, the X-ray scattering data combined with the affinity retention results indicate that the holoenzyme contains two RNase P RNA and two RNase P protein molecules. We propose a structural model of the holoenzyme with a symmetrical arrangement of the two RNA subunits, consistent with the X-ray scattering results. This (P RNA)2(P protein)2 complex likely binds substrate differently than the conventional (P RNA)1(P protein)1 complex; therefore, the function of the B. subtilis RNase P holoenzyme may be more diverse than previously thought. These revisions to our knowledge of the RNase P holoenzyme suggest a more versatile role for proteins in ribonucleoprotein complexes.</str>

Immunopurification of cytochromes P-450 1A1, 2B1 and 2E1 from rat liver microsomes resulted in co-purification of cytochrome b5 with cytochrome P-450 forms 2B1 and 2E1 but not 1A1. This specificity was evaluated in conjunction with multiple sequence alignment of the three cytochrome P-450s and a molecular model of the cytochrome P-450-cytochrome b5 complex [(1989) Biochemistry 28, 8201-8205]. These analyses suggest two basic residues in the arginine cluster region of P-450, which are present in P-450s 2B1 and 2E1 but are absent in P-450 1A1, as potential binding sites for cytochrome b5.</str>

Using antibodies directed against cytochrome P-450SU1, its N-terminal amino acid sequence, and amino acid composition, we cloned the suaC gene encoding cytochrome P-450SU1. Similar information about the cytochrome P-450SU2 protein confirmed that a gene cloned by cross-hybridization to the suaC gene was the subC gene encoding cytochrome P-450SU2. The suaC and subC genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, DNA for both genes was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with that of the well-characterized cytochrome P-450CAM from Pseudomonas putida.

      <str>The first lead polyphosphide PbP7 was synthesized from the elements in a lead flux through a low-temperature route. The PbP7 structure was determined from single crystal X-ray diffractometer data: new type, P21/c, a = 970.70(11), b = 673.34(10), c = 1243.89(18) pm, β = 122.55(1)°, wR = 0.0488, 2022 F(2) values and 74 variables. PbP7 exhibits a pronounced three-dimensional phosphorus substructure that derives from the modification of black phosphorus: rows of trans-edge-sharing P6 hexagons in chair conformation are condensed via P bridges. Two of the seven crystallographically independent phosphorus atoms have two and five of them have three P neighbours, leading to an electron-precise Zintl-like description Pb(2+)P(-)P(-)P(0)P(0)P(0)P(0)P(0). The P-P distances lie in a small range of 219 to 225 pm, indicating P-P single bond character. The lead atoms fill large cages left by the phosphide substructure. Each lead atom is coordinated to six P atoms (283-333 pm Pb-P) in the form of a half-shell (capped pentagon). The opposite side claims the space for the lead lone pair (L) leading to very long Pb-Pb distances of 473 pm between adjacent P6PbL pairs. Consistent with the crystal structure, (31)P magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra show seven distinct signal components with equal peak areas. </str>

      <str>Changes in the metabolic activity of 7-ethoxyresorufin in rat liver microsomes containing different amounts of cytochrome P-450 induced by 3-methylcholanthrene and other polycyclic hydrocarbons (P-450c) were studied. Using antibodies to cytochrome P-450c for the determination of the cytochrome P-450c content and its metabolic role, it was demonstrated that 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation by the liver microsomal monooxygenase system is catalyzed exclusively by cytochrome P-450c. The rate of the substrate metabolism is correlated with the cytochrome P-450c content in microsomal membranes; the cytochrome P-450c activity does not depend on the cytochrome P-450c/NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase ratio. The experimental results suggest that the level of 7-ethoxyresorufin metabolism in liver microsomes can be regarded as a measure of the cytochrome P-450c content, whose function is associated with the stimulation of potential carcinogenic and toxic substances.</str>

      <str>Cognitive deficit in Parkinson's disease has been traditionally considered as being mainly related to executive dysfunction secondary to frontostriatal affectation. However, this traditional consideration has recently been challenged. Forty-three nondemented PD patients (mean age = 59.19; SD = 9.64) and twenty control group subjects (mean age = 60.85; SD = 12.26) were studied. They were assessed on a wide range of cognitive functions. Patients showed motor slowing (p = .012), along with alterations in visuoperceptive (p = .001), visuospatial (p = .007) and visuoconstructive functions (p = .017), as well as in visual span (direct: p = .008; inverse: p = .037). Regarding executive functions, differences were not observed in classical measures for verbal fluency (phonetic: p = .28; semantic: p = .27) or in response inhibition (Stroop test: p = .30), while execution was altered in other prefrontal tasks (Wisconsin Test: p = .003; action fluency: p = .039). Patients showed altered performance in verbal learning processes (p = .005) and delayed memory (free: p = .032; cued: p = .006), visuospatial learning (p = .016) and linguistic functions (naming: p &lt; .001; comprehension: p = .007). Poor performance in visuospatial memory is predicted by deficits in working memory and visuospatial perception. Taken together, the observed alterations not only suggest prefrontal affectation, but also temporal and parietal systems impairment. Thus, cognitive dysfunction in nondemented PD patients cannot be exclusively explained by frontostriatal circuit affectation and the resulting executive dysfunction.</str>

      <str>A model is proposed for measuring the genetic 'distance' between two populations having gene frequencies p and p. The measure of distance is based on a hypothetical selection process as follows: From population P a subpopulation P can be selected having gene frequency p. Let Po be the largest subpopulation yielding gene frequency p, then the relative size of Po to p--denoted by thetao (p,p)--is a measure of the 'closeness' of populations having gene frequencies p and p, and 1-thetao (p,p) whould be a reasonable measure of genetic distance. We show that the calculation of thetao (p,p) is a special case of the linear programming problem and derive algebraic expressions for thetao (p,p) in the two-allele case. We discuse some of the implications of the use of this measure of distance and compare it to others which have been proposed. We use linear programming methods to calculate genetic distance for three alleles.</str>

These phenolics were detected using TLC and HPLC. The identity of p-HBA and p-HBAld was further confirmed by mass spectrometry. Various analyses showed that 10.0 mmol l(-1) concentration of p-coumaric acid produced a maximum amount of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 200 mg l(-1), into the medium at 37 degrees C with high-density cultures.</str>
      <str>A catabolic pathway of p-coumaric acid by the fungus P. variotii is suggested for the first time. During the process of p-coumaric acid degradation, p-HBA accumulated in the medium as the major degradation product.</str>
      <str>Microbial degradation of cinnamic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid has continued to be the focus of intensive study. The main goal was to identify the microbial species capable of converting these substances into commercially value-added products such as benzoic acid derivatives or aromatic aldehydes.</str>

      <str>Randomized, placebo-controlled trial. After physical examination, echocardiogram, and blood collection, cats were randomized to 1 of 3 diets, which varied in carbohydrate and fat content and ingredients. Measurements were repeated after 6 months.</str>
      <str>There were no significant differences among the 3 groups at baseline. After 6 months, there were no significant changes in the primary endpoints, left ventricular free wall (Group A, P = .760; Group B, P = .475; Group C, P = .066) or interventricular septal thickness in diastole (Group A, P = .528; Group B, P = .221; Group C, P = .097). Group A had significant increases in BUN (P = .008) and cholesterol (P = .021), while Group B had significant increases in BUN (P = .008), cholesterol (P = .007), and triglycerides (P = .005), and significant decreases in NT-proBNP (P = .013) and hs-troponin I (P = .043).

      <str>A light-weight aggregate (LWA) made of expanded clay used as a filter media in wastewater treatment, was tested for sorption of phosphorus (P) in laboratory experiments. The objectives were to investigate the different P retention pools and how grain size, time, temperature and changed P concentration influenced the P binding mechanisms in this type of filter. Three different grain sizes (0-2 mm, 2-4 mm and 0-4 mm) were tested in a batch experiment. The isotherm for the P sorbed by the contact medium (including retention and fixation) was obtained under laboratory conditions. Fifty percent of the P sorption occurred in the first 4-8 hours. Temperature did not substantially influence P sorption for 0-2 mm grain size LWA. In the LWA suspension system, P desorption did not occur when the P content in the loading solution decreased. Fractionation analysis indicated that Ca-bound P, loosely-bound P, and Al-bound P were the predominant P retention pools. The loosely-bound P pool was determined primarily by the equilibrated P concentration in the system. Fe-bound P was negligible in the P sorption of LWA.</str>

      <str>Penicillium brevicompactum and other isolates with the compact, complex conidiogenous apparatus typical of the species were sequenced in one ribosomal and two protein coding regions. The aligned DNA sequences were analyzed by maximum parsimony and the data from different loci were tested for compatibility using the partition homogeneity test. Analysis of each of the three loci revealed three clades corresponding to P. brevicompactum, P. olsonii and P. biourgeianum. Using the phylogenetic species concept and the genetic isolation of the clades, P. hagemi, P. patrismei, P. stoloniferum, and P. griseobrunneum are all synonyms of P. brevicompactum. P. volgaense is a synonym of Penicillium olsonii, while P. biourgeianum is a distinct species closely related to P. brevicompactum and P. olsonii. Phenotypic distinctions between the species are mostly based on colony characteristics such as colour. P. bialowiezenze, often treated as a synonym of P. brevicompactum, is most closely related to P. polonicum.</str>

      <str>The small GTPase Rac controls cell morphology, gene expression, and reactive oxygen species formation. Manipulations of Rac activity levels in the cerebellum result in motor coordination defects, but activators of Rac in the cerebellum are unknown. P-Rex family guanine-nucleotide exchange factors activate Rac. We show here that, whereas P-Rex1 expression within the brain is widespread, P-Rex2 is specifically expressed in the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. We have generated P-Rex2(-/-) and P-Rex1(-/-)/P-Rex2(-/-) mice, analyzed their Purkinje cell morphology, and assessed their motor functions in behavior tests. The main dendrite is thinned in Purkinje cells of P-Rex2(-/-) pups and dendrite structure appears disordered in Purkinje cells of adult P-Rex2(-/-) and P-Rex1(-/-)/P-Rex2(-/-) mice. P-Rex2(-/-) mice show a mild motor coordination defect that progressively worsens with age and is more pronounced in females than in males. P-Rex1(-/-)/P-Rex2(-/-) mice are ataxic, with reduced basic motor activity and abnormal posture and gait, as well as impaired motor coordination even at a young age. We conclude that P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 are important regulators of Purkinje cell morphology and cerebellar function.</str>

Progression in T- (p = 0.090), N- (p = 0.007) and M-categories (p = 0.001) was related to nuclear volume, while independent predictors of progression in a multivariate analysis were grade and S phase fraction. Nuclear volume predicted survival in the entire cohort (p = 0.0004) and in papillary tumours (p = 0.0048), whereas in superficial tumours it had no prognostic value. In multivariate survival analysis T-category (p &lt; 0.001), papillary status (p &lt; 0.001) and S phase fraction (p = 0.011) predicted survival and S phase fraction predicted (p = 0.052) recurrence-free survival in Ta-T1 tumours.

      <str>Three experiments were conducted to determine the effects of pelleting and extrusion of feeds on the utilization of phytate P by broilers. The first experiment investigated the effects of pelleting the whole corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet, the corn, or SBM separately on phytate P utilization. The P-deficient basal diet contained 0.5% total P and 0.2% phytate P. Steam pelleting the whole diet, the corn, or SBM separately did not decrease the severity of the P deficiency obtained and there were no indications of increased phytate P utilization. In the second experiment, the whole corn-SBM P-deficient diet was extruded. Extrusion of the diet did not influence bone ash and P rickets, both sensitive criteria of P deficiency. Extrusion decreased Ca, P, and phytate P retention and decreased the ME value of the diet. In the third experiment, phytate P retention by chickens fed three commercial pelleted diets was compared to chicks fed the corn-SBM P-deficient diet. Phytate P retention by the chickens fed the commercial diets was much lower than retention by chickens fed the corn-SBM P-deficient diet. These studies gave no indication that pelleting or extrusion of corn-SBM diets would increase phytate P utilization by broiler chickens.</str>

Pseudis tocantins chromosomes were also stained with distamycin A/DAPI. All of the species had a diploid number of 2n = 24 chromosomes and the nucleolar organizer region (NOR) was located on pair 7. However, the karyotypes could be differentiated based on the morphology of chromosomal pairs 2 and 8, the region that the NORs occupied on the long arms of the homologous of pair 7, and the pattern of heterochromatin distribution. The subspecies P. p. paradoxa and P. p. platensis had identical karyotypes. Heteromorphism in NOR size was seen in P. p. paradoxa, P. p. platensis, P. bolbodactyla and P. fusca. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW) were identified in P. tocantins. The W chromosome was subtelocentric and larger than the metacentric Z chromosomes. The differences observed in the C-banding pattern and in the position of the NOR on the sex chromosomes suggested that inversions and heterochromatinization were responsible for the morphological differentiation of these chromosomes.</str>

      <str>The readily available global rock phosphate (P) reserves may run out within the next 50-130 years, causing soils to have a reduced P concentration which will affect plant P uptake. Using a combination of mathematical modelling and experimental data, we investigated potential plant-based options for optimizing crop P uptake in reduced soil P environments. By varying the P concentration within a well-mixed agricultural soil, for high and low P (35.5-12.5 mg L(-1) respectively using Olsen's P index), we investigated branching distributions within a wheat root system that maximize P uptake. Changing the root branching distribution from linear (evenly spaced branches) to strongly exponential (a greater number of branches at the top of the soil) improves P uptake by 142% for low-P soils when root mass is kept constant between simulations. This causes the roots to emerge earlier and mimics topsoil foraging. Manipulating root branching patterns, to maximize P uptake, is not enough on its own to overcome the drop in soil P from high to low P. Further mechanisms have to be considered to fully understand the impact of P reduction on plant development. </str>

      <str>Anthropogenic activities have increased phosphorus (P) inputs to most aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, the relationship between plant nutrient resorption and P availability is still unclear, and much less is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we used a multi-level P addition experiment (0, 1.2, 4.8, and 9.6 g P m(-2) year(-1)) to assess the effect of P enrichment on nutrient resorption at plant organ, species, and community levels in a freshwater marsh of Northeast China. The response of nutrient resorption to P addition generally did not vary with addition rates. Moreover, nutrient resorption exhibited similar responses to P addition across the three hierarchical levels. Specifically, P addition decreased nitrogen (N) resorption proficiency, P resorption efficiency and proficiency, but did not impact N resorption efficiency. In addition, P resorption efficiency and proficiency were linearly related to the ratio of inorganic P to organic P and organic P fraction in mature plant organs, respectively. Our findings suggest that the allocation pattern of plant P between inorganic and organic P fractions is an underlying mechanism controlling P resorption processes, and that P enrichment could strongly influence plant-mediated biogeochemical cycles through altered nutrient resorption in the freshwater wetlands of Northeast China. </str>

      <str>In Drosophila melanogaster, hybrid dysgenesis occurs in progeny from crosses between females lacking P elements and males carrying P elements scattered throughout the genome. We have genetically isolated a naturally occurring P insertion at cytological location 1A, from a Tunisian population. The Nasr'Allah-P(1A) element [NA-P(1A)] has a deletion of the first 871 bp including the P promoter. It is flanked at the 3' end by telomeric associated sequences and at the 5' end by a HeT-A element sequence. The NA-P(1A) element strongly represses dysgenic sterility and P transposition. However, when testing P-promoter repression, NA-P(1A) was unable to repress a germinally expressed P-lacZ construct bearing no 5'-homology with it. Conversely, a second P-lacZ construct, in which the fusion with lacZ takes place in exon 3 of P, was successfully repressed by NA-P(1A). This suggests that NA-P(1A) repression involves a homology-dependent component.</str>

      <str>Temporal variations in cytochrome P-450 isozymes of rat testis, PB-P-450 (forms of cytochrome P-450 strongly induced by phenobarbital) and MC-P-448 (forms of cytochrome P-450 strongly induced by 3-methylcholanthrene), were investigated immunohistochemically by the avidin-biotin-complex method using specific antibodies against PB-P-450 and MC-P-448 isozymes. Immunoreactivity to both PB-P-450 and MC-P-448 isozymes was observed in Leydig cells. The number of PB-P-450 positive Leydig cells was found to undergo significant time-of-day variation with a peak time of 0000 hours (light phase from 0800 to 2000 hours). Injection of cadinenes (300 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally at 48 and 96 h before sacrifice) induced PB-P-450 isozyme but did not induce MC-P-448 isozyme. The induction of PB-P-450 isozyme by cadinenes was time dependent, and the early dark phase (2000 and 0000 hours) was most sensitive. These results suggest that temporal variation of cytochrome P-450 isozymes is one of the important physiological variations in detoxification and activation of various xenobiotics and chemicals in the testis.</str>

      <str>We examined the effects of Prunella vulgaris Labiatae (P. vulgaris L.) on specific and non-specific immune responses of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The optimal concentration without toxicity of P. vulgaris was determined to 30-40 μg/ml in vitro and 120 μg/100 g of fish in vivo. P. vulgaris significantly elicited an antibody titer compared to FCA or β-glucan. β-glucan plus P. vulgaris group synergistically enhanced antibody production. No significant difference in antibody production was observed between P. vulgaris and P. vulgaris plus β-glucan group. A respiratory burst activity of head kidney (HK) leucocytes of tilapia administered with 300 or 500 μg P. vulgaris was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) enhanced compared with the PBS-injected control group and FCA-treated group. Maximum increase in the NBT reduction value was observed in 500 μg P. vulgaris group but no significant difference was found between 300 and 500 μg P. vulgaris group. The level of serum lysozyme activity was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in the 300 and 500 μg P. vulgaris than 100 μg P. vulgaris and FCA group. The phagocytic activities of HK leucocytes from tilapia administered with 300 and 500 μg P. vulgaris were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than 100 μg P. vulgaris and the control group.

Thrombopoietin (TPO), soluble P-selectin, soluble P-selectin per platelet, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were evaluated in children with ITP before treatment in 16 acute and 22 chronic cases and after treatment in 10 acute and chronic cases who received mega-dose methylprednisolone. The levels of IL-6, soluble P-selectin, soluble P-selectin per platelet, and platelet count were similar in acute and chronic ITP (P &gt; 0.05) but TPO in acute ITP was higher than that of the patients with chronic ITP (P &lt; 0.05).

      <str>To understand the phosphorus (P) mobilization mechanism of Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) on a P-deficient semi-arid sandy soil of northern China, this paper compared the P fractions and acid phosphomonoesterase (AP) activity in the bulk and rhizosphere soils under different age Mongolian pine plantations. The results showed that when compared with the bulk soil, the organic C, labile organic P, and organic C/P ratio increased significantly, microbial and AP activities improved, and organic P mineralization accelerated in the rhizosphere soil. Root activity of the Mongolian pine significantly increased the bioavailability of soil P, and accelerated the shift of organic P and Ca-P to Fe-P and Al-P. The rhizosphere effects on soil P in different forms enhanced with stand age, whereas in adverse on AP activity. The bulk and rhizosphere soil had the similar trend in the dynamics of its P fractions with stand age. Soil total P pool reduced gradually while labile P pool increased with stand age. It should be essential to protect forest floor to replenish soil P pool and guarantee a long-term soil P supply.</str>

Postoperative interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 concentrations and GE in the peritoneal fluid were examined in 27 patients who underwent various types of elective abdominal surgery. We compared these results with clinical parameters of surgical stress, operating time (OT) and blood loss during the operation (BL). P-IL-6 and P-IL-8 were significantly correlated with OT (P-IL-6; r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.001: P-IL-8; r = 0.59, P &lt; 0.001) and BL (P-IL-6; r = 0.61, P &lt; 0.001: P-IL-8: r = 0.48, P &lt; 0.01).

      <str>The epidermal cell suspensions of the neonatal dorsal skin derived from wild type mouse at the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus (black, C57BL/10JHir-P/P) and their congenic mutant mouse (pink-eyed dilution, C57BL/10JHir-p/p) were cultured with a serum-free melanocyte growth medium supplemented with additional L-tyrosine (Tyr) from initiation of the primary culture. L-Tyr inhibited the proliferation of P/Pmelanocytes in a dose-dependent manner, whereas L-Tyr stimulated the proliferation of p/p melanoblasts and melanocytes regardless of dose. On the other hand, L-Tyr stimulated (P/P) or induced (p/p) the differentiation of epidermal melanocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In both P/P and p/p melanoblasts and melanocytes cultured with 2.0 mM L-Tyr for 14 days, slight increases in contents of eumelanin marker, pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) and pheomelanin marker, aminohydroxyphenylalanine (AHP) were observed. The average number of total melanosomes (stages I, II, III, and IV) per P/P melanocyte was not changed by L-Tyr treatment, but the proportion of stage IV melanosomes in the total melanosomes was increased. On the contrary, in p/p melanoblasts and melanocytes L-Tyr increased dramatically the number of stage II, III, and IV melanosomes as well as the proportion of stage III melanosomes. Contents of PTCA and eumelanin precursor, 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) of cultured media in p/p melanocytes were much more greatly increased than in P/P melanocytes. However, contents of AHP and pheomelanin precursor, 5-S-cysteinyldopa (5-S-CD) of cultured media in p/p melanocytes were increased in a similar tendency to P/Pmelanocytes. These results suggest that p/p melanocytes in the primary culture are induced to synthesize eumelanin by excess L-Tyr, but difficult to accumulate them in melanosomes.</str>

      <str>To analyze the impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy on locoregional control and overall survival in patients with carcinoma breast.</str>
      <str>Between 1995 and 2000, 688 patients of carcinoma breast were analyzed. Out of these, 608 received postmastectomy radiotherapy and 80 patients were not given any radiation therapy. At a median follow-up of 67 months, the outcomes studied were locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastases, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate analyses.</str>
      <str>The frequency of LRR with or without distant metastases was 8.5%, and distant metastases was seen in 18.7% of patients. On univariate analyses, factors affecting LRR were age &lt; 40 years (0.019), tumor stage ( P = 0.001 ), grade ( P = 0.027 ), pathological nodal status ( P ), deep resection plane (0.041), ER/PR status ( P = 0.032 ) and postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) ( P ). DFS rate was 69% at 5 years. Factors affecting distant metastases were age &lt; 40 years (0.005), tumor stage ( P ), grade ( P = 0.0007 ), pathological nodal status ( P ), extra capsular extension (ECE) ( P = 0.002 ), hormonal therapy ( P ) and PMRT ( P ). The OS rate was 81% at 5 years. Factors affecting OS were tumor stage ( P ), grade ( P = 0.0001 ), pathological nodal status ( P ), ECE ( P = 0.002 ) ER/PR status ( P = 0.008 ), hormonal therapy ( P = 0.001 ) and PMRT ( P = 0.004 ). On multivariate analysis, factors affecting LRR were age ( P = 0.001 ), tumor stage ( P = 0.021 ), deep resection plane (0.003), ECE ( P = 0.022 ) and PMRT ( P = 0.047 ). Factors affecting distant metastases were menopause ( P = 0.044 ), grade ( P = 0.012 ), ECE ( P = 0.017 ) and PMRT ( P = 0.012 ). Factors affecting OS were menopausal status ( P = 0.017 ), tumor stage ( P = 0.029 ), pathological nodal status ( P = 0.011 ) and PMRT ( P = 0.002 ).</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) in wastes from piggeries may contribute to the eutrophication of waterways if not disposed of appropriately. Phosphorus leaching, from three soils with different P sorption characteristics (two with low P retention and one with moderate P retention) when treated with piggery effluent (with or without struvite), was investigated using batch and leaching experiments. The leaching of P retained in soil from the application of struvite effluent was determined. In addition, P leaching from lime residues (resulting from the treatment of piggery effluent with lime to remove P) was determined in comparison to superphosphate when applied to the same three soils. Most P was leached from sandy soils with low P retention when effluent with or without struvite was applied. More than 100% of the filterable P applied in struvite effluent was leached in sandy soils with low P retention. Solid, inorganic forms of P (struvite) became soluble and potentially leachable at pH&lt;7 or were sorbed after dissolution if there were sufficient sorption sites. In sandy soils with low P retention, more than 39% of the total filterable P applied in recycled effluent (without struvite) was leached. Soil P increased mainly in surface layers after treatment with effluent. Sandy soils pre-treated with struvite effluent leached 40% of the P retained in the previous application. Phosphorus decreased in surface layers and increased at depth in the soil with moderate P retention after leaching the struvite effluent pre-treated soil with water. The soils capacity to adsorb P and the soil pH were the major soil properties that affected the rate and amount of P leaching, whereas the important characteristics of the effluent were pH, P concentration and the forms of P in the effluent. Phosphorus losses from soils amended with hydrated lime and lime kiln dust residues were much lower than losses from soils amended with superphosphate. Up to 92% of the P applied as superphosphate was leached from sandy soils with low P retention, whereas only up to 60% of the P applied in lime residues was leached. The P source contributing least to P leaching was the lime kiln dust residue. The amount of P leached depended on the water-soluble P content, neutralising value and application rate of the P source, and the pH and P sorption capacity of the soil.</str>

      <str>The Daliaohe river system in China has been seriously affected by long-term intensive industrial, urban and agricultural activities. The objective of this study was to determine the total phosphorus (TP) content and forms of phosphate in the sediments and investigate geochemical relationships between P forms and mineral matrix elements and P bioavailability. Four sediment profiles were taken in the Daliaohe river systems. TP content in the sediment was measured by ICP-OES and chemical forms of phosphate were measured by sequential selective extraction method. Results indicated that TP ranged from 323 to 2619 mg x kg(-1). In the sediments except 25-47 cm depth of sediment profile in the Hun river, the content of Ca bound P (Ca-P) was the highest, with more than 40% of TP. The contents of Fe bound P (Fe-P) and residual P (RES-P) were 15% to 25% of TP, while the contents of reductant soluble P (RS-P) and Al bound P (Al-P) were generally 5% to 10% of TP. However, the content of soluble and loosely bound P (S/L-P) was only less than 0.5% of TP. Huge accumulation of P in the 25-47 cm depth of the sediment profile in the Hun river led to a bigger increase in the contents of Fe-P and Al-P than Ca-P, where Al-P, Fe-P and Ca-P contents were 6.2%-23.4%, 19.6%-34.1% and 14.6%-35.6% of TP, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that sum of Fe-P and RS-P, Ca-P, and RES-P were positively correlated to Fe, Ca, and sediment organic matter (SOM) contents, respectively in the sediments except the 25-47 cm depth of sediment profile in the Hun river. In addition, TP content was positively correlated to Fe and SOM contents. The molar ratios of Fe to TP generally ranged from 20.9 to 33.9, indicating that most of sediments have capability to further retain P. Potential bioavailable P (BAP) including S/L-P, Al-P and Fe-P in the sediments was 85.43 to 1830.5 mg x kg(-1), and this part of phosphorus might pose a potential risk to the eutrophication of the Daliaohe river system and its estuary.</str>

Membranous, cytoplasmic, and/or nuclear expression of p-TrkA was seen in 54.6% of primary melanomas and 30% of metastases. Membranous p-TrkA was detected in 21.7% of primary and 14% of metastatic melanomas and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in 28.9% of primary tumors and in 22% of metastases. Significantly fewer metastases than primary tumors expressed nuclear p-TrkA (16% vs 39.5%; P = .006). A significantly higher percentage of nodular than superficial spreading melanomas expressed membranous (40% vs 11%; P &lt; .0001) p-TrkA. Nevi expressed no membranous or cytoplasmic p-TrkA; 63% showed nuclear reactivity. p-TrkA expression varied significantly with thickness of primary tumors (lower expression in thinner lesions: membranous, P = .004; cytoplasmic, P = .001; nuclear, P = .031). An association between ulceration and membranous (P = .054), cytoplasmic (P &lt; .0001), and nuclear (P = .022) p-TrkA expression was found.

      <str>Plasmodium knowlesi has entered the human population of Southeast Asia. Naturally acquired knowlesi malaria is newly described with relatively little available data, including data on the host response to infection. Therefore pre-treatment cytokine and chemokine profiles were determined for 94 P. knowlesi, and for comparison, 20, P. vivax and 22 P. falciparum, patients recruited in Malaysian Borneo. Nine, five and one patient with P. knowlesi, P. falciparum and P. vivax respectively had complicated malaria as defined by World Health Organisation. Patients with uncomplicated P. knowlesi had lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNFα than those with complicated disease (both p&lt;0.05, Dunn's post test, DPT). The anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 were detected in all patients in the study. IL-1ra, the most abundant cytokine measured, correlated with parasitaemia in P. knowlesi (r(s) = 0.47, p =  &lt;0.0001), P. vivax (r(s) = 0.61, p = 0.0042) and P. falciparum (r(s) = 0.57,p = 0.0054) malaria. IL-10 correlated with parasitaemia in both P. knowlesi (r(s) = 0.54, p =  &lt;0.0001) and P. vivax (r(s) = 0.78, p =  &lt;0.0001) infections. There were between group differences in soluble markers of macrophage activation (MIP-1β and MCP-1). P. knowlesi patients had significantly lower levels of MIP-1β than P. falciparum (DPT, p =  &lt;0.01). Uncomplicated P. knowlesi patients had significantly lower levels of MCP-1 than uncomplicated P. falciparum patients (DPT, p =  &lt;0.001). There was no significant difference between complicated and uncomplicated P. knowlesi infections. MCP-1, MIP-1β, IL-8 and TNFα increased in complicated P. knowlesi but decreased in complicated P. falciparum infections. Descriptions of human knowlesi malaria provide a comparative means to discover mediators of pathophysiology in severe P. knowlesi as well as P. falciparum malaria. Crucially, P. knowlesi may be the disease and experimental primate model for severe malaria.</str>

      <str>We retrospectively reviewed the cases of all patients who underwent pneumonectomy for malignancy at the Mayo Clinic. Between January 1, 1985, and September 30, 1998, 639 patients (469 men and 170 women) were identified. Median age was 64 years (range 20 to 86 years). Indication for pneumonectomy was primary lung cancer in 607 (95.0%) patients and metastatic disease in 32 (5.0%). Factors affecting morbidity and mortality were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.</str>
      <str>Cardiopulmonary complications occurred in 245 patients (38.3%; 95% confidence interval 34.6%-42.2%). Factors adversely affecting morbidity with univariate analysis included age (P &lt;.0001), male sex (P =.04), associated respiratory (P =.02) or cardiovascular disease (P &lt;.0001), cigarette smoking (P =.02), decreased vital capacity (P =.01), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P &lt;.0001), forced vital capacity (P =.002), diffusion capacity of the lung to carbon monoxide (P =.005), oxygen saturation (P &lt;.05), arterial PO (2) (P =.007), preoperative radiation (P =.02), bronchial stump reinforcement (P =.007), crystalloid infusion (P =.01), and blood transfusion (P =.02). Factors adversely affecting morbidity with multivariate analysis included age (P =.0001), associated cardiovascular disease (P =.001), and bronchial stump reinforcement (P =.0005). There were 45 deaths (7.0%; 95% confidence intervals 5.2%-9.3%). Factors adversely affecting mortality with univariate analysis included associated cardiovascular (P &lt;.0001) or hematologic disease (P &lt;.005), lower preoperative serum hemoglobin level (P =.004), preoperative chemotherapy (P =.01), decreased diffusion capacity of lung to carbon monoxide (P =.002), right pneumonectomy (P =.0006), extended resection (P =.04), bronchial stump reinforcement (P =.007), and crystalloid infusion (P =.01). Factors affecting mortality with multivariate analysis included hematologic disease (P =.01), lower preoperative serum hemoglobin (P =.003), and completion pneumonectomy (P =.01).</str>

      <str>By using conventional intracellular microelectrode technique to record action potentials, series antiarrhythmic drugs were used to investigate the electrophysiological features and regularities of spontaneous activity of left ventricular outflow tract.</str>
      <str>(1) Perfusion with 1 micromol/L quinidine resulted in a significant decrease in rate of pacemaker firing (RPF, P &lt; 0.05), velocity of diastolic depolarization (VDD, P &lt; 0.05), amplitude of action potential (APA, P &lt; 0.05), and maximal rate of depolarization (V(max), P &lt; 0.05), and a marked prolonging in 50% and 90% of duration of action potential (APD50 and APD90, P &lt; 0.05). (2) 1 micromol/L lidocaine decreased RPF, VDD, MDP, APA and V(max) significantly (P &lt; 0.05), shortened APD50 and APD90 notably (P &lt; 0.05). (3) 1 micromol/L propafenone led to a significant decrease in RPF (P &lt; 0.01), VDD (P &lt; 0.05), APA (P &lt; 0.05), V(max) (P &lt; 0.01), and a marked prolonging in APD50 (P &lt; 0.01) and APD90 (P &lt; 0.05). (4) Application of 5 micromol/L propranolol resulted in a significant decrease in RPF and VDD (P &lt; 0.01), MDP and APA (P &lt; 0.01), V(max) (P &lt; 0.05) and a notable prolonging in APD50 and APD90 (P &lt; 0.05). (5) Perfusion with 1 micromol/L amiodarone resulted in a significant decrease in RPF and VDD (P &lt; 0.01), APA (P &lt; 0.01), V(max) (P &lt; 0.05), a marked prolonging in APD50 (P &lt; 0.01) and APD90 (P &lt; 0.05). (6) 1 micromol/L verapamil significantly decreased RPF and VDD (P &lt; 0.01), MDP and APA (P &lt; 0.05), V(max) (P &lt; 0.05), notably prolonged APD50 and APD90 (P &lt; 0.01). (7) 50 micromol/L adenosine significantly decreased RPF and VDD (P &lt; 0.05), APA (P &lt; 0.05), V(max) (P &lt; 0.01), markedly shortened APD50 and APD90 (P &lt; 0.05).</str>
      <str>All kinds of antiarrhythmic drugs can decrease the autorhythmicity of guinea pig left ventricular outflow tract. By altering APD50 and APD90, they can affect effective refractory period (ERP) and having a significant effect on autorhythmicity of left ventricular outflow tract.</str>

      <str>The cytochrome P-450 forms involved in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation (P-450DB), phenacetin O-deethylation (P-450PA), S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (P-450MP), and nifedipine 1,4-oxidation (P-450NF) have been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver microsomes. All of these reactions show in vivo polymorphism in humans. Evidence for the roles of the purified proteins in these processes comes from in vitro reconstitution and immunoinhibition studies. The rat orthologs of these enzymes are as follows--P-450DB: P-450UT-H; P-450PA: P-450ISF-G; P-450MP: P-450UT-I; P-450NF: P-450PCN-E. Only in the case of P-450UT-H is the primary rat ortholog the same cytochrome P-450 which catalyses the catalytic reaction under consideration. Reconstitution and immunochemical studies establish that the following reactions are catalysed by the individual P-450s--P-450DB: debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation, sparteine delta 5-oxidation, bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, encainide O-demethylation, and propanolol 4-hydroxylation; P-450PA: phenacetin O-deethylation; P-450MP: S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation and tolbutamide methyl hydroxylation; P-450NF: oxidation of nifedipine and 16 other substituted dihydropyridines, estradiol 2- and 4-hydroxylation, aldrin epoxidation, benzphetamine N-demethylation and 6 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone, androstenedione and cortisol. A cDNA clone has been isolated that corresponds to rat P-450UT-H, as shown by a number of criteria. Studies with this probe establish that the sex and strain variation in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase and related activities is related to differences in the levels of a 2.0 kb length mRNA present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>p-SINE1 was the first plant SINE element identified in the Waxy gene in Oryza sativa, and since then a large number of p-SINE1-family members have been identified from rice species with the AA or non-AA genome. In this paper, we report two new rice SINE elements, designated p-SINE2 and p-SINE3, which form distinct families from that of p-SINE1. Each of the two new elements is significantly homologous to p-SINE1 in their 5'-end regions with that of the polymerase III promoter (A box and B box), but not significantly homologous in the 3'-end regions, although they all have a T-rich tail at the 3' terminus. Despite the three elements sharing minimal homology in their 3'-end regions, the deduced RNA secondary structures of p-SINE1, p-SINE2 and p-SINE3 were found to be similar to one another, such that a stem-loop structure seen in the 3'-end region of each element is well conserved, suggesting that the structure has an important role on the p-SINE retroposition. These findings suggest that the three p-SINE elements originated from a common ancestor. Similar to members of the p-SINE1 family, the members of p-SINE2 or p-SINE3 are almost randomly dispersed in each of the 12 rice chromosomes, but appear to be preferentially inserted into gene-rich regions. The p-SINE2 members were present at respective loci not only in the strains of the species with the AA genome in the O. sativa complex, but also in those of other species with the BB, CC, DD, or EE genome in the O. officinalis complex. The p-SINE3 members were, however, only present in strains of species in the O. sativa complex. These findings suggest that p-SINE2 originated in an ancestral species with the AA, BB, CC, DD and EE genomes, like p-SINE1, whereas p-SINE3 originated in an ancestral strain of the species with the AA genome. The nucleotide sequences of p-SINE1 members are more divergent than those of p-SINE2 or p-SINE3, indicating that p-SINE1 is likely to be older than p-SINE2 and p-SINE3. This suggests that p-SINE2 and p-SINE3 have been derived from p-SINE1.</str>

      <str>Pulmonary emphysema causes several electrocardiogram changes, and one of the most common and well known is on the frontal P-wave axis. P-axis verticalization (P-axis &gt; 60°) serves as a quasidiagnostic indicator of emphysema. The correlation of P-axis verticalization with the radiological severity of emphysema and severity of chronic obstructive lung function have been previously investigated and well described in the literature. However, the correlation of P-axis verticalization in emphysema with other P-indices like P-terminal force in V1 (Ptf), amplitude of initial positive component of P-waves in V1 (i-PV1), and interatrial block (IAB) have not been well studied. Our current study was undertaken to investigate the effects of emphysema on these P-wave indices in correlation with the verticalization of the P-vector.</str>
      <str>Unselected, routinely recorded electrocardiograms of 170 hospitalized emphysema patients were studied. Significant Ptf (s-Ptf) was considered ≥40 mm.ms and was divided into two types based on the morphology of P-waves in V1: either a totally negative (-) P wave in V1 or a biphasic (+/-) P wave in V1.</str>
      <str>s-Ptf correlated better with vertical P-vectors than nonvertical P-vectors (P = 0.03). s-Ptf also significantly correlated with IAB (P = 0.001); however, IAB and P-vector verticalization did not appear to have any significant correlation (P = 0.23). There was a very weak correlation between i-PV1 and frontal P-vector (r = 0.15; P = 0.047); however, no significant correlation was found between i-PV1 and P-amplitude in lead III (r = 0.07; P = 0.36).</str>
      <str>We conclude that increased P-tf in emphysema may be due to downward right atrial position caused by right atrial displacement, and thus the common assumption that increased P-tf implies left atrial enlargement should be made with caution in patients with emphysema. Also, the lack of strong correlation between i-PV1 and P-amplitude in lead III or vertical P-vector may suggest the predominant role of downward right atrial distortion rather than right atrial enlargement in causing vertical P-vector in emphysema.</str>

      <str>Phylogenetic analyses of several marker genes have previously shown that Asian primate Plasmodium species (malaria parasites) were monophyletic including Plasmodium vivax, one of the four malaria parasites that infect humans. However, except for the presence of a few established groupings, phylogenetic relationships among the Asian primate Plasmodium species + P. vivax group have neither been clearly resolved with confident statistical supports, nor the closest relative to P. vivax was elucidated. Since comparative biological studies between P. vivax and its closest relative would provide valuable information on immunopathogenesity of vivax malaria, the phylogenetic positions of P. vivax in the clade comprised of Asian primate Plasmodium species are crucial. In order to clarify the phylogeny and evolution of Asian primate Plasmodium species including P. vivax, we obtained sequences of apicoplast genome-encoded genes for small subunit rRNA (SSUrRNA), large subunit rRNA (LSUrRNA), and caseinolytic protease C (ClpC) from 10 Plasmodium species: P. vivax, P. coatneyi, P. cynomolgi, P. fieldi, P. fragile, P. hylobati, P .inui, P. knowlesi, P. simiovale, and P. gonderi. Together with published sequences of apicoplast genome-encoded elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from these species, we performed phylogenetic analyses of a combined 4-gene data set using P. gonderi, an African old world monkey parasite, as an outgroup. The ML phylogeny based on a 'concatenate model' for combining information of the 4 genes clearly revealed close relationships between P. vivax and P. cynomolgi and monophyly of P. fragile with the P. coatneyi/P. knowlesi clade. When 'separate' models were assumed for combining phylogenetic information from the 4 genes that were independently analyzed, the support for the P. vivax/P. cynomolgi clade was substantially decreased, but the monophyly of P. fragile with the P. coatneyi/P. knowlesi clade was still robustly confirmed. The present analyses place P. fragile in a position that is incongruent with the early branching status of P. fragile amongst P-vivax-related primate Plasmodium species propose by Escalante et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2005 102: 1980).</str>

      <str>1. The pressure at the surface of a segment of forearm enclosed in a plethysmograph was abruptly reduced from atmospheric to -20 to -120 mm Hg.2. Forearm circumference (equivalent to the volume of a small segment of forearm (V(f))) was measured with a strain gauge. Pressure was measured in the plethysmograph (P(p)), in veins exposed (P(ve)) and not exposed (P(vne)) to suction, in the brachial artery not exposed to suction (P(bane)) and in forearm tissue (P(t)).3. Reduction of P(p) caused increase of V(f). This was not due to gas evolution, since bubbles would not be liberated at the pressures employed. Nor was increase of V(f) due to venous backflow since P(ve) fell, but P(vne) did not, even with upper arm circulation occluded or when P(vne) was raised by venous occlusion prior to reduction of P(p).4. Reduction of P(p) temporarily arrested venous outflow since P(ve) &lt; P(vne) &lt; P(bane) for 30 sec. With reduction of P(p) 30 sec after occlusion of the upper-arm circulation, P(ve) &lt; P(vne) for &gt; 1 min, indicating that arterial inflow was then minimal.5. Increase of V(f), following reduction of P(p), was therefore due to inflow of arterial blood, of soft tissue or interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid could flow from regions external to the plethysmograph, or enter as the result of filtration across capillaries. Occlusion of the upper arm circulation was not expected to interfere with motion of forearm soft tissue or the intratissue flow of interstitial fluid. It appears that capillary filtration is small compared with observed blood flow. Therefore subtraction of V(foccl) measured at intervals after reduction of P(p) (upper arm circulation occluded) from V(f) similarly obtained (but upper arm circulation free) appeared to give change of forearm volume due to inflow of arterial blood (DeltaV(b)). V(b), the volume inflow rate of arterial blood during suction, was then obtained.6. Resting forearm flow was 1.8 ml./min/100 ml. in seven normal subjects (average mean arterial blood pressure 86 mm Hg). With P(p) = -90 mm Hg, V(b) was 10.2 ml./min/100 ml. Suction therefore reduced vascular resistance, measured as (P(bane)-P(ve)) /V(b).</str>

      <str>GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT) transfers GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P (Dol-P), forming GlcNAc-P-PDol to initiate synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol). Elevated expression of GPT in CHO-K1 cells is known to cause accumulation of the intermediate M5Gn2-P-P-Dol, presumably by excessively consuming Dol-P and thereby hindering Dol-P-dependent synthesis of Man-P-Dol (MPD) and Glc-P-Dol (GPD), which provide the residues for extending M5Gn2-P-P-Dol to G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol. If so, elevated GPT expression should increase oligosaccharide-P-P-Dol quantities and reduce monosaccharide-P-Dol quantities, while requiring GPT enzymatic activity. Here we report that elevated GPT expression failed to appreciably alter the quantities of the two classes of dolichol-linked saccharide, and that neither a GPT inhibitor nor introduction of an inactivating mutation into GPT prevented M5Gn2-P-P-Dol accumulation,arguing against excessive Dol-P consumption. Unexpectedly,we noticed similarities between the phenotypes of GPT overexpressers and of CHO-K1 cells lacking Lec35p (encoded by MPDU1, the congenital disorder of glycosylation(CDG)-If locus), which is required for utilization of MPD and GPD. By compensatory overexpression of Lec35p, G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol synthesis in GPT overexpressers could be restored. However, GPT overexpression did not affect the levels of Lec35 mRNA or protein. These results suggest that GPT may impair Lec35p function, and imply that upper as well as lower limits on GPT expression exist in normal cells. Since the mammalian GPT gene can undergo spontaneous amplification, the data also indicate a potential basis for forms of pseudo-CDG-If.</str>

      <str>Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1-12-3 generated against liver cytochrome P-450E (P-450E), an aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase of the marine fish Stenotomus chrysops (scup), reacted only with P-450E when tested in immunoblot analysis with five P-450 fractions from scup liver. This and six other MAbs against P-450E recognized purified P-450E, as well as a single band in beta-naphthoflavone (BNF)-induced scup microsomes that comigrated with authentic P-450E. Like MAb 1-12-3, polyclonal anti-P-450E reacted with P-450E but not with other scup P-450 fractions and reacted strongly with a band coincident to P-450E in BNF-treated scup microsomes. However, the polyclonal antibody (PAb) also faintly recognized additional microsomal proteins. MAb 1-12-3 recognized P-450E induced by 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl and by polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures in scup, and a single band induced by BNF or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) in microsomes of other teleosts, including two trout species, killifish and winter flounder. The content of the P-450E counterpart in these fish and also in untreated scup coincided with induced ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Induced EROD activity in scup and trout was strongly inhibited by MAb 1-12-3, further demonstrating the relationship between P-450E and induced P-450E in trout. MAb 1-12-3, two other MAbs, and anti-P-450E PAb recognized a band comigrating with P-450c in BNF-induced rat microsomes. MAb 1-12-3 also recognized purified rat P-450c. MAb 1-12-3 and anti-P-450E PAb recognized a second band of lower molecular weight than P-450c in BNF rat microsomes which may correspond to P-450d, the MC- and isosafrole-inducible rat isozyme. The results firmly establish the identity of scup P-450E, the relationship of BNF-induced P-450 in other teleosts with P-450E, and the immunochemical relationship of P-450E with rat P-450c. Furthermore, results with untreated fish suggest that effects of environmental chemicals may be detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-P-450E.</str>

      <str>There are concerns about the impact of robotic proctectomy on the quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) and the impact of laparoscopic proctectomy on the depth of the circumferential resection margin (CRM). The aim of this study was to compare the first 20 consecutive robotic proctectomies performed in our unit with matched series of open and laparoscopic proctocolectomy performed by the same surgeon.</str>
      <str>Data on the first 20 consecutive patients treated with robotic proctectomy for rectal cancer, &lt;12 cm from the anal verge, by the senior author (RB) were extracted from a prospectively maintained database. Groups of patients treated with open and laparoscopic proctectomy, matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI) with those undergoing robotic proctectomy, were selected. The quality of the TME was judged as complete, nearly complete or incomplete. CRM clearance was reported in millimetres. Physiological parameters and operative severity were assessed.</str>
      <str>Age (P = 0.619), Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Morbidity and Mortality (POSSUM) score (P = 0.657), operative severity score (P = 0.977), predicted mortality (P = 0.758), comorbidities (P = 0.427), previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.941), tumour height (P = 0.912), location (P = 0.876), stage (P = 0.984), neoadjuvant chemoradiation (P = 0.625), operating time (P = 0.066), blood loss (P = 0.356), ileostomy (P = 0.934), conversion (P = 0.362), resection type (P = 1.000), flatus (P = 0.437), diet (P = 0.439), length of hospital stay (P = 0.978), complications (P = 0.671), reoperations (P = 0.804), reinterventions (P = 0.612), readmissions (P = 0.349), tumour size (P = 0.542; P = 0.532; P = 0.238), distal margin (P = 0.790), nodes harvested (P = 0.338) and pathology stage (P = 0.623) did not differ among the three groups. The quality of TME showed a trend to be lower following robotic surgery, although this was not statistically significant [open 95/5/15 (complete/nearly complete/incompete) vs laparoscopic 95/5/15 vs robotic 80/5/15; P = 0.235], but the degree of clearance at the CRM was significantly greater in robotic patients [open 8 (0-30) mm vs laparoscopic 4 (0-30) mm vs robotic 10.5 (1-30) mm; P = 0.02].</str>

Two hundred and sixty-two consecutive patients undergoing CABG for UA/NSTEMI between January 2002 and June 2004 were prospectively divided in three groups: 126 patients underwent on-pump CABG with antegrade blood cardioplegia (Group A); 67 underwent antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia (Group B); 69 off-pump CABG (Group C). Hospital outcome was analysed. Differences in outcome variables were detected with ANOVA; Tukey's multiple comparison test and Tamhane's T2 test were used when appropriate.</str>
      <str>Group A showed higher mortality (P=.001; P=.014 vs. Group B; P=.003 vs. Group C) and perioperative myocardial infarction (P=.001; P=.016 vs. Group B; P=.05 vs. Group C). Hospital stay was shorter in Group B and Group C, compared to Group A (P=.005; P=.043 and P=.05, respectively). Group A required higher doses of inotropes compared to Group B and Group C (P=.0001; P=.0001 and P=.03, respectively), whereas Group B and Group C did not require any inotropic support at all (P=.0001; P=.002 and P=.001 vs. Group A, respectively). Total morbidity was higher in Group A (P=.006; P=.007 vs. Group B; P=.005 vs. Group C). Wall motion score index recovered only in Group B (P=.0001) and Group C (P=.001). Troponin I was higher in Group A at 12 h (P=.0001; P&lt;.001 vs. Group B and Group C), 24 (P=.0001; P=.001 vs. Group B and Group C), 48 (P=.0001; P=.001 vs. Group B, P=.002 vs. Group C) and 72 h (P=.0001; P=.004 vs. Group B; P=.05 vs. Group C).</str>

These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen. This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.</str>

      <str>The adrenalytic activity of mitotane (o,p'-DDD) has made it useful in the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma and Cushing's syndrome. In support of a study to develop mitotane analogs as more effective therapeutic agents and as a basis for understanding the toxicity of related compounds in the adrenals, the biotransformations of o,p'-DDD in adrenocortical homogenate preparations have been studied and compared with those of its m,p'- and p,p'-isomers. Aliphatic oxidation to the corresponding acetic acid derivative, o,p'-, m,p'- or p,p'-DDA, was the major transformation for all the preparations. In the comparisons of the DDD isomers, the order of both DDA formation and apparent covalent binding was o,p'- &gt; m,p'- &gt; p,p'-DDD. There was also evidence for alpha-hydroxylation at the benzylic carbon with subsequent loss of water to form ethylene derivatives. This was a minor pathway for o,p'-DDD, but was the major pathway for the other two isomers. Thus, while the total yields of metabolites of o,p'- and m,p'-DDD were similar and at least twice that of the p,p'-isomer, their distribution of metabolites differed significantly. The effects of the three isomers on cell growth and cortisol production with the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, NCI H-295, followed the same order as their DDA formation and tissue binding. It is proposed that hydroxylation by the adrenal cortex at the beta-carbon leads to an adrenalytic effect, whereas hydroxylation at the alpha-carbon would represent an alternate deactivation pathway.</str>

      <str>Pollution of fresh waters by agricultural phosphorus (P) is a water quality concern. Because soils can contribute significantly to P loss in runoff, it is important to assess how management affects soil P status over time, which is often done with models. Our objective was to describe and validate soil P dynamics in the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model. APLE is a user-friendly spreadsheet model that simulates P loss in runoff and soil P dynamics over 10 yr for a given set of runoff, erosion, and management conditions. For soil P dynamics, APLE simulates two layers in the topsoil, each with three inorganic P pools and one organic P pool. It simulates P additions to soil from manure and fertilizer, distribution among pools, mixing between layers due to tillage and bioturbation, leaching between and out of layers, crop P removal, and loss by surface runoff and erosion. We used soil P data from 25 published studies to validate APLE's soil P processes. Our results show that APLE reliably simulated soil P dynamics for a wide range of soil properties, soil depths, P application sources and rates, durations, soil P contents, and management practices. We validated APLE specifically for situations where soil P was increasing from excessive P inputs, where soil P was decreasing due to greater outputs than inputs, and where soil P stratification occurred in no-till and pasture soils. Successful simulations demonstrate APLE's potential to be applied to major management scenarios related to soil P loss in runoff and erosion.</str>

      <str>Decreasing the potential delivery of phosphorus in fertilizers or animal waste to surface and groundwater requires a knowledge of phosphorus's fate and transport mechanisms. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service has recently mandated each state to develop an assessment tool to estimate P transport to water bodies. The objective of this paper is to describe the processes involved with P transport to surface and groundwaters that must be accounted for in practical methods used to quantify the potential for P loss. Mechanistic models to assess P loss should account for: 1) P adsorbed to eroding sediments, 2) soluble P in runoff water, 3) soluble P in leaching water, and 4) P losses related to specific P sources. With sediment-bound P, the adsorbed P content in the eroded soil mass at the field edge must be quantified, whereas runoff volume and P concentration are needed to estimate soluble P loss in runoff water. Estimating P leaching potential requires calculation of drainage water volume and P concentration. When P is applied in animal waste, the specific source influences both soluble and particulate P loss because of differences in P solubility between waste types. In addition, the effects of conservation practices and other technologies on decreasing sediment, soluble, and leached P need to be included. Using these methods, a practical, quantitative P loss assessment tool can be developed that will enable technical service providers and other practitioners to estimate potential P loss and design best-management practices for land-applied waste management systems in order to minimize P transport to surface and groundwater.</str>

      <str>After its recent introduction to Chile, the aphid Chaitophorus leucomelas Koch is becoming a serious pest affecting commercial poplar, Populus spp., plantations. The pattern of natural infestation of C. leucomelas among poplar hybrids with different pedigrees and the aphid intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), of C. leucomelas were assessed in the field. In most of the hybrids, aphid abundance peaked in March (late summer). Among 12 types of poplar crosses, [(P. trichocarpa Torr. &amp; Gray x P. deltoides Bartram ex Marshall) x (P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides)] and [(P. trichocarpa x P. maximowiczii Henry) x P. maximowiczii] showed the highest and lowest aphid densities, respectively. A trend to find more aphids in branch bases was apparent. The intrinsic rate of C. leucomelas increase was higher in [(P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides) x P. deltoides] hybrids, and lower in [(P. trichocarpa x P. maximowiczii) x P. trichocarpa] hybrids. Aphid density and performance were higher in hybrids with P. deltoides parentage, whereas hybrids with P. maximowiczii parentage showed lower aphid densities and performance. Hybrids with P. nigra L. parentage, namely, [P. trichocarpa x P. nigra], also had high aphid density, but aphid performance was lower compared with hybrids with P. deltoides parentage. These results suggest that among poplar hybrids studied, susceptibility to C. leucomelas is inherited through P. deltoides, whereas resistance seems to be inherited through P. maximowiczii. Thus, P. maximowiczii hybrids are recommended for commercial or ornamental planting programs in zones where there is a high risk of aphid infestation.</str>

      <str>The P risk index system has been developed to identify agricultural fields vulnerable to P loss as a step toward protecting surface water. Because of their high Langmuir phosphorus adsorption maxima (P(max)), use of drinking water treatment residuals (WTRs) should be considered as a best management practice (BMP) to lower P risk index scores. This work discusses three WTR application methods that can be used to reduce P risk scores: (i) enhanced buffer strip, (ii) incorporation into a high soil test phosphorus (STP) soil, and (iii) co-blending with manure or biosolids. The relationship between WTR P(max) and reduction in P extractability and runoff P was investigated. In a simulated rainfall experiment, using a buffer strip enhanced with 20 Mg WTR ha(-1), runoff P was reduced by from 66.8 to 86.2% and reductions were related to the WTR P(max). When 25 g kg(-1) WTR was incorporated into a high STP soil of 315 mg kg(-1) determined using Mehlich-3 extraction, 0.01 M calcium chloride-extractable phosphorus (CaCl(2)-P) reductions ranged from 60.9 to 96.0% and were strongly (P &lt; 0.01) related to WTR P(max). At a 100 g kg(-1) WTR addition, Mehlich 3-extractable P reductions ranged from 41.1 to 86.7% and were strongly (P &lt; 0.01) related to WTR P(max). Co-blending WTR at 250 g kg(-1) to manure or biosolids reduced CaCl(2)-P by &gt;75%. The WTR P(max) normalized across WTR application rates (P(max) x WTR application) was significantly related to reductions in CaCl(2)-P or STP. Using WTR as a P risk index modifying factor will promote effective use of WTR as a BMP to reduce P loss from agricultural land.</str>

      <str>Although no information exists regarding the levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) on reproductive fluids of heavily exposed populations, they are possibly quite high given the serum levels reported so far. In these populations altered semen quality has been reported, although the direct effects of this DDT metabolite on crucial sperm parameters remain largely unexplored. With this in mind, a long-term in vitro incubation that better mimics the putative continuous exposure of spermatozoa to p,p'-DDE in the female reproductive tract in vivo was used. Before compromising sperm viability, continuous p,p'-DDE exposure remarkably decreased sperm motility, possibly due to the combined reduction in the proportion of sperm with high mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels, all of which were clearly more affected at 50 and 100 μM p,p'-DDE. Moreover, 25 μM p,p'-DDE was also able to promote a decline in sperm with high MMP, however without significantly affecting motility. On the other hand, p,p'-DDE at the highest concentration strongly inhibited the process of capacitation following 24h of incubation. In conclusion, human sperm function is affected by continuous high p,p'-DDE exposure which may ultimately compromise male fertility. Given our previously findings that showed a non-regulated Ca(2+) entry in the presence of p,p'-DDE, we suggest that this organochlorine may promote mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload which may culminate in a general mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular ATP depletion, thus affecting sperm fertilizing potential. Our findings suggest a broader understanding of the non-genomic mechanism of p,p'-DDE action in human sperm.</str>

      <str>Nine distinct monoclonal antibodies raised against purified rat liver cytochrome P-450c react with six different epitopes on the antigen, and one of these epitopes is shared by cytochrome P-450d. None of these monoclonal antibodies recognize seven other purified rat liver isozymes (cytochromes P-450a, b, and e-i) or other proteins in the cytochrome P-450 region of "Western blots" of liver microsomes. Each of the monoclonal antibodies was used to probe "Western blots" of liver microsomes from untreated, or 3-methylcholanthrene-, or isosafrole-treated animals to determine if laboratory animals other than rats possess isozymes immunochemically related to cytochromes P-450c and P-450d. Two protein-staining bands immunorelated to cytochromes P-450c and P-450d were observed in all animals treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (rabbit, hamster, guinea pig, and C57BL/6J mouse) except the DBA/2J mouse, where no polypeptide immunorelated to cytochrome P-450c was detected. The conservation of the number of rat cytochrome P-450c epitopes among these species varied from as few as two (guinea pig) to as many as five epitopes (C57BL/6J mouse and rabbit). The relative mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels of polypeptides immunorelated to cytochromes P-450c and P-450d was similar in all species examined except the guinea pig, where the polypeptide related to cytochrome P-450c had a smaller Mr than cytochrome P-450d. With the use of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, we were able to establish that purified rabbit cytochromes P-450 LM4 and P-450 LM6 are immunorelated to rat cytochromes P-450d and P-450c, respectively.</str>

Thus, anti-Poa p I MAbs 60 and 61 and anti-Lol p I MAb 290A-167 recognized Poa p Ia and Poa p Ib whereas anti-Poa p I MAbs 62, 63 and 64 and anti-Lol p I MAb 348A-6 recognized only Poa p Ia. The specificities of the MAbs were further resolved by comparing their respective abilities to inhibit the binding of 125I-Poa p I or 125I-Lol p I to the different MAbs prepared in the form of solid phase. These studies revealed that at least 4 distinct epitopes (designated as E1, E2, E3 and E4) were shared by both Poa p I and Lol p I. All 4 epitopes were present on Poa p Ia whereas only E1 and E3 were detected on Poa p Ib.

F+P+ and F-P+ bacteria efficiently adhered to mouse epidermal cells, while F+P- and F-P- bacteria hardly adhered to mouse epidermal cells. The number of F+P+ bacteria that adhered to mouse epidermal cells was almost the same as that of F-P+ bacteria. The number of F+P- bacteria that adhered to mouse epidermal cells was almost the same as that of F-P- bacteria. The adhesion of P+ (F+P+ and F-P+) bacteria was inhibited by antipilus serum, while that of P- (F+P- and F-P-) bacteria was not inhibited by antipilus serum. There were no significant differences between the number of bacteria adhering to mouse epidermal cells isolated from normal skin and those adhering to cells isolated from burned skin. Heating of the mouse epidermal cell suspension had no effect on the adhesion of P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that pili mediate the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to mouse epidermal cells and that P. aeruginosa adheres efficiently to mouse epidermal cells despite the loss of cell viability caused by burning.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) is an important macronutrient in arctic and subarctic tundra and its bioavailability is regulated by the mineralization of organic P. Temperature is likely to be an important control on P bioavailability, although effects may differ across contrasting plant communities with different soil properties. We used an elevational gradient in northern Sweden that included both heath and meadow vegetation types at all elevations to study the effects of temperature, soil P sorption capacity and oxalate-extractable aluminium (Alox) and iron (Feox) on the concentration of different soil P fractions. We hypothesized that the concentration of labile P fractions would decrease with increasing elevation (and thus declining temperature), but would be lower in meadow than in heath, given that N to P ratios in meadow foliage are higher. As expected, labile P in the form of Resin-P declined sharply with elevation for both vegetation types. Meadow soils did not have lower concentrations of Resin-P than heath soils, but they did have 2-fold and 1.5-fold higher concentrations of NaOH-extractable organic P and Residual P, respectively. Further, meadow soils had 3-fold higher concentrations of Alox + Feox and a 20% higher P sorption index than did heath soils. Additionally, Resin-P expressed as a proportion of total soil P for the meadow was on average half that in the heath. Declining Resin-P concentrations with elevation were best explained by an associated 2.5-3.0 °C decline in temperature. In contrast, the lower P availability in meadow relative to heath soils may be associated with impaired organic P mineralization, as indicated by a higher accumulation of organic P and P sorption capacity. Our results indicate that predicted temperature increases in the arctic over the next century may influence P availability and biogeochemistry, with consequences for key ecosystem processes limited by P, such as primary productivity.</str>

      <str>Organochlorine pesticide p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is still used for vector control in several tropical and subtropical areas of South America and there is evidence of recent illegal use in agriculture. Its main breakdown product in the environment and living organisms is p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), which is considered a marker of past exposure to DDT. The aim of the present study was to assess human exposure to p,p'-DDE in a sample of agricultural farmers from three rural communities in eastern Bolivia. In addition, o,p'-DDT was analyzed as a surrogate of a potential ongoing exposure to the pesticide. Face-to-face questionnaires were performed, and serum samples were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. p,p'-DDE was found in 100% of the samples, with a median concentration of 19.7ngmL(-1) (4788.7ng/g lipid), while o,p'-DDT was detected in 3 samples (4.3%). Serum p,p'-DDE concentrations were associated with time of residence in the study area, personal hygiene after work, and body mass index in adjusted multinomial logistic regression models with tertiles of p,p'-DDE as the dependent variable. The present results revealed high levels of exposure to p,p'-DDE, which might be derived from a heavily polluted local environment and past occupational exposure.

      <str>The appearance of perivenular fibrosis on liver biopsy reflects the beginning of the fibrotic process that ultimately results in liver cirrhosis. To examine whether the fibrogenic activity can be detected by blood tests, we evaluated whole antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) of procollagen type III N-terminal peptides (P-III-P), RIA of these peptides using Fab fragments (Fab-P-III-P), and RIA of the laminin P1 peptide in alcoholics within 1 week of alcohol abstinence. The Fab-P-III-P levels in subjects with perivenular fibrosis were significantly higher than those in patients with simple fatty liver. Values in 63% of subjects with perivenular fibrosis exceeded the upper limit of the fatty liver group. Patients with simple fatty liver had significantly lower values than nonalcoholic controls. Serum levels of P-III-P and laminin were elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and correlated well with the degree of inflammation. With abstinence, Fab-P-III-P levels increased in all alcoholics. P-III-P values increased in patients with normal P-III-P values on admission. By contrast, the values of laminin decreased during abstinence. Therefore, to interpret serum levels of Fab-P-III-P, P-III-P, and laminin, the duration of abstinence must be taken into consideration. P-III-P, Fab-P-III-P and laminin measurements in the serum within 1 week of abstinence can contribute to the detection of alcoholic liver disease and the determination of its stage.</str>

      <str>Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been demonstrated to be alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Unfortunately, the wide use of UCB Transplantation is limited due to the low number of HSCs. The aim of this study was to determine factors that affect the number of HSCs collected from UCB. 200 eligible donors were included for HSCs testing, including total nucleated cells (TNCs) and CD34+ cell number, by using univariate and multivariate analysis. In univariate analysis, factors positively associated with higher number of TNCs were maternal weight (P=0.002), preeclampsia (P=0.03), neonatal weight (P&lt;0.001), neonatal platelet count (P=0.02), neonatal Rh (P=0.03), gestational age (P=0.04) and delivery type (P&lt;0.001). Factors positively associated with higher number of CD34+ cells were maternal weight (P&lt;0.007), preeclampsia (P=0.02), maternal hypertension (P=0.02) neonatal weight (P&lt;0.001), neonatal Rh type (P=0.02) and delivery type (P=0.04). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly influence TNCs were neonatal weight (P&lt;0.001), preeclampsia (P=0.008), neonatal Rh type (P=0.02) and delivery type (P&lt;0.001). While factors significantly influence number of CD34+ cells were maternal weight (P=0.025), neonatal weight (P=0.005), neonatal Rh (P=0.006), nuchal cord (P=0.026) and delivery type (P=0.009). Conclusions factors significantly influence TNCs content of UCB were neonatal weight, preeclampsia, neonatal Rh and delivery type. While factors significantly influence number of CD34+ cells were maternal weight, neonatal weight, neonatal Rh, nuchal cord and delivery type.</str>

      <str>Bioaccumulation and metabolism of p,p'-DDT was studied in the marine carnivorous fish Lates calcarifer, Asian seabass, in a controlled aquaculture experiment. Over a 42-d period, seabass were fed pellets dosed with p,p'-DDT at environmentally realistic levels. Virtually all p,p'-DDT in pellets bioaccumulated in the fish with an uptake efficiency of 98%. The levels of p,p'-DDT and the metabolites p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE were analyzed in muscle, liver, visceral fat, brain, and remaining tissues. Partitioning of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites among the control, low-dose, and high-dose exposed seabass were 14.8% in muscle, 3.5% in liver, 37.1% in visceral fat, 0.11% in brain, and 45.5% in remaining tissues, where partitioning between tissues was a function of tissue lipid content. p,p'-DDT bioaccumulation increased linearly with exposure in visceral fat and muscle tissue. The metabolism of p,p'-DDT, which occurs mainly in the liver, resulted in the degradation of 2.5% of p,p'-DDT into p,p'-DDD. These new findings show that bioaccumulation processes at environmentally realistic ingestion exposure levels (ng/g) differ from previous DDT ingestion studies conducted at unrealistically high DDT levels (microg/g), highlighting the need to revise models on the transfer of persistent organic pollutants in the marine environment and aquaculture systems.</str>

      <str>The mutagenic activation of various promutagens by liver microsomes from dogs, monkeys and humans was investigated. Dog liver microsomes efficiently catalyzed the mutagenic activation of Trp-P-2 and Glu-P-1 followed by IQ and AAF. Monkey liver microsomes were most active in the activation of IQ followed by Glu-P-1, AAF and Trp-P-2. Although there were remarkable individual differences, human liver microsomes were found to be most active in the mutagenic activation of IQ followed by Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1 and AAF. Antibodies against rat P-448-H inhibited the mutagenic activation of Glu-P-1, Trp-P-2 and IQ in rat and dog liver microsomes, and Glu-P-1 and Trp-P-2 in monkey liver microsomes. The activation of Glu-P-1 and IQ in human liver microsomes was also strongly inhibited by anti-P-448-H antibodies. The amounts of cytochrome P-450 cross-reactive with anti-P-448-H antibodies in human liver microsomes highly correlated with the capacity to activate Glu-P-1, Trp-P-2 and IQ but not AAF.</str>

      <str>Patagifer Dietz, 1909 is revised and a key to the species is presented. P. oweni n. sp. is described from Threskiornis molucca (Cuvier) in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea and distinguished from the related P. chandrapuri Srivastava, 1952 by: the shape of the pair of large angle spines (cudgel-shaped vs sub-rectangular); pointed (vs rod-shaped) marginal spines; a smaller body and internal organs; more anteriorly located testes; and larger eggs. The new species differs from P. brygooi Richard, 1964 in its larger body, head collar, suckers, pharynx and eggs, longer oesophagus and testes, the latter being also more elongate and more anteriorly located, and a different number of collar spines (61-62 vs 59). P. bilobus (Rudolphi, 1819) (the type-species), P. parvispinosus Yamaguti, 1933, P. chandrapuri and P. vioscai Lumsden, 1962 are redescribed on the basis of museum and newly collected material. The variations in the number and size of the collar spines and other metrical characters of P. bilobus are studied in two different host species from Europe, Plegadis falcinellus and Platalea leucorodia. Other species considered valid are: Patagifer consimilis Dietz, 1909, P. acuminatus Johnston, 1917, P. fraternus Johnston, 1917, P. wesleyi Verma, 1936, P. brygooi and P. toki Onda, Imai &amp; Ishii, 1983. P. plegadisi Sakla, Monib &amp; Mandour, 1988 and P. simarai Nigam, 1944 are considered synonyms of P. bilobus, and P. sarai Saksena, 1957 is placed in synonymy with P. chandrapuri.

Analyses were performed by high-resolution gas chromatography. p,p'-DDT was found to be accumulated in a dose-dependent manner with the highest concentration in adipose tissue. However, in brain, the accumulation of pesticide was low and remained unchanged at the higher dose. This difference may relate to the protective role of the blood-brain barrier, which limits the access of the xenobiotic in the cerebral compartment, and to the differential tissue lipid composition. Although tissues concentration of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD correlated positively to total p,p'-DDT levels, the active role in detoxification of pollutants may explain why p,p'-DDD is more abundant in liver than in the rest of organs. On the contrary, in brain, the concentration of p,p'-DDE is higher than that of p,p'-DDD, suggesting that the metabolism of the parent insecticide proceeds via more than one pathway.</str>

      <str>1-Phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P), also known as benzyl methyl ketone (BMK), is the main precursor used in amphetamine synthesis. In recent years, the number of seizures of P-2-P from both licit and illicit drug manufacture has increased. The present article comprises a discussion of some of the largest seizures of P-2-P diverted from regular production to the illicit market. It also presents the methods used in clandestine laboratories to synthesize P-2-P and a forensic approach to identify and differentiate between these methods. To that end, and to facilitate the monitoring of the P-2-P market, a method of P-2-P impurity profiling was designed for comparative purposes and for the identification of the synthesis route. P-2-P samples were analysed by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Out of 36 identified impurities, 14 were selected as markers for sample comparison. On the basis of the GC peak areas of those 14 markers, a cluster analysis was carried out, resulting in three clusters, each corresponding to a given P-2-P synthesis route. The results of P-2-P impurity profiling are stored in both a forensic database and a police database. The forensic database comprises chemical data, such as those on P-2-P purity, additives and specific impurities, as well as information on seized P-2-P samples having a similar impurity profile. Data stored in the police database, which is linked with the forensic database by case identification number, cover the circumstances of seizures and personal details of offenders. The databases enable the full use of forensic data in intelligence work and police investigative activities.</str>

      <str>Few reports have so far investigated the relationship between fibrinogen levels and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) as evaluated by coronary angiography, that is therefore the aim of the current study. We measured fibrinogen in 2,121 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography. Patients were divided in 5 groups based on quintiles of fibrinogen levels. Significant CAD was defined as stenosis &gt;50% in at least 1 coronary vessel. We additionally measured carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in a subgroup of 359 patients. Patients with elevated fibrinogen were older (P = 0.038), with larger prevalence of diabetes (P = 0.027), female gender (P &lt; 0.0001), hypertension (P &lt; 0.001), chronic renal failure (P &lt; 0.0001), previous CVA (P = 0.036), less often with family history of CAD (P = 0.019) and previous PCI (P &lt; 0.0001), more often presenting with ACS (P &lt; 0.0001), more often on nitrates (P &lt; 0.0001), clopidogrel (P = 0.009) and diuretics (P &lt; 0.0001). Fibrinogen levels were linearly associated with baseline glycaemia (P &lt; 0.017), WBC count (P &lt; 0.0001), creatinine (P &lt; 0.0001), and Platelet count (P &lt; 0.0001) but inversely associated with RBC count (P &lt; 0.0001). Fibrinogen levels were associated with CAD (P = 0.001), especially for extremely high levels (5th percentile, P &lt; 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, after correction for baseline confounding factors, high fibrinogen level (5th percentile) was still associated with the prevalence of CAD (P = 0.034). Furthermore, fibrinogen levels were related with maximal CIMT (r = 0.12; P = 0.01), with larger prevalence of carotid plaques in patients with higher fibrinogen levels (5th quintile) as compared to remaining patients (P = 0.046). This study showed that high fibrinogen level is significantly associated with CAD and carotid atherosclerosis.</str>

      <str>Land application of wastewater presents potential for ground water pollution if not properly managed. In situ breakthrough tests were conducted using potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)-processing wastewater and a Br tracer to characterize P leaching in seasonally frozen sandy outwash soils. In the first test, P and Br breakthrough were measured in a 7-m deep well following wastewater [2.94 mg L(-1) total P (TP); 280 mg L(-1) Br] application at the site that had 13.1 mg water-extractable P (WEP) kg(-1)and 94.4 mg Bray-1 P kg(-1). Bromide was detected in the well after approximately 0.4 pore volumes, but there was no P break-through after 7 pore volumes. In the second breakthrough test, wastewater containing 3.6 mg L(-1) TP and 259 mg L(-1) Br was applied on 1.5-m deep lysimeters at low (0.8 mg WEP kg(-1); 12.1 mg Bray-1 P kg(-1)) and high soil test P sites (104 mg WEP kg(-1); 585 mg Bray-1 P kg(-1)). Leachate TP concentration during the test remained constant (0.04 mg L(-1)) at the low P sites but increased from approximately 3.5 to 5.6 mg L(-1) at the high P sites. These results indicate no P leaching in low P soils, but leaching in high P soils, thus suggesting that most of the P leached at the high P sites was mainly due to desorption and dissolution of weakly adsorbed P from prior P applications. This was consistent with P transport simulations using the convective-dispersive equation. We conclude that P concentration in land-applied wastewater should be regulated based on soil test-P level plus wastewater P loading.</str>

Organochlorines of the dichlorodiphenylethane class (i.e., p,p'-dichlorodiphenylethane and p,p'-dichlorodiphenylethane) were found in all samples and at the highest mean concentrations observed in the study. Chemicals in the hexachlorocyclohexane family (i.e., alpha- and delta-hexachlocyclohexane) were not found at all (0%), and the other hexachlorocyclohexane compounds (i.e., beta &gt; gamma) were found in less than 6% of the samples.

      <str>Sow and piglet variables related to probability of stillbirth and to viability score were analyzed in litters from 98 multiparous Yorkshire sows. Immediately after the birth of each piglet, viability was scored using Randall's method. Sow variables related to the probability of stillbirth were average birth weight of the litter (p = 0.0001), sow age (p = 0.001), sow condition score (p = 0.003), length of gestation (p = 0.005), and number of piglets in the litter (p = 0.01). Sow variables related to average viability score were average birth weight of the litter (p = 0.001), standard deviation in birth weight in the litter (p = 0.02), sow age (p = 0.03), sow condition score (p = 0.03), and length of gestation (p = 0.03). Piglet variables related to probability of stillbirth were piglet hemoglobin (p = 0.0001), position in the birth order (p = 0.0001), broken umbilical cord (p = 0.0004), and preceding birth interval (p = 0.0004). Piglet variables related to viability score were piglet hemoglobin (p = 0.0001), position in the birth order (p = 0.0001), broken umbilical cord (p = 0.0001), preceding birth interval (p = 0.0001), and birth weight (p = 0.004). Preceding birth interval was related to whether the piglet was live or stillborn (p = 0.0001), to position in the birth order (p = 0.003), and to the sex of the piglet (p = 0.03).The results demonstrated that sow and piglet variables were highly correlated to probability of stillbirth and to viability score. In addition it was also found that the probability of stillbirth was not associated with the duration of farrowing but with the number of piglets in the litter and piglet hemoglobin level. This study also found that lower weight piglets tend to have poor viability, but are not more prone to stillbirth as commonly suggested. These low viability piglets may survive if the necessary care is given during the farrowing process.</str>

      <str>1. The focus of this review is the effects and mechanism of action of p,p'-DDE on eggshell formation in birds. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the eggshell gland mucosa is a probable mechanism for p,p'-DDE-induced eggshell thinning. 2. The duck is sensitive to p,p'-DDE-induced eggshell thinning but the domestic fowl is not, and studies comparing the two species in regard to the calcium and prostaglandin metabolism of the eggshell gland have shown that eggshell thinning induced by p,p'-DDE in ducks is accompanied by reduced activity of prostaglandin synthetase, reduced levels of prostaglandin E2, and reduced uptake of 45Ca by the eggshell gland mucosa. The content of calcium, bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, and potassium are also reduced in the eggshell gland lumen in ducks exhibiting eggshell thinning. None of these effects are seen in the domestic fowl. 3. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is a specific effect of p,p'-DDE. The detrimental effects of p,p'-DDE on the eggshell gland seem to be unique when comparing the compound with structurally related substances, i.e., similar treatment regimens with o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD do not cause eggshell thinning in ducks. Neither do they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the eggshell gland mucosa. 4. Administration of other compounds that do inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, e.g., indomethacin, does cause the same effects as those seen with p,p'-DDE, i.e., eggshell thinning and the described effects on the calcium and prostaglandin metabolism of the eggshell gland.</str>

      <str>Fertilization exceeding crop requirements causes an accumulation of phosphorus (P) in soils, which might increase concentrations of dissolved and colloidal P in drainage. We sampled soils classified as Typic Haplorthods from four fertilization experiments to test (i) whether increasing degrees of phosphorus saturation (DPS) increase concentrations of dissolved and colloidal P, and (ii) if critical DPS levels can be defined for P release from these soils. Oxalate-extractable concentrations of P, iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) were quantified to characterize DPS. Turbidity, zeta potential, dissolved P, and colloidal P, Fe, Al, and carbon (C) concentrations were determined in water and KCl extracts. While concentrations of dissolved P decreased with increasing depth, concentrations of water-extractable colloidal P remained constant. In topsoils 28 +/- 17% and in subsoils 94 +/- 8% of water-extractable P was bound to colloids. Concentrations of dissolved P increased sharply for DPS &gt; 0.1. Colloidal P concentrations increased with increasing DPS because of an additional mobilization of colloids and due to an increase of the colloids P contents. In addition to DPS, ionic strength and Ca(2+) affected the release of colloidal P. Hence, using KCl for extraction improved the relationship between DPS and colloidal P compared with water extraction. Accumulation of P in soils increases not only concentrations of dissolved P but also the risk of colloidal P mobilization. Leaching of colloidal P is potentially important for inputs of P into water bodies because colloidal P as the dominant water-extractable P fraction in subsoils was released from soils with relatively low DPS.</str>

      <str>The effects of cyclic AMP (cAMP) on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P(2)) synthesis were examined in human platelets. In (32)P-prelabeled intact platelets, although the level of [(32)P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI 4-P) was increased by forskolin and prostaglandin-I(2) (PGI(2)), the formation of [(32)P]PI 4,5-P(2) time-and concentration-dependently decreased, suggesting inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI 4-P 5-kinase). In saponin-permeabilized platelets, formation of PI 4-P and PI 4,5-P(2) can be measured by utilizing [γ-(32)P] ATP. In this system, PGI(2) and cAMP inhibited the generation of [(32)P)PI 4,5-P(2). The PI 4-P 5-kinase activity was mostly located in the platelet membrane fraction and was inhibited by cAMP; H-8 and H-89, inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), abolished this inhibitory effect, suggesting that cAMP exerted its action on PI 4-P 5-kinase via PKA. Adenosine, which is reported to directly inhibit phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase) in some types of cells, had no effect on platelet membrane PI 4-P 5-kinase activity. In dbc AMP-pretreated membranes, PI 4-P 5-kinase activity was lower than that of control membranes. The involvement of PKA with the inhibitory action of cAMP in PI 4-P 5-kinase activity was further confirmed using the catalytic subunit of PKA. The synthesis of [(32)P] PI 4,5-P(2) in permeabilized platelets and the specific activity of partially purified PI 4-P 5-kinase were decreased by incubation with the PKA catalytic subunit. The present results indicate that the cAMP-PKA system inhibits PI 4-P 5-kinase activity, leading to decreased formation of PI 4,5-P(2) in human platelets.</str>

      <str>We have immunohistochemically investigated P-cadherin (P-CD) expression in a series of 210 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC) in an attempt to assess the biological and prognostic relevance of P-CD in patients harboring IDCs. Although only 74/210 (35%) of IDCs expressed P-CD in &gt;5% of tumor cells (P-CD-positive carcinomas), categorical analyses revealed that P-CD-positive IDCs were larger (26 +/- 21 cm versus 22 +/- 11 cm, P =.0568), of higher histological grade (P =.0001), and had more lymph node metastases (P =.0327) than P-CD-negative breast carcinomas. In addition, P-CD-positive tumors were negative for estrogen (P =.0001) and progesterone receptors (P =.0001) and showed reduced E-cadherin expression (P =.0276) more frequently than P-CD-negative tumors. Univariate analysis carried out in 171 patients demonstrated that P-CD expression was also an indicator of poor prognosis (chi(2) = 8.292, P =.004), extent of lymph node metastasis (chi(2) = 20.854, P =.0000), histological grade (chi(2) = 12.908, P =.0016), and negative progesterone receptors (chi(2) = 4.116, P =.042). However, only histological grade and nodal metastases emerged as independent prognostic markers in the multivariate analysis. These results suggest that although P-CD expression may be involved in the progression of IDCs, its value as an independent prognostic factor remains to be established.</str>

      <str>Strong a-catenin expression was related to low Gleason grade (p &lt; 0.001), cancer-free seminal vesicles (p = 0.04) and low preoperative PSA (p = 0.02). Strong beta-catenin expression was related to low Gleason grade (p &lt; 0.001) and cancer-free seminal vesicle status (p = 0.03). Absence of nuclear beta-catenin expression was related to local disease (pT1-T2) (p = 0.05). alpha-catenin (p = 0.06), beta-catenin (p = 0.05), Gleason grade (p = 0.03) and capsular invasion (p = 0.01) were related to PSA recurrence in patients who reached PSA zero postoperatively. PSA recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly related to Gleason grade (p &lt; 0.001), capsule invasion (p = 0.01), perineural growth (p = 0.05) and preoperative PSA (p = 0.05). In Cox's analysis, independent predictors of PSA RFS were Gleason grade (p &lt; 0.001) and capsular invasion (p = 0.006). Low expressions of alpha- (p = 0.06) and beta-catenin (p = 0.05) were related to shortened PSA RFS. Survival was related to low alpha- (p = 0.011) and beta-catenin (p = 0.016) expressions. Independent predictors of shortened survival were seminal vesicle invasion (p = 0.016) and low alpha-catenin expression (p = 0.049).</str>

      <str>The kinetics of the P+HA- (oxidized donor, reduced bacteriopheophytin acceptor) recombination reaction was measured in a series of reaction center mutants of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with altered P/P+ midpoint potentials between 410 and 765 mV. The time constant for P+HA- recombination was found to range between 14 and 26 ns and was essentially independent of P/P+ midpoint potential. Previous work has shown that the time constant for initial electron transfer in these mutants at room temperature is also only weakly dependent on the P/P+ midpoint potential, ranging from about 2.5 ps to about 50 ps. These results, taken together, imply that heterogeneity in the P/P+ midpoint potential within the reaction center population is not likely the dominant cause of the substantial kinetic complexity observed in the decay of the excited singlet state of P on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. In addition, the pathway of P+HA- decay appears to be direct or via P+BA- rather than proceeding back through P, even in the highest-potential mutant, as is evident from the fact that the rate of P+HA- recombination is unaltered by pushing P+HA- much closer to P in energy. Finally, the midpoint potential independence of the P+HA- recombination rate constant suggests that the slow rate of P+HA- recombination arises from an inherent limitation in the maximum rate of this process rather than because it occurs in the inverted region of a classical Marcus rate vs free energy curve.</str>

      <str>In Thailand, DDT was banned for agriculture use in 1983 and for malaria vector control in 1999. However, contamination by DDT and its primary metabolite, p,p'-DDE remains serious environmental and human health concerns. The main focus of this study were i) to investigate serum concentrations of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT as exposure biomarkers for potential adverse health effect in adult Thai residents and ii) to compare the associations of BMI, thyroid hormones, cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting blood sugar levels in human serum with the concentrations of these pesticides. In a total of 1,137 participants were measured blood serum for analyses of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT. The geometric mean concentration (95% confidence interval) for serum total p,p'-DDE concentration was 1,539 (1,242-1,837) ng/g lipid and 1,547 (1,293-1,806) ng/g lipid in adult males and females, respectively. Furthermore, the total amount of serum p,p'-DDE concentration significantly correlated with plasma glucose levels. Neither p,p'-DDE nor p,p'-DDT was significantly associated with serum thyroid hormones levels. Additionally, the high p,p'-DDE/DDT ratio indicates that the exposure is due past rather than recent use of DDT.</str>

      <str>The effect of lipid peroxidation in vitro on the amounts of several forms of cytochrome P-450 in liver microsomes from guinea-pigs was investigated. Lipid peroxide formation in liver microsomes from ascorbic acid (VC)-deficient animals was much higher than that observed in control animals. The antibodies to rat P-450IA2 (P-448-H), P-450IIB1 (P-450b) and human P-450IIIA4 (P-450NF) recognized one or two forms of cytochrome P-450 in liver microsomes of guinea-pigs. Neither cytochrome P-450 cross-reactive with anti-P-450IIB1 antibodies nor cytochrome P-450 cross-reactive with antibodies to P-450IIIA4 was virtually affected by microsomal lipid peroxidation induced by NADPH in vitro. In contrast, the forms of cytochrome P-450 immunochemically related to P-450IA2 were decreased with the increased level of lipid peroxide formation. The form-specific degradation of cytochrome P-450 due to lipid peroxidation was in agreement with our previous observation that the amounts of cytochrome P-450 cross-reactive with antibodies to P-450IA2 but not with antibodies to P-450IIIA (P-450PB-1) were predominantly decreased in VC-deficient guinea-pigs compared to control animals in vitro.</str>

      <str>Attenuation of the P-wave amplitudes in patients with peripheral edema (PERED) has been recently reported, with P-waves regaining some of their amplitude in patients, who subsequently experienced amelioration of their PERED. Changes in the P-waves correlated with the corresponding alterations in the QRS complexes. Also since amplitudes and durations of QRS complexes changed in parallel in patients with PERED, it was hypothesized that similar changes in the P-wave amplitudes, mean P-wave duration (P-du-mean), and P-wave dispersion (P-d), would occur in such patients.</str>

      <str>Although P-wave amplitudes and P-wave areas decreased with development of PERED (N = 16), and increased with its amelioration (N = 6), P-dur-mean before PERED was 66.8+/-14.5 ms, and at peak weight gain it was 65.2+/-11.9 ms, p = 0.66; also at peak weight gain and subsequent lowest weight, in the patients who lost weight, it was 66.5+/-9.9 ms and 72.3+/-12.0 ms, respectively, p = 0.38. Similarly the P-d prior to PERED was 62.3+/-25.2 ms, and at peak weight gain it was 74.3+/-29.3 ms, p = 0.09; also at peak weight and subsequent lowest weight, in the patients who lost weight, it was 58.8+/-34.2 ms, and 61.3+/-13.6 ms, respectively, p = 0.87.</str>

      <str>Twenty-four (44%) of the tumors were p-gp positive and 31 (56%) were p-gp negative. Among the p-gp positive patients, 65% had recurrence of their disease, whereas only 13% of the p-gp negative patients experienced recurrence (p = 0.0001). The 5-year disease-free rate for p-gp positive patients was 39% compared with 83% for p-gp negative patients (p = 0.0001). In univariate analysis examining 10 different variables, significant predictors of recurrence were p-gp, stage, and tumor size. Multivariate analysis using Cox Proportional Hazards regression showed that only p-gp and stage were significant independent predictors of recurrence (p = 0.0002).</str>

      <str>Two forms of cytochrome P-450 (hepatoma P-450MCI and P-450MCII) were purified from hepatoma 5123D microsomes of tumor-bearing rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. Hepatoma P-450MCI had a specific content of 18.4 nmol/mg protein and showed a main protein band with a minimum molecular weight of 56,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Hepatoma P-450MCII had a specific content of 7.38 nmol/mg protein and a minimum molecular weight of 50,000. The carbon monoxide-reduced difference spectral peak of hepatoma P-450MCI was at 446.5 nm, whereas the peak of hepatoma P-450MCII was at 451 nm. In the reconstituted system, hepatoma P-450MCI catalyzed 3-hydroxylation of benzo[a]pyrene and O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin, but showed low activities for N-demethylation of benzphetamine and aminopyrine, O-demethylation of p-nitroanisole, and p-hydroxylation of aniline. On the other hand, hepatoma P-450MCII did not catalyze hydroxylation of any of the substrates tested. By Ouchterlony double-diffusion analysis, hepatoma P-450MCI was immunologically indistinguishable from rat liver cytochrome P-450c, but hepatoma P-450MCII was distinct from hepatoma P-450MCI and rat liver cytochrome P-450c. Peptide maps of hepatoma P-450MCI and rat liver cytochrome P-450c after proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease demonstrated the similarity of the two cytochromes P-450.</str>

      <str>Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), an organochlorine pollutant, is associated with several types of cancer. However, the relationship between DDT and colorectal cancer is uncertain. In this study, the impact of p,p'-DDT on colorectal cancer growth was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo models. Our results indicated that the proliferation of human colorectal adenocarcinoma DLD1 cells was significantly promoted after exposed to low concentrations of p,p'-DDT ranging from 10(-12) to 10(-7) M for 96 h. Exposure to p,p'-DDT from 10(-10) to 10(-8) M led to upregulation of phospho-GSK3β (Ser9), β-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 in DLD1 cells. RNA interference of β-catenin inhibited the proliferation of DLD1 cells stimulated by p,p'-DDT. Inhibiting of estrogen receptors (ERs) had no significant effect on the action of p,p'-DDT. Treatment with p,p'-DDT induced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in DLD1 cells. Treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor, suppressed the induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and DLD1 cell proliferation by p,p'-DDT. Moreover, in a mouse xenograft model, 5 nmol/kg p,p'-DDT resulted in increased tumor size, oxidative stress and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These results indicated that low concentrations of p,p'-DDT promoted colorectal cancer growth through Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which was mediated by oxidative stress. The finding suggests an association between low concentrations of p,p'-DDT exposure and colorectal cancer progression.</str>

      <str>In Europe, 10 among the 15 known species of the Paramecium aurelia complex have been recorded including P. primaurelia, P. biaurelia, P. triaurelia, P. tetraurelia, P. pentaurelia, P. sexaurelia, P. septaurelia, P. novaurelia, P. dodecaurelia, and P. tredecaurelia. The occurrence of species of this complex in Europe has been estimated on the basis of the number of habitats and the ratio value (r.v.), i.e. the number of habitats for a defined species to the total number of habitats with species of the P. aurelia complex. The r.v. presents the relative frequency of the particular species to others of the complex. In total, 483 habitats were considered. The dominant species is P. novaurelia (r.v. 0.38, found in 186 habitats), followed by P. biaurelia (r.v. 0.26 in 125 habitats) and P. primaurelia (0.23 in 113 habitats). Other species are less frequent, such as P. tetraurelia (r.v. 0.06 found in 29 habitats), P. triaurelia (r.v. 0.04 in 22 habitats), or rare such as P. septaurelia (r.v. 0.025 found in 12 habitats), as well as P. pentaurelia and P. sexaurelia (r.v. 0.02 for both, found in 11 and 10 habitats, respectively). P. dodecaurelia was found in three localities in Europe (r.v. 0.006) and P. tredecaurelia is known from a single habitat (r.v. 0.002). This paper presents new populations, found at present, of species of the P. aurelia complex in Europe (Germany, Italy, Spain, Iceland, Poland, Great Britain) and one new from the USA.</str>

      <str>Field experiments were conducted to optimize the phytoextraction of weathered p,p'-DDE (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) by Cucurbita subspecies. The effects of two soil amendments, mycorrhizae or a biosurfactant, on p,p'-DDE accumulation was determined. Also, p,p'-DDE uptake was assessed during plant growth (12, 26, 38, and 62 d), and cultivars that accumulate weathered p,p'-DDE were intercropped with cultivars known not to have that ability. Cucurbita pepo L. ssp. pepo accumulated large amounts of the contaminant, having stem bioconcentration factors, amounts of p,p'-DDE translocated, and contaminant phytoextraction that were 14, 9.9, and 5.0 times greater than C. pepo L. ssp. ovifera (L.) D.S. Decker, respectively. During 62 d, the stem BCF (bioconcentration factor) for p,p'-DDE in subspecies pepo remained constant and the total amount of contaminant accumulated was correlated with plant biomass (r(2) = 0.86). For subspecies ovifera, the stem BCF was highest at 12 d (1.5) but decreased to 0.39 by 62 d, and p,p'-DDE removal was not correlated with plant biomass. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased p,p'-DDE accumulation by both subspecies by an average 4.4 times. For subspecies pepo, mycorrhizae increased the percentage of contaminant extracted from 0.72 to 2.1%. Biosurfactant amendment also enhanced contaminant accumulation by both subspecies, although treatment reduced subspecies ovifera biomass by 60%. The biosurfactant had no effect on the biomass of subspecies pepo, increased the average contaminant concentration by 3.6-fold, and doubled the overall amount of p,p'-DDE removed from the soil. Soil amendments that enhance the mobility of weathered persistent organic pollutants will significantly increase the amount of contaminant phytoextraction by Cucurbita pepo.</str>

      <str>Physical, chemical, or biological treatment of animal liquid manure generally produces a dry-matter rich fraction (DMF) that contains most of the initial phosphorus (P). Our objective was to assess the solubility and plant availability of P from various DMFs as a function of soil P status. Eight different DMFs were obtained from liquid swine (LSM) and dairy cattle (LDC) manures treated by natural decantation, anaerobic digestion, chemical flocculation, composting, or mechanical separation. The DMFs were compared with mineral P fertilizer in a pot experiment with oat ( L.) grown in four soils with varied P-fixing capacities and P saturation levels. The DMFs were added at a rate of 50 mg P kg soil and incubated 14 d before seeding. Soil water-extractable P (P) at all water:soil extraction ratios (2:1, 20:1, and 200:1) was slightly higher when DMFs were derived from LDC rather than LSM. Soil P at the 2:1 ratio was lower with anaerobically digested LSM. At the 2:1 extraction ratio, DMF P was less soluble than mineral P as P saturation in soils increased. In soils with a lower P-fixing capacity, DMF P appeared less water soluble than mineral P under 20:1 and 200:1 extraction ratios. After 72 d of plant growth, DMFs produced yields comparable to mineral P fertilizer. Although the plant availability of P from DMFs was comparable to mineral P fertilizer, P from DMFs could be less vulnerable to leaching or runoff losses in soils with a high P saturation level or low P-fixing capacity.</str>

      <str>Incorporating applied phosphorus (P) sources can reduce P runoff losses and is a recommended best management practice. However, in soils with low P retention capacities, leaching can be a major mechanism for off-site P loss, and the P-source application method (surface or incorporation) may not significantly affect the total amount of off-site P loss. We utilized simulated rainfall protocols to investigate effects of P-source characteristics and application methods on the forms and amounts of P losses from six P sources, including five biosolids materials produced and/or marketed in Florida, and one inorganic fertilizer (triple superphosphate). A typical Florida Spodosol (Immokalee fine sand; sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Alaquods) was used for the study, to which the P sources were each applied at a rate of 224 kg P ha(-1) (approximately the P rate associated with N-based biosolids applications). The P sources were either surface-applied to the soil or incorporated into the soil to a depth of 5 cm. Amended soils were subjected to three simulated rainfall events, at 1-d intervals. Runoff and leachate were collected after each rainfall event and analyzed for P losses in the form of soluble reactive P (SRP), total dissolved P (TDP), total P (TP), and bioavailable P (BAP) (in runoff only). Cumulative masses (runoff + leachate for the three rainfall events) of P losses from all the P sources were similar, whether the amendments were surface-applied or incorporated into the soil. The solubility of the amendment, rather than application method, largely determines the P loss potential in poorly P-sorbing Florida Spodosols.</str>

      <str>Due to their geographic location and traditional diet, rich in seafood and marine mammals, the Inuit living in Arctic Quebec are exposed to high amounts of pollutants, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). While the adverse developmental effects of these pesticides on child cognitive functions are well known, the effects of developmental exposure to OP on sensory processes have not been investigated. The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the effects of prenatal and childhood exposure to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 1,1,-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), on visual processing in Inuit children in Nunavik (Arctic Québec). p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE concentrations were determined from umbilical cord and 5- and 11-year plasma samples. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were successfully recorded in 150 children at 4 contrast levels (95%, 30%, 12%, and 4%). Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to determine the association between p,p'-DDT, or p,p'-DDE, exposure and VEPs while controlling for the effects of various confounders, including fish nutrients and other contaminants. p,p'-DDE measured in umbilical cord plasma was significantly related to the amplitude of the N150 response at the lowest contrast (4%). In addition, 5-year p,p'-DDE plasma concentration was significantly associated with decreased N75 amplitude. These findings indicate that p,p'-DDE exposure, both pre- and postnatally, during early childhood is associated with visual processing impairment later in life. </str>

      <str>Animal manure amended soils often contain large amounts of bioavailable phosphorus (P) and constitute high risk for the deterioration of surface water quality through eutrophication. Current standards set for the safe disposal of animal manure through soil application are based on the assumption that phosphorus in all P sources would behave similarly. The primary objective of this study was to understand the influence of P from several manure and mineral fertilizer sources applied at 0, 50, and 150 mg P kg(-1) on two measures of bioavailable P to six soils of different initial soil test P levels using corn (Zea mays L.) P uptake and an iron oxide strip method for soil analysis (FeO-P). Total net bioavailable P (TNBP) was calculated by subtracting total P uptake by corn after seven consecutive harvests in control treatments that did not receive P from the P uptake from P-amended treatments. Net biovavailable P after the first harvest (NBP1) was calculated in a similar fashion but only using data from the first harvest. Significant differences in TNBP and NBP1 were found when comparing P sources. The hog (Sus scrofa) manure had the greatest P bioavailability while turkey (Meleagris gallopava) litter had the lowest among the animal P sources across all soils and levels of P application. Significant differences were also found between soils with the highest amounts of TNBP and NBP1 found in the Woodson soil and lowest detected in the Crete soil for most P sources. The FeO-P method was useful in predicting TNBP from most P sources.</str>

      <str>Osmotin, a protein from the pathogenesis-related family (PR-5), has been identified as an allergen based on in-silico and in-vitro studies. In the present study, three B cell epitopes of osmotin with single and double amino acid modifications were studied for immunotherapy in a murine model. The single-modification peptides (P-1-1, P-2-1 and P-3-1) and double-modification peptides (P-1-2, P-2-2 and P-3-2) showed significantly lower immunoglobulin (Ig)E binding with patients' sera compared to osmotin (P &lt; 0·01). These peptides showed reduced IgE binding compared to the unmodified peptides (B cell epitopes) P-1, P-2 and P-3. Among the modified peptides, P-2-1, P-3-1, P-2-2 and P-3-2 showed significant reduction in IgE binding and were used for immunotherapy in mice. The sera of mice group treated with peptides showed a significant increase in IgG2a level and a significant decrease in IgE and IgG1 levels (P &lt; 0·05). The mice that received peptide immunotherapy showed a shift from a T helper type 2 (Th2) to Th1 type where interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were elevated, with a significant increase in groups treated with peptides P-3-1 and P-3-2 (P &lt; 0·05). There was a reduction in the IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in the peptide-treated mice groups. Total cell count and eosinophil count in BALF of the peptide-treated groups was also reduced compared to the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated group. Lung histology showed a significant reduction in cellular infiltrate in mice treated with P-2-2 and P-3-2 compared to PBS. In conclusion, peptides P-2-2 and P-3-2 lowered inflammatory responses and induced a Th1 response in mice. </str>

      <str>Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been used broadly in China's past, yet very little is known about their atmospheric concentrations and transport. In this work, air samples were collected in the Taihu Lake Region, China, from July 23 to August 11, 2002, to measure concentrations of OC pesticides in air. The average concentrations of alpha and gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), heptachlor (HEPT), alpha-endosulfan, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and o,p'-DDT in the air were 74 and 46, 47, 53, 307, 124, 212, 36, and 767 pg m(-3), respectively. It was interesting to note that the concentrations of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and o,p'-DDT were all very high, even though the use of technical DDT has been banned in China since 1983. Moreover, the average concentration ratios of o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT were as high as 6.3 and 1.8. This suggested that there could be an unknown source of DDT-related compounds (DDTs), especially o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE. It is very likely that this unknown source was the application of dicofol, an acaricide manufactured from technical DDT and used mainly on cotton fields to treat mites in China. Backward trajectory analysis also provided consistent evidence that the high air concentrations of DDTs were related to trajectories from the area north of the Yangtze River, where cotton fields account for a significant fraction of land use.</str>

      <str>A series of chlorinated hydrocarbons of interest in environmental toxicology were investigated concerning their effects on human platelet aggregation. Most potent in inhibiting platelet aggregation were p,p'-DDE and Arochlor 1242. Aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (1 mM) was more sensitive to inhibition by p,p'-DDE than was aggregation induced by ADP (10 microM). The former was completely inhibited by p,p'-DDE at a concentration of 1 x 10(-4) M, whereas there was only a 31% inhibition of the latter. Addition of Ca2+ (1 mM) blocked the inhibitory effect of p,p'-DDE on aggregation induced by both arachidonic acid and ADP. Calmodulin (1 microgram/ml) blocked the inhibitory effect of p,p'-DDE on aggregation induced by arachidonic acid but not that induced by ADP. The calmodulin inhibitory drugs trifluoperazine and calmidazolium had no effect at all or only a weak effect (-14%), respectively, on platelet aggregation. Increasing the concentrations of p,p'-DDE and Arochlor 1242 caused a delay in the onset of aggregation induced by the addition of arachidonic acid. The synthesis of thromboxane B2 and other prostaglandins in platelet membranes was dose-dependently reduced by p,p'-DDE. The structurally closely related isomers o,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT did not significantly inhibit arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation or thromboxane B2 synthesis. It is concluded that p,p'-DDE and Arochlor 1242 inhibited platelet aggregation by inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase activity.</str>

      <str>Combining technologies offer a great potential to phytoremediate contaminated soils. As sequestration occurs, pollutants availability decline and organic amendments could counterbalance that situation. This work studies the potential of willow plants to phytoremediate soil containing p,p'-DDT (101.3 ng g(-1)) and p,p'-DDE (381.4 ng g(-1)) residues. The effect of root exudates, Tween 80 and citric and oxalic acids on DDTs desorption and availability from soil was tested together with the plant uptake and translocation. Treatments increased the p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT ratio when compared with control (water) soil. Watering with carboxylic acids led to a significant enhancement of the quantities of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE desorbed from soil that was related with an increase of organic carbon in solution. Willow plants accumulated DDTs under all treatments although plants watered with carboxylic acids showed the highest leaves translocation factor for both p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE. Results indicate that the addition of carboxylic acids enhanced DDTs bioavailability which further increases plant uptake and translocation. The effect of surfactants on the soil-plant systems needs to be better assessed for this particular soil and plant species. The enhancement of soluble organic carbon is crucial at the moment of evaluating DDTs release from soil as well as to establish cleaning strategies.</str>

      <str>Ab initio MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ searches of the potential surfaces of (H2C═PX)2 complexes, with X = F, Cl, OH, CN, NC, CCH, H, CH3, and BH2, have been carried out to identify and characterize the properties of complexes with P···P pnicogen bonds. All (H2C═PX)2 form equilibrium conformation A dimers with C(2h) symmetry in which A-P···P-A approaches a linear alignment, with A the atom of X directly bonded to P. Conformation A dimers containing the more electronegative substituents are stabilized by a P···P pnicogen bond, have shorter P-P distances, and have binding energies which correlate with the P-P distance. Dimers stabilized by a P···P pnicogen bond and two P···H(b) interactions consist of those with the more electropositive substituents, have shorter P-H(b) distances, and have binding energies which are too high for their P-P distances. Conformation A complexes with P···H(b) interactions in addition to the P···P bond are more stable than the corresponding (PH2X)2 complexes, while with only one exception, complexes stabilized by only a P···P bond are less stable than the corresponding (PH2X)2 complexes. In the region of the potential surfaces with C-P···P-C approaching linearity (conformation B), the only planar equilibrium complex is (H2C═POH)2, which is stabilized primarily by two O-H···P hydrogen bonds. The remaining (H2C═PX)2 complexes are not stabilized by pnicogen bonds, but by π interactions between the two H2C═PX monomers which are in parallel planes. When A-P···P-C approaches linearity, two types of equilibrium structures with P···P bonds exist. Of the conformation C dimers, (H2C═POH)2 is planar and the most stable, with a P···P pnicogen bond and an O-H···P hydrogen bond. (H2C═PH)2 and (H2C═PCH3)2 are also planar, and stabilized by a P···P pnicogen bond and a P···H(b) interaction. The absence of a P···H(b) interaction results in nonplanar C' conformations with structures in which the monomers essentially retain their symmetry plane, but the plane of one molecule is rotated about the P···P bond relative to the other. C and C' dimers are less stable than the corresponding A dimers, except for (H2C═PCH3)2. (31)P chemical shielding patterns are consistent with the changing nature of the interactions which stabilize (H2C═PX)2 complexes. EOM-CCSD (31)P-(31)P spin-spin coupling constants increase quadratically as the P-P distance decreases.</str>

      <str>Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) particles are widely encountered in occupational settings. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a well-characterized environmental carcinogen, is frequently adsorbed onto particles. It has been shown that B[a]P-coated Fe2O3 particles (B[a]P-Fe2O3) significantly increased lung tumors in the hamster in contrast to B[a]P-coated Al2O3 (B[a]P-Al2O3) or B[a]P alone. In order to determine the genotoxic effects of these particles on the metabolism of B[a]P, pulmonary alveolar macrophages (AM) from male Syrian golden hamsters were incubated with 5 microg (19.8 nmol) B[a]P-coated respirable size (99% &lt; 5 microm) Fe2O3 and Al2O3 particles with loads from 0.5 to 2.0 mg. Intracellular uptake of B[a]P by AM at 24 h was higher with B[a]P-Fe2O3 than that of B[a]P alone (P &lt; 0.05) or B[a]P-Al2O3 (P &lt; 0.05). Total B[a]P metabolism was significantly greater in AM exposed to B[a]P-coated Fe2O3 at 1.0 and 1.5 mg than in the AM exposed to B[a]p-al2O3 (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg) (P &lt; 0.05) or B[a]P alone (P &lt; 0.05). Similar significant differences for Fe2O3 relative to Al2O3 and B[a]P alone were also apparent for total dihydrodiols, quinones and phenolic metabolites. Co-administration of 5 microg alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha-NF, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-4501A1 and P-4501A2) and 10(-3) M cyclohexene oxide (CO, an inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase) significantly reduced B[a]P metabolism in B[a]P-Fe2O3 (P &lt; 0.05) and B[a]P-Al2O3 (P &lt; 0.05) treated groups relative to B[a]P alone. AM were co-cultured with hamster tracheal epithelial cells (HTE) and treated as described above for metabolism studies to assess the DNA binding of B[a]P metabolites in the target cells, using 32P-postlabeling techniques. Two adducts were observed that had chromatographic behavior similar to 7R,8S,9S-trihydroxy-10R-(N2-deoxyguanosyl-3'-phosphate)-7,8,9,10-t etrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene [(+)-anti-BPDE-dG, adduct 1, major adduct representing 70-80% of total adducts] and 7S,8R,9R-trihydroxy-10S-(N2-deoxyguanosyl-3'-phosphate)-7,8,9,10-t etrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene [(-)-anti-BPDE-dG, adduct 2, representing 20-30% of total adducts]. B[a]P-Fe2O3 treatment enhanced the levels of the two B[a]P-DNA adducts in the HTE compared with B[a]P-Al2O3 (P &lt; 0.05) or B[a]P alone. The inhibitors alphaNF and CO significantly reduced total adduct levels in the HTE (P &lt; 0.05) in the B[a]P and B[a]P-Fe2O3 treatments as well as adduct 1 and adduct 2 levels. Our data suggest that the cocarcinogenic effect of B[a]P-Fe2O3 relative to B[a]P-coated Al2O3 can be due to: (i) the enhancement of B[a]P metabolism in AM by Fe2O3 associated with the increased uptake of B[a]P; and (ii) augmentation of DNA adduct formation in epithelial cells.</str>

      <str>(1) Among the 41 cases, the positive expression of P-gp protein was detected in 8 cases, MRP in 7 cases, LRP in 15 cases, and mdr 1 mRNA in 11 cases. (2) The P-gp and LRP levels in NHL were significantly higher than those in control group, but MRP wasn't. The P-gp over-expression was significantly associated with mdr1mRNA (r = 0.396, P = 0.01). No correlation was showed among the expressions of P-gp, MRP and LRP. (3) Patients with P-gp expression had a poorer outcome of chemotherapy than those with P-gp-negative (P = 0.005). P-gp expression was significantly associated with higher clinical stage (P = 0.046) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0.032), but not associated with malignant degree (P = 0.298).

      <str>Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, a key enzyme in phototransduction, is composed of P alpha beta and two P gamma subunits. Interaction of P gamma with P alpha beta or with the alpha subunit (T alpha) of transducin is crucial for the regulation of cGMP phosphodiesterase in retinal photoreceptors. Here we have investigated phosphorylation of P gamma by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and its functional effect on the P gamma interaction with P alpha beta or T alpha in vitro. P gamma, but not P gamma complexed with T alpha (both GTP and GDP forms), is phosphorylated. Measurement of 32P radioactivity in phosphorylated P gamma, analysis of phosphorylated P gamma by laser mass spectrometry, identification of phosphoamino acid, and phosphorylation of mutant forms of P gamma indicate that only threonine 35 in P gamma is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of P gamma mutants also reveals that the C and N terminals of P gamma which are required for the regulation of P alpha beta functions are not involved in the P gamma phosphorylation but that arginine 33, which is ADP-ribosylated by an endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferase, is required for the phosphorylation. Phosphorylated P gamma has a higher inhibitory activity for trypsin-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase than nonphosphorylated P gamma, indicating that the P gamma-P alpha beta interaction is affected by P gamma phosphorylation. Nonphosphorylated P gamma inhibits both the GTPase activity of T alpha and the binding of a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue to T alpha, while P gamma phosphorylation reduces these inhibitory activities. These observations suggest that a P gamma domain containing threonine 35 is involved in the P gamma-T alpha interaction, and P gamma phosphorylation regulates the P gamma-T alpha interaction. Our observation suggests that P gamma phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase may function for the regulation of phototransduction in vertebrate rod photoreceptors.</str>

      <str>Hybridomas were formed from myeloma cells and spleen cells derived from BALB/c female mice immunized with purified liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 2c/RLM5 (P-450 gene IIC11) isolated from untreated adult male rats. Six hybridoma clones produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of the IgM(kappa) type. All the MAbs bound strongly to P-450 2c/RLM5 when measured by radioimmunoassay, and four of the six specifically immunoprecipitated P-450 2c/RLM5 in an Ouchterlony double-immunodiffusion test. These four MAbs also bound but did not immunoprecipitate P-450 RLM3. The MAbs that precipitated P-450 2c/RLM5 neither bound nor precipitated P-450 PB-B (gene IIB1) and P-450 BNF-B (gene IA1) of rats or P-450 LM2 and P-450 LM4 of rabbits. In contrast, mouse polyclonal anti-P-450 2c/RLM5 antibody strongly immunoprecipitated P-450 RLM3 as well as P-450 2c/RLM5 and to a lesser extent P-450 PB-B and P-450 LM2. The MAbs that precipitated P-450 2c/RLM5 also inhibited by more than 90% androstenedione 16 alpha-hydroxylase activity of untreated rat microsomes, but did not inhibit microsomal 6 beta- or 7 alpha-hydroxylation. In addition, complete inhibition of both androstenedione 16 alpha-hydroxylation and testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylation was observed in a reconstituted system with P-450 2c/RLM5. Androstenedione 6 beta-hydroxylation catalyzed by P-450 2c/RLM5 was also inhibited, whereas P-450 3-catalyzed 7 alpha-hydroxylation was not inhibited by the MAbs. P-450 2c/RLM5 catalyzed 2 alpha-, 16 alpha- and 6 beta-hydroxylation of progesterone in a reconstituted system were also inhibited by the MAb by 60-80%. These MAbs should prove useful for "reaction phenotyping," i.e. for defining the contribution of microsomal P-450 2c/RLM5 to the oxidative metabolism of endogenous steroids and other P-450 substrates in animal and human tissues.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp/P-170), a transmembrane efflux pump known to be one of the mechanisms responsible for multidrug resistance in cancer therapy, is constitutively expressed in several solid human tissues as well as in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow cells. In particular, this molecule has been associated with the transport of perforin and other cytolysins in natural killer (NK) and T cytotoxic lymphocytes. In the present study, we analyzed peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from controls and HIV+ patients for phenotypic expression and function of the P-gp/P-170 molecule. We found that 90% of all PBL subsets (i.e., CD4+, CD8+, CD56+, and CD19+ cells) expressed surface P-gp/P-170 both in controls and HIV+ patients. However, a significant decrease in CD4+/P-170+ and CD19+/P-170+ cells was observed in HIV+ individuals with respect to controls. PHA and IL-2 stimulation of PBLs was unable to increase the expression of P-gp/P-170 both in controls and HIV+ patients, despite the increased detection of the CD25 molecule. On the other hand, stimulation with anti-CD3 determined a significant increase in lymphocyte P-gp/P-170. The function of P-gp/P-170, assessed by a flow cytometric assay for rhodamine-123 (Rh123) efflux, was significantly reduced in CD16+ NK cells and CD19+ B cells from HIV+ patients. The Rh123 efflux by NK cells correlated (p &lt; 0.01) with the NK cytotoxicity against the 51Cr-labeled K562 cell line. Last, the effect of the antiretroviral drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC on P-gp expression and function was evaluated. The dideoxynucleoside compounds did not inhibit P-gp/P-170 function of normal mononuclear cells in vitro, and did not increase P-gp/P-170 expression in vivo, in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy with AZT. These findings provide further evidence of a possible involvement of the P-gp/P-170 system in specific immunological lymphocyte functions, and especially in cytotoxic-type functions. In addition, it is possible to suggest, on the basis of our experimental data, that the dideoxynucleoside class of antiretroviral agents does not contribute to the phenotypic and functional alterations related to P-glycoprotein during HIV infection.</str>

Species misidentification by microscopy has been reported in areas co-endemic for vivax and falciparum malaria, and may be more frequent in regions where Plasmodium knowlesi also commonly occurs.</str>
      <str>This prospective study in Sabah, Malaysia, evaluated the accuracy of routine district and referral hospital-based microscopy, and microscopy performed by an experienced research microscopist, for the diagnosis of PCR-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum, P. knowlesi, and Plasmodium vivax malaria.</str>
      <str>A total of 304 patients with PCR-confirmed Plasmodium infection were enrolled, including 130 with P. knowlesi, 122 with P. falciparum, 43 with P. vivax, one with Plasmodium malariae and eight with mixed species infections. Among patients with P. knowlesi mono-infection, routine and cross-check microscopy both identified 94 (72%) patients as "P. malariae/P. knowlesi"; 17 (13%) and 28 (22%) respectively were identified as P. falciparum, and 13 (10%) and two (1.5%) as P. vivax. Among patients with PCR-confirmed P. falciparum, routine and cross-check microscopy identified 110/122 (90%) and 112/118 (95%) patients respectively as P. falciparum, and 8/122 (6.6%) and 5/118 (4.2%) as "P. malariae/P. knowlesi". Among those with P. vivax, 23/43 (53%) and 34/40 (85%) were correctly diagnosed by routine and cross-check microscopy respectively, while 13/43 (30%) and 3/40 (7.5%) patients were diagnosed as "P. malariae/P. knowlesi". Four of 13 patients with PCR-confirmed P. vivax and misdiagnosed by routine microscopy as "P. malariae/P. knowlesi" were subsequently re-admitted with P. vivax malaria.</str>
      <str>Microscopy does not reliably distinguish between P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi in a region where all three species frequently occur. Misdiagnosis of P. knowlesi as both P. vivax and P. falciparum, and vice versa, is common, potentially leading to inappropriate treatment, including chloroquine therapy for P. falciparum and a lack of anti-relapse therapy for P. vivax. The limitations of microscopy in P. knowlesi-endemic areas supports the use of unified blood-stage treatment strategies for all Plasmodium species, the development of accurate rapid diagnostic tests suitable for all species, and the use of PCR-confirmation for accurate surveillance.</str>

      <str>To investigate the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) and progesterone (P) on the expression of IRS in human osteoblast cells (HOBs) and further study the mechanism of E(2) and P on postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP).</str>
      <str>Osteoblasts from cancellous bones of normal adults were cultured and underwent intervention of E(2) and P respectively. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of mRNAs of IRS-1 and IRS-2. The expression of the proteins of IRS-1 and IRS-2 were detected by Western blotting. The expressions of phosphorylated IRS protein (P-IRS) was examined by immunocoprecipitation/Western blotting.</str>
      <str>The expression level of IRS-2 mRNA in the HOBs undergoing intervention of E(2) and P were 421% +/- 68% and 327% +/- 54% that of the control group respectively (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01). The expression level of IRS-2 mRNA in the HOBs undergoing intervention of E(2) combined with P was 496% +/- 54% that of the control group (P &lt; 0.01). However, the expression level of IRS-1 was not significantly influenced by E(2) and/or P (all P &gt; 0.05). The expression level of IRS-2 protein and phophorylated IRS-2 protein in the HOBs undergoing intervention of E(2), P, and E(2) combined with P were 487% +/- 65%, 507% +/- 54%, 552% +/- 47% and 483% +/- 52%, 527% +/- 76%, and 717% +/- 86% that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, and P &lt; 0.05). The P-IRS-1 protein level of the HOBs undergoing intervention of E(2), P, and E(2) combined with P were 54% +/- 7.6%, 37% +/- 4.2%, and 21.2% +/- 3.0% that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, and P &lt; 0.01).</str>
      <str>E(2) and P up-regulate the expression of IRS-2 mRNA in HOBs. Combined intervention of E(2) and P positively creates a synergistic effect on the up-regulation of IRS-2 mRNA. E(2) and P have no effects on the expression of IRS-1 mRNA. E(2) and P increase the expression of IRS-2 protein and P-IRS-2. Combined intervention of E(2) and P presents a positive synergistic effect on the up-regulation of P-IRS-2. However, they show no effect on the expression of IRS-1 protein, and down regulate the phosphorylation of IRS-1 protein.</str>

      <str>Two experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of Natuphos phytase for improving P availability of soybean meal-based semipurified diets (SP, Experiments 1 and 2) and corn-soybean meal-based diets (CS, Experiment 2) fed to broilers (1 to 21 d). There were 360 and 288 birds fed the SP diets in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and 288 birds were fed the CS diets in Experiment 2. Phosphorus equivalency values for phytase were calculated. The basal diets were formulated to contain 0.27% nonphytate P (nP); the SP basal diet contained 0.45% total P (tP) that included 0.17% P as defluorinated phosphate; the CS basal diet contained 0.51% tP that contained 0.12% P as defluorinated phosphate. Both basal diets were supplemented with defluorinated phosphate to provide 0.36, 0.45, of 0.54% nP or with 350, 700, or 1,050 U of phytase/kg diets. Supplementing defluorinated phosphate and phytase linearly increased BW gain (P &lt; 0.001), feed intake (P &lt; 0.001), and percentage ash of dried toes (P &lt; 0.01). Phytase addition increased apparent retention of P (P &lt; 0.02), Ca (P &lt; 0.005 in Experiment 2), and N (P &lt;0.06 in Experiment 2 for CS), increased apparent digestibility of DM (P &lt; 0.04), and linearly decreased (P &lt;0.005) P excretion. In comparison to the 0.45% np diet, P excretion was reduced 42 to 51% by addition of phytase. The addition of defluorinated phosphate linearly decreased apparent retention of P (P &lt; 0.02) and Ca (P &lt; 0.005 in Experiment 2), and increased P excretion (P &lt; 0.007). The average of released P by phytase calculated by solving nonlinear or linear response equations of P and phytase levels for SP diets in Experiments 1 and 2 gave a P equivalency value 1 g P = 1,146 U of phytase. The P equivalency value for CS diets fed only in Experiment 2 was 785 U of phytase = 1 g P as defluorinated phosphate. These studies show that microbial phytase is effective for improving P availability and for decreasing P excretion. Added phytase can also increase Ca and N retention.</str>

      <str>Children with obesity and insulin resistance (IR) have decreased adiponectin and have increased cardiovascular risk. Adiponectin has antiatherogenic effects, but its mechanism is unclear.</str>
      <str>Our objectives were 1) to compare lipoprotein subclass particles among obese and lean adolescents and delineate their relationships with IR and 2) to measure relationships between adiponectin and lipoproteins and their dependence on body mass index (BMI) and/or IR. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This was a cross-sectional study of 57 obese and 38 lean pubertal adolescents, measuring lipoprotein subclass particles (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), lipids, adiponectin, and homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR).</str>
      <str>Obese had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = 0.018), higher small LDL particles (LDL-P) (P &lt; 0.0005), smaller LDL-P size (P &lt; 0.0005), smaller high-density lipoprotein particle (HDL-P) size (P &lt; 0.0005), lower HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (P &lt; 0.0005), and higher small HDL-P (P = 0.009) compared with lean. HOMA-IR was higher in obese than lean (P &lt; 0.0005) and positively associated with triglycerides, large very LDL-P, and small HDL-P and negatively with HDL-P size in obese. Adiponectin was lower in obese than lean (P &lt; 0.0005) and was positively associated with LDL-P size, HDL-P size, and HDL-C and negatively with triglycerides, small LDL-P, large very LDL-P, and small HDL-P in obese. Using linear regression adjusting for demographics, Tanner stage, BMI, and HOMA-IR in all adolescents, adiponectin was positively associated with LDL-P size (P = 0.028), HDL-P size (P &lt; 0.0005), and HDL-C (P = 0.042) and negatively with small LDL-P (P = 0.009) and small HDL-P (P = 0.004).</str>
      <str>Obese adolescents have lower adiponectin levels than lean, and a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile, associated with increased IR. Adiponectin was inversely associated with atherogenic lipoproteins in adolescents, even after adjusting for obesity and IR. This is the first such report in children, and suggests a relationship between adiponectin and lipoproteins in adolescents independent of BMI and IR.</str>

      <str>Organochlorine compounds such as 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane (p,p'-DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE), and some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are carcinogenic to animals and possibly also to human beings. Occupational exposure to DDT may increase the risk of pancreas cancer. The high frequency of K-ras mutations in pancreatic cancer remains unexplained. We analysed the relation between serum concentrations of selected organochlorine compounds and mutations in codon 12 of the K-ras gene in patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer.</str>
      <str>Cases were prospectively identified in five hospitals. Mutations in K-ras were analysed by PCR and artificial restriction fragment length polymorphism. Cases of pancreatic cancer with wild-type K-ras (n=17) were frequency matched for age and sex to cases of pancreatic cancer with a K-ras mutation (n=34, case-case study). These 51 cases were further compared with 26 hospital controls (case-control comparison). Serum organochlorine concentrations were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron-capture detection and negative ion chemical ionisation mass spectrometry.</str>
      <str>Serum concentrations of p,p'-DDT were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer cases with a K-ras mutation than in cases without a mutation (odds ratio for upper tertile 8.7 [95% CI 1.6-48.5], p for trend=0.005). For p,p'-DDE the corresponding figures were 5.3 (1.1-25.2, p for trend=0.031). These estimates held after adjusting for total lipids, other covariates, and total PCBs. A specific association was observed between a glycine to valine substitution at codon 12 and both p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE concentrations (odds ratio 15.9, p=0.044 and odds ratio 24.1, p=0.028; respectively). A similar pattern was shown for the major di-ortho-chlorinated PCBs (congeners 138, 153, and 180), even after adjustment for p,p'-DDE, but without a specific association with spectrum. Concentrations of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE were similar among wild-type cases and controls, but significantly higher for K-ras mutated cases than for controls (p&lt;0.01).</str>
      <str>Organochlorine compounds such as p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and some PCBs could play a part in the pathogenesis of exocrine pancreatic cancer through modulation of K-ras activation. The results require replication, but they suggest new roles for organochlorines in the development of several cancers in human beings.</str>

      <str>The function of the appendix is largely unknown, but its microbiota likely contributes to function. Alterations in microbiota may contribute to appendicitis, but conventional culture studies have not yielded conclusive information. We conducted a pilot, culture-independent 16S rRNA-based microbiota study of paired appendix and rectal samples.</str>
      <str>We collected appendix and rectal swabs from 21 children undergoing appendectomy, six with normal appendices and fifteen with appendicitis (nine perforated). After DNA extraction, we amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes and analyzed sequences using CLoVR. We identified organisms differing in relative abundance using ANOVA (p&lt;0.05) by location (appendix vs. rectum), disease (appendicitis vs. normal), and disease severity (perforated vs. non-perforated).</str>
      <str>We identified 290 taxa in the study's samples. Three taxa were significantly increased in normal appendices vs. normal rectal samples: Fusibacter (p = 0.009), Selenomonas (p = 0.026), and Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.049). Five taxa were increased in abundance in normal vs. diseased appendices: Paenibacillaceae (p = 0.005), Acidobacteriaceae GP4 (p = 0.019), Pseudonocardinae (p = 0.019), Bergeyella (p = 0.019) and Rhizobium (p = 0.045). Twelve taxa were increased in the appendices of appendicitis patients vs. normal appendix: Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.0003), Bilophila (p = 0.0004), Bulleidia (p = 0.012), Fusobacterium (p = 0.018), Parvimonas (p = 0.003), Mogibacterium (p = 0.012), Aminobacterium (p = 0.019), Proteus (p = 0.028), Actinomycineae (p = 0.028), Anaerovorax (p = 0.041), Anaerofilum (p = 0.045), Porphyromonas (p = 0.010). Five taxa were increased in appendices in patients with perforated vs. nonperforated appendicitis: Bulleidia (p = 0.004), Fusibacter (p = 0.005), Prevotella (p = 0.021), Porphyromonas (p = 0.030), Dialister (p = 0.035). Three taxa were increased in rectum samples of patients with appendicitis compared to the normal patients: Bulleidia (p = 0.034), Dialister (p = 0.003), and Porphyromonas (p = 0.026).</str>
      <str>Specific taxa are more abundant in normal appendices compared to the rectum, suggesting that a distinctive appendix microbiota exists. Taxa with altered abundance in diseased and severely diseased (perforated) samples may contribute to appendicitis pathogenesis, and may provide microbial signatures in the rectum useful for guiding both treatment and diagnosis of appendicitis.</str>

      <str>Previously, we reported the development of a microarray-based method for the identification of five clinically relevant G genotypes (G1 to G4 and G9) (V. Chizhikov et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 40:2398-2407, 2002). The expanded version of the rotavirus microarray assay presented herein is capable of identifying (i) five clinically relevant human rotavirus VP4 genotypes (P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], and P[14]) and (ii) five additional human rotavirus VP7 genotypes (G5, G6, G8, G10, and G12) on one chip. Initially, a total of 80 cell culture-adapted human and animal reference rotavirus strains of known P (P[1] to P[12], P[14], P[16], and P[20]) and G (G1-6, G8 to G12, and G14) genotypes isolated in various parts of the world were employed to evaluate the new microarray assay. All rotavirus strains bearing P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], or P[14] and/or G1 to G6, G8 to G10, or G12 specificity were identified correctly. In addition, cross-reactivity to viruses of genotype G11, G13, or G14 or P[1] to P[3], P[5], P[7], P[10] to P[12], P[16], or P[20] was not observed. Next, we analyzed a total of 128 rotavirus-positive human stool samples collected in three countries (Brazil, Ghana, and the United States) by this assay and validated its usefulness. The results of this study showed that the assay was sensitive and specific and capable of unambiguously discriminating mixed rotavirus infections from nonspecific cross-reactivity; the inability to discriminate mixed infections from nonspecific cross-reactivity is one of the inherent shortcomings of traditional multiplex reverse transcription-PCR genotyping. Moreover, because the hybridization patterns exhibited by rotavirus strains of different genotypes can vary, this method may be ideal for analyzing the genetic polymorphisms of the VP7 or VP4 genes of rotaviruses.</str>

      <str>Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an important, unexplained cause of death in epilepsy. Role of cardiopulmonary abnormalities in the pathophysiology of SUDEP is unclear in the pediatric population. Our objective was to assess cardiopulmonary abnormalities during epileptic seizures in children, with the long-term goal of identifying potential mechanisms of SUDEP.</str>
      <str>We prospectively recorded cardiopulmonary functions using pulse-oximetry, electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). Logistic regression was used to evaluate association of cardiorespiratory findings with seizure characteristics and demographics.</str>
      <str>We recorded 101 seizures in 26 children (average age 3.9 years). RIP provided analyzable data in 78% and pulse-oximetry in 63% seizures. Ictal central apnea was more prevalent in patients with younger age (p = 0.01), temporal lobe (p &lt; 0.001), left-sided (p &lt; 0.01), symptomatic generalized (p = 0.01), longer duration seizures (p &lt; 0.0002), desaturation (p &lt; 0.0001), ictal bradycardia (p &lt; 0.05), and more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; p &lt; 0.01), and was less prevalent in frontal lobe seizures (p &lt; 0.01). Ictal bradypnea was more prevalent in left-sided (p &lt; 0.05), symptomatic generalized seizures (p &lt; 0.01), and in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions (p &lt; 0.1). Ictal tachypnea was more prevalent in older-age (p = 0.01), female gender (p = 0.05), frontal lobe (p &lt; 0.05), right-sided seizures (p &lt; 0.001), fewer AEDs (p &lt; 0.01), and less prevalent in lesional (p &lt; 0.05) and symptomatic generalized seizures (p &lt; 0.05). Ictal bradycardia was more prevalent in male patients (p &lt; 0.05) longer duration seizures (p &lt; 0.05), desaturation (p = 0.001), and more AEDs (p &lt; 0.05), and was less prevalent in frontal lobe seizures (p = 0.01).

      <str>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of combination of aliskiren with paricalcitol on experimental diabetic nephropathy (DN) model in rats.</str>
      <str>Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups of 8 rats each, namely the control (Group C), diabetes (Group D), aliskiren (Group A), paricalcitol (Group P), and aliskiren plus paricalcitol (Group A+P) groups. Aliskiren was given by oral-gavage at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day once daily for 12 weeks. Paricalcitol was given by intraperitoneally at a dose of 0,4 µg/kg/three day of week for 12 weeks. Renal function parameters, oxidative stress biomarkers, mRNA expression of renin-angiotensin system parameters and kidney histology were determined.</str>
      <str>Group A+P had lower mean albümin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (p=0.004) as well as higher creatinine clearance (CCr) (p&lt;0.005) than the diabetic rats (Group D). Combination therapy significantly increased CCr (Group A+P vs. Group A, p&lt;0.005; Group A+P vs. Group P, p=0.022) and reduced ACR (Group A+P vs. Group A, p=0.018; Group A+P vs. Group P, p&lt;0.005) when compared to monotherapy. Serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly lower (p=0.004); glutathion levels (p=0.003), glutathion peroxidase (p=0.004) and superoxide dismutase (p&lt;0.005) activities were significantly higher in group A+P than in group D. The mean scores of mRNA expression of renin (p&lt;0.005), angiotensin II (p=0.012) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (p=0.018) in group A+P were significantly lower. Although combination therapy showed no additional effect on oxidative system, renin-angiotensin system and renal histology, aliskiren plus paricalcitol significantly decreased interstitial fibrosis volume when compared to monotherapy (Group A+P vs. Group A, p&lt;0.005; Group A+P vs. Group P, p=0.002).</str>

      <str>The Olsen phosphorus (P) concentration of a soil is a key index that can be used to evaluate the P supply capacity of the soil and to estimate the optimal P fertilization rate. A study of the relationship between the soil Olsen P concentration and the P balance (P input minus P output) and their variations among different fertilization patterns will help to provide useful information for proper management of P fertilization. In this paper, the two investigated long-term experiments were established on black soils in the northeast region of China. Six fertilization treatments were selected: (1) unfertilized (CK); (2) nitrogen only (N); (3) nitrogen and potassium (NK); (4) nitrogen and phosphorus (NP); (5) nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK); and (6) nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and manure (NPKM). The results showed that the average Olsen P concentrations in the black soils at Gongzhuling and Harbin (16- and 31-year study periods, respectively), decreased by 0.49 and 0.56 mg kg-1 a-1, respectively, without P addition and increased by 3.17 and 1.78 mg kg-1 a-1, respectively, with P fertilization. The changes in soil Olsen P concentrations were significantly (P&lt;0.05) correlated with the P balances at both sites except for the NP and NPK treatments at Gongzhuling. Under an average deficit of 100 kg ha-1 P, the soil Olsen P concentration at both sites decreased by 1.36~3.35 mg kg-1 in the treatments without P addition and increased by 4.80~16.04 mg kg-1 in the treatments with 100 kg ha-1 of P accumulation. In addition, the changes in Olsen P concentrations in the soil with 100 kg ha-1of P balance were significantly correlated with the P activation coefficient (PAC, percentage of Olsen P to total P, r=0.99, P&lt;0.01) and soil organic matter content (r=0.91, P&lt;0.01). A low pH was related to large changes of Olsen P by 1 kg ha-1 of P balance. These results indicated that soil organic matter and pH have important effects on the change in soil Olsen P by 1 kg ha-1 of P balance. </str>

      <str>Paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation (AF) are frequently encountered in adult patients with atrial septal defect (ASD). Previously it was shown that maximum P wave duration and P wave dispersion in 12-lead surface electrocardiograms are significantly increased in individuals with a history of paroxysmal AF. The aim of this study was to determine whether P maximum and P dispersion in adult patients with ASD and without AF are increased as compared to healthy controls. In addition, the relationship of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) and these P wave indices were investigated.</str>
      <str>Sixty-two consecutive patients [39 women, 23 men; mean age 33+/-13 years (range 16 to 61 years)] with ostium secundum type ASD and 47 healthy subjects [25 women, 22 men; mean age 36.6+/-9.5 years (range 18 to 50 years)] were investigated. P maximum, P minimum and P dispersion (maximum minus minimum P wave duration) were measured from the 12-lead surface ECG. There were no significant differences with respect to age (P=0.08), gender (P=0.3), heart rate (P=0.3), left atrial diameter (P=0.5) and left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.3) between patients and controls. Pulmonary artery peak systolic pressure was significantly higher in patients with ASD as compared to controls (P&lt;0.0001). P maximum was significantly longer in patients with ASD as compared to controls (P&lt;0.0001). In addition, P dispersion of the patients was significantly higher than controls (P=0.001). P minimum was not different between groups (P=0.12). Mean Qp/Qs of the patients with ASD was 2.5+/-0.7 (minimum 1.5; maximum 4.1) and found to be significantly correlated with P maximum (r=0.34; P=0.006) and P dispersion (r=0.61; P&lt;0.0001).</str>

      <str>An experiment was conducted to determine the quantitative relationships between standardized total tract digestible P (STTD P) and total Ca intakes with their retention and excretion by growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal diets. Forty-eight crossbred barrows (BW = 22.7 ± 2.9 kg) were allotted to 1 of 8 diets, housed individually in pens for 3 wk, and then moved to metabolism crates and allowed 4 d for adaptation and 5 d for collection of urine and fecal samples. Eight corn-soybean meal diets were formulated for similar NE, fat, and AA concentrations but to increase the STTD P from 0.16 to 0.62% using monocalcium phosphate. Dietary treatments were formulated for a constant Ca:STTD P ratio (2.2:1). The STTD P intake increased ( &lt; 0.001) from 64 to 242% of the daily requirement (4.59 g/d of STTD P). Fecal and total excretion of P and Ca were linearly associated with mineral intake ( &lt; 0.001). Constant urinary P excretion of 0.03 g/d P was observed, but at 4.96 g/d of STTD P intake, the urinary P excretion increased ( &lt; 0.001). In contrast, Ca excretion in urine decreased ( &lt; 0.001) with Ca intake, but constant excretion of 0.40 g/d Ca was reached at 17.97 g/d of Ca intake. The daily intakes of STTD P and Ca moderately explained the variation in urinary excretion of P ( = 0.41) and Ca ( = 0.64). The absorption and retention of P increased linearly ( &lt; 0.001) with dietary P intake, whereas absorption and retention of Ca showed a quadratic response ( &lt; 0.001). Absorption and retention of P and Ca were highly predictable from the STTD P and Ca intakes, with of 0.87 and 0.90, respectively. The femur mineral content (FMC) increased by 2.71 g with STTD P intake ( &lt; 0.001) but reached a plateau (29.54 g of FMC) at 8.84 g/d of STTD P intake. The FMC was highly predictable from the STTD P intake ( = 0.89). The FMC affected the urinary P excretion ( &lt; 0.01), but moderately ( = 0.19) explained the variation in urinary P. In conclusion, constant excretion of P in urine was observed but excretion increased linearly at STTD P intake levels above the requirement for maximum growth of growing pigs. The FMC increased with STTD P intake, but a plateau was reached at a STTD P intake level above the requirement. Dietary STTD P was used for growth and accumulated in bones until a plateau was reached and excess was excreted in urine. The predictability of P and Ca excretion in urine from the dietary STTD P and Ca intakes was moderate. </str>

Among the 18 species, 11 belong to the P. sangirensis species group, characterized by having a pair of spermathecal pores in the intersegmental furrow of 7/8 and lacking penial sheaths in the copulatory bursae: P. maculodorsalis n. sp., P. tigris n. sp., P. immanis n. sp., P. lago n. sp., P. nunezae n. sp., P. boniaoi n. sp., P. malindangensis n. sp., P. misamisensis n. sp., P. wati n. sp., P. longiprostata n. sp., and P. nolani n. sp. One species, P. longigula n. sp., belongs to the P. montana species group, characterized by having a pair of spermathecal pores in the intersegmental furrow of 7/8 and penial sheaths in the copulatory bursae. Two species, P. vergrandis n. sp. and P. concepcionensis n. sp., are monothecal. Three species, P. adevai n. sp., P. lluchi n. sp., and P. potonganensis n. sp., belong to the P. darnleiensis species group, characterized by having either four or five pairs of spermathecae from vi to ix, with a fifth pair variably present in segment v. One species, P. subanensis n. sp., is athecate. All species described here from the Mt.

      <str>Phosphorus (P) losses to surface waters can result in eutrophication. Some industrial by-products have a strong affinity for dissolved P and may be useful in reducing nonpoint P pollution with landscape-scale runoff filters. Although appreciable research has been conducted on characterizing P sorption by industrial by-products via batch isotherms, less data are available on P sorption by these materials in a flow-through context integral to a landscape P filter. The objectives of this study were to evaluate several industrial by-products for P sorption in a flow-through setting, to determine material chemical properties that have the greatest impact on P sorption in a flow-through setting, and to explore how retention time (RT) and P concentration affect P removal. Twelve materials were characterized for chemical properties that typically influence P removal and subjected to flow-through P sorption experiments in which five different RTs and P concentrations were tested. The impact of RT and P concentrations on P removal varied based on material chemical properties, mainly as a function of oxalate-extractable aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), and water-soluble (WS) calcium (Ca). Statistical analysis showed that materials elevated in oxalate-extractable Al and Fe and WS Ca and that were highly buffered above pH 6 were able to remove the most P under flow-through conditions. Langmuir sorption maximum values from batch isotherms were poorly correlated with and overestimated P removal found under flow-through conditions. Within the conditions tested in this study, increases in RT and inflow P concentrations increased P removal among materials most likely to remove P via precipitation, whereas RT had little effect on materials likely to remove P via ligand exchange.</str>

      <str>We analyzed 30 different traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to determine levels of contamination with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). We tested for 18 pesticides: benzene hexachloride (BHC, including alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, delta-BHC), heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, tecnazene, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), hexachlorobenzene, aldrin, methyl pentachlorophenyl sulphide (MPCPS), alpha-endosulfan, trans-chlorodane, cis-chlorodane, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT. The sample extracts were analyzed by GC-ECD. A total of 280 samples of 30 different TCMs were analyzed. Our results showed that 75.8% of samples contained at least one of the above pesticides. The pesticides detected were tecnazene, hexachlorobenzene, PCNB, heptachlor, aldrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, delta-BHC, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD p,p'-DDT. More than 50% of samples contained alpha-BHC (55.8%) and PCNB (55.8%); hexachlorobenzene was detected in 40.9% of samples, tecnazene in 19.5%, gamma-BHC in 16.7% and p,p'-DDE in 16.0%. Less than 10% of samples contained beta-BHC, delta-BHC, heptachlor, aldrin, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD. None of the 280 samples contained heptachlor epoxide, MPCPS, alpha-endosulfan, trans-chlorodane, or cis-chlorodane. Concentrations of OCPs in four samples exceeded the maximum allowable residue limits (MRLs) specified in the PRC Pharmacopoeia 2005. The results indicate that the most common contaminants among the 280 samples were alpha-BHC, PCNB, hexachlorobenzene, and tecnazene. Our results suggest that contamination of TCMs with OCPs is widespread. The MRLs for other OCPs commonly found in TCMs (e.g. hexachlorobenzene and tecnazene) should be set as quickly as possible, and the MRLs of OCPs in other TCMs should be established.</str>

      <str>To examine the genetic factors influencing clozapine kinetics in vivo, 75 patients treated with clozapine were genotyped for CYPs and ABCB1 polymorphisms and phenotyped for CYP1A2 and CYP3A activity. CYP1A2 activity and dose-corrected trough steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine correlated significantly (r = -0.61; P = 1 x 10), with no influence of the CYP1A2*1F genotype (P = 0.38). CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (*2/*2 genotype) had 2.3-fold higher (P = 0.036) clozapine concentrations than the extensive metabolizers (non-*2/*2). In patients comedicated with fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, clozapine and norclozapine concentrations correlate with CYP3A activity (r = 0.44, P = 0.075; r = 0.63, P = 0.007, respectively). Carriers of the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had a 1.6-fold higher clozapine plasma concentrations than noncarriers (P = 0.046). In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time a significant in vivo role of CYP2C19 and the P-gp transporter in the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. CYP1A2 is the main CYP isoform involved in clozapine metabolism, with CYP2C19 contributing moderately, and CYP3A4 contributing only in patients with reduced CYP1A2 activity. In addition, ABCB1, but not CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, nor CYP3A7 polymorphisms, influence clozapine pharmacokinetics.</str>

      <str>In Drosophila melanogaster, hybrid dysgenesis occurs in the germline of flies produced by crosses between females lacking P elements and males carrying 25-55 P elements. We have previously shown that a complete maternally inherited repression of P transposition in the germline (P cytotype) can be elicited by only two autonomous P elements located at the X chromosome telomere (cytological site 1A). We have tested whether P transgenes at 1A, unable to code for a P-repressor, may contribute to the repression of P elements. Females carrying a P-lacZ transgene at 1A ["P-lacZ(1A)"], crossed with P males, do not repress dysgenic sterility in their progeny. However, these P-lacZ(1A) insertions, maternally or paternally inherited, contribute to P-element repression when they are combined with other regulatory P elements. This combination effect is not seen when the P-lacZ transgene is located in pericentromeric heterochromatin or in euchromatin; however a P-w,ry transgene located at the 3R chromosome telomere exhibits the combination effect. The combination effect with the P-lacZ(1A) transgene is impaired by a mutant Su(var)205 allele known to impair the repression ability of the autonomous P elements at 1A. We hypothesized that the combination effect is due to modification of the chromatin structure or nuclear location of genomic P elements.</str>

      <str>The evaluation of professional behaviors and concepts of postgraduate first-year (PGY1) residents has been identified as an area for development. This study examined the efficiency of the professionalism-assessing objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), 360° evaluation, and mini-Clinical Examination Exercise scores (mini-CEX; p-OSCE, p-360° evaluation, and p-mini-CEX scores).</str>
      <str>Between January 2009 and January 2012, 189 PGY1 residents were evaluated for behavior- and concept-based professionalism competence based on the above three methods using two checklists unique to each case. Data were analyzed for reliability, inter-rater agreement, interval changes, and gender-related difference for each method.</str>
      <str>The test reliabilities of p-OSCE, p-360° evaluation, and p-mini-CEX were acceptable. Further, the reliability of concept and combined p-OSCE was higher than that of behavior p-OSCE. In addition, the concept OSCE p-scores and behavior 360° evaluation p-scores were significantly improved after 6 months of training. The inter-rater agreements were relatively good in p-OSCE and p-360° evaluation. Interestingly, male PGY1 residents had higher behavior 360° evaluation p-scores from nurses than those of females, whereas female PGY1 residents had higher behavior 360° evaluation p-scores from patients than those of males. Behavior and concept OSCE p-scores were positively correlated with behavior 360° evaluation p-scores. In comparison with p-360° evaluation, the combination of p-360° evaluation + OSCE + mini-CEX significantly increases their reliabilities.</str>
      <str>The current study suggests that the p-OSCE, p-360° evaluation, and p-mini-CEX are feasible methods for evaluating professionalism in clinical training of PGY1 residents. Combination of the above three evaluations, participation, and support from multiple constituencies and multiple representatives provides good reliability and adds credibility in the assessment of professionalism competence.</str>

In order to evaluate relations between hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial and leukocyte function, the investigators related homocysteine to indices of endothelial function (plasma endothelin-1 [p-ET-1] and intraplatelet levels of the nitric oxide [NO] and prostacyclin mediators 3'-5' guanosine monophosphate [cGMP] and cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]) and the monocyte-derived inflammatory mediator neopterin in 168 men (mean age 69, range 49-72 years) with disturbed glucose metabolism and a reference group of 52 male subjects (mean age 70, range 61-79 years). Among the 168 patients with disturbed glucose metabolism plasma (p)-homocysteine correlated significantly with age (r=0.20; p&lt;0.01), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r=0.17; p&lt;0.05), triglycerides (r=0.20; p&lt;0.05), intraplatelet GMP (r=0.16; p&lt;0.05), p-ET-1 (r=0.21; p&lt;0.05), and p-neopterin (r=0.31; p&lt;0.001). The correlation between p-homocysteine and p-ET-1 persisted (p&lt;0.01) in multiple regression analysis. Among the 52 reference subjects p-homocysteine correlated significantly with p-ET-1 (r=0.32; p&lt;0.05) and p-neopterin (r=0.37; p&lt;0.01). The correlation between p-homocysteine and p-neopterin persisted (p&lt;0.05) in multiple regression analysis. In conclusion, homocysteine is related to neopterin and endothelin-1 in plasma of subjects with disturbed glucose metabolism and in reference subjects, suggesting that homocysteine exerts its deleterious effects on vascular function through interference with endothelial and leukocyte function.</str>

      <str>P-selectin variant 715Pro is associated with lower concentrations of plasma P-selectin and reduced risk for thrombosis. We examined the influence of 715Pro on P-selectin synthesis, post-translational processing, surface expression and function using HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous P-selectin. Mass spectrometry revealed that HEK293 cells produced recombinant P-selectin which has a glycosylation pattern comparable to platelet P-selectin. Compared to wild-type transfectants, 715Pro transfectants have ~50% less terminally glycosylated P-selectin and accumulate more immature P-selectin in Golgi. Following Brefeldin A treatment, the majority of 715Pro P-selectin is not modified by Golgi enzymes, while wild-type P-selectin undergoes complete modification. Flow cytometry revealed that 715Pro transfectants have ~20% less P-selectin on the cell surface compared to wild-type transfectants. Secretion of P-selectin by 715Pro transfectants was about 38% lower compared to wild-type transfectants. Binding of HL-60 cells to 715Pro transfectants was ~29% lower than to wild-type transfectants. This observation was confirmed by the presence of fewer platelet-monocyte aggregates (PMA) in the blood of healthy individuals and patients with angiographically proven atherosclerosis, carrying 715Pro P-selectin compared to individuals with wild-type P-selectin. We conclude that the 715Pro variant impairs terminal glycosylation of P-selectin in Golgi, leading to reduced amounts of mature P-selectin and subsequently less surface expression and secretion of P-selectin. The reduced surface expression of 715Pro P-selectin contributes to inefficient adhesion to HL-60 cells or monocytes.</str>

      <str>Recent studies showed that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increases the portal bioavailability (FG) of loperamide by sparing its intestinal first-pass metabolism. Loperamide is a drug whose oral absorption is strongly attenuated by intestinal P-gp-mediated efflux and first-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Here the effect of the interplay of P-gp and Cyp3a in modulating intestinal first-pass metabolism and absorption was investigated for another Cyp3a/P-gp dual substrate amprenavir, which is less efficiently effluxed by P-gp than loperamide. After oral administration of amprenavir, the portal concentrations and FG of amprenavir were approximately equal in P-gp competent and P-gp deficient mice. Mechanistic studies on the effect of P-gp on Cyp3a-mediated metabolism of amprenavir using intestinal tissue from P-gp competent and P-gp deficient mice (Ussing-type diffusion chamber) revealed that P-gp-mediated efflux caused only a slight reduction of oxidative metabolism of amprenavir. Studies in which portal concentrations and FG were measured in P-gp competent and P-gp deficient mice whose cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes were either intact or inactivated showed that intestinal first-pass metabolism attenuates the oral absorption of amprenavir by approximately 10-fold, whereas P-gp efflux has a relatively small effect (approximately 2-fold) in attenuating the intestinal absorption. Cumulatively, these studies demonstrate that P-gp has little influence on the intestinal first-pass metabolism and FG of amprenavir and that intestinal P450-mediated metabolism plays the dominant role in attenuating the oral absorption of this drug.</str>

      <str>1,1-Dichloro-2,2 bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the major metabolite of 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT), is a known persistent organic pollutant and male reproductive toxicant. It has antiandrogenic effect. However, the mechanism by which p,p'-DDE exposure causes male reproductive toxicity remains unknown. To elucidate the mechanism underpinning the testicular effects of p,p'-DDE, we sought to investigate Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway in the testis of prepubertal rats, including Fas, FasL, caspase-8, -3, and NF-kappaB. Animals were administered with different doses of p,p'-DDE (0, 20, 60, 100mg/kg b.wt) every other day by intraperitoneal injection for 10 days. The results indicated that p,p'-DDE exposure at over 20mg/kg b.wt showed the induction of apoptotic cell death. p,p'-DDE could induce increase in the MDA level, and decrease in SOD and GSH-Px activity. Significant elevations in the mRNA levels of Fas along with an increase in FasL, caspase-3, -8 were observed in 100mg/kg b.wt group. In protein level, p,p'-DDE could induce increase of FasL and reduction of procaspase-8. NF-kappaB p65 was activated by p,p'-DDE treatment in rat testis. In addition, the activities of caspase-3, -8 were increased in 100mg/kg b.wt group. Taken together, these results lead us to speculate that in vivo exposure to p,p'-DDE might induce testicular apoptosis in prepubertal rats through the Fas/FasL pathway.</str>

      <str>We evaluated impact of DDT isomers, o, p'- DDT [1, 1-dichloro-2, 2-bis (p, p'-chlorophenyl) ethylene] and p, p'-DDT [1, 1, 1-trichloro-2, 2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane], and their metabolites, o, p'-DDE and p, p'-DDE, on ovarian steroidogenesis. All these compounds, except for p, p'-DDT, demonstrated estrogenic effects on steroid secretion in co-cultures of porcine prepubertal granulosa and theca cells. p,p'-DDT decreased progesterone and estradiol release, which was reversed by the addition of testosterone. In contrast, o, p'-DDT inhibited progesterone secretion with parallel stimulation of basal and testosterone-stimulated estradiol release. DDEs stimulated progesterone and estradiol secretion. The fluorometric assay confirmed that p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, and o,p'-DDE stimulated aromatase activity. Western blots indicated that o,p-DDT and o,p'-DDE diminished the expression of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta). This study demonstrated the isomer-dependent action of DDT in pig ovarian cells. We propose that DDT could disrupt ovarian steroidogenesis either by interfering with main steroidogenic enzymes or affecting ERbeta.</str>

      <str>P-wave dispersion, an electrocardiographic marker, is an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation. P-wave dispersion is associated with inhomogeneous and discontinuous propagation of sinus impulses. The aim of this study was to investigate P-wave dispersion in students who apply for registration to School of Physical Education and Sports.</str>
      <str>Totally 984 students (810 boys [mean age: 19.8 +/- 2.0 years] and 174 girls [mean age: 19.0 +/- 1.8 years]) who applied for registration to School of Physical Education and Sports with a training history of some years were included in the study. P-wave duration was calculated in all 12 leads of the surface electrocardiography, which were simultaneously recorded. The difference between P maximum and P minimum durations was defined as P-wave dispersion.</str>
      <str>Age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, P-wave maximal duration, and P-wave dispersion were increased in boys as compared with girls.

      <str>Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is a determinant of impaired coronary function and oestrogens inhibit its formation probably throughout genetically-variable oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in artery wall. We hypothesized that the ESR1 polymorphism might influence coronary function and reactivity as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which allows the detection of coronary dysfunction before appearance of angiographic lesions.</str>
      <str>Fifty-one healthy young men (aged 35 +/- 4 years), with normal or slightly-elevated serum cholesterol, underwent PET with intravenous adenosine. ESR1 PvuII genotypes P/P, P/p, and p/p in addition to the plasma autoantibody titre against ox-LDL, a marker of in vivo oxidation, were determined.</str>
      <str>The ESR1 genotype persisted as the only significant predictor of adenosine stimulated coronary flow (P = 0.035) after adjustment for other coronary risk factors. Subjects with P/P genotype had 33.4 and 41.8% lower adenosine-stimulated flow values than subjects with P/p and p/p genotypes (P = 0.030). Furthermore, plasma levels of ox-LDL titre were on average 59 and 77% higher in subjects with P/P genotype than in subjects with P/p or p/p genotypes (P = 0.049).</str>
      <str>These tentative findings from our pilot study provide evidence that genetic variation in ESR1 may modify coronary reactivity and LDL oxidation and reflect differences in the early pathogenesis of coronary dysfunction in these healthy young men.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of obesity on dynamic plantar pressure distribution during walking for prepubescent children. A footscan(®) plantar pressure plate system was used to collect the gait data. Fifty obese prepubescent children and fifty non-obese prepubescent children walked across the plate at preferred speed while barefoot. SPSS11.5 was used for analysis and significance is defined as p&lt;0.05. Obese subjects had longer midstance duration (p=0.004) and shorter propulsion duration (p=0.047) compared to non-obese subjects. The peak pressures under the metatarsal heads II-V, midfoot and heel lateral (p=0.004, p=0.03, p=0.004) were significantly higher for obese subjects. The time to peak pressures under the toes II-V, the metatarsal heads IV, V and midfoot (p=0.008, p=0.009, p=0.01, p=0.006), and pressure rate under the heel medial and lateral heel (p=0.03, p=0.009) were also significantly higher. In addition, the arch index for the left foot (p=0.01), the left and right foot axis angle (p=0.027, p=0.03) were significant larger among obese subjects. We also found that obese subjects had significantly higher relative regional impulses of contact with the plate at the midfoot of left foot (p=0.01) and the forefoot of right foot (p=0.047). There were also differences in foot balance during the midstance and propulsion phase (p=0.0004, p=0.03) and in pronation extent during midstance and propulsion phases between left and right foot in the obese group (p=0.03, p=0.01). In conclusion, the obese children have weaker walking stability with flatter foot pattern, the larger foot axis angle and dynamic plantar pressure distribution changes compared to non-obese children.</str>

      <str>Nonpoint-source pollution by phosphorus (P) poses a threat to waters in the Taihu Lake basin in China. The potential transfer of P in rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields through surface drainage and subsurface flow was investigated under simulated conventional irrigation-drainage management. Surface drainage events were conducted to avoid overflow across the plots after heavy rainfall and for rice harvest, at which time P losses were also investigated. This study was conducted in 2001 in a long-term rice field experiment. The experimental plots were treated with 0, 26, or 52 kg P ha(-1) as superphosphate or 26 kg P ha(-1) with equal parts of P supplied as superphosphate and pig manure. Phosphorus concentrations and loads in field floodwater on plots receiving P rapidly declined in a nonlinear manner before the first drainage, three weeks after fertilizer application. The combined application of fertilizer and manure P resulted in higher P transfer potential in field floodwater than with fertilizer P alone one week after P application. Phosphorus concentrations in interflow water sampled by Teflon suction cups inserted at a depth of 150 to 200 mm gradually increased within two weeks after P application, then declined. The concentration of P in interflow water was related to soil P buildup from long-term P application, as well as recently applied P. The 26 kg P ha(-1) treatment (the conventional P rate in this region) resulted in a loss of 0.74 kg total phosphorus (TP) ha(-1) and a drainage-weighted average concentration of 0.25 mg TP L(-1) from the three surface drainage events. Results indicate that avoiding overflow drainage after P input and extending the time between P application and drainage may reduce P losses from rice paddies.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a transmembrane efflux transporter which possesses many important functions in drug absorption, disposition, metabolism, and toxicity. The ultimate goal of investigating drug interactions between P-gp and drug molecules in early drug discovery is to understand the contribution of P-gp to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drug candidates and to project drug-drug interaction (DDI) potentials in humans. Understanding species differences in P-gp activities further helps the prediction of P-gp-mediated drug disposition and DDI in humans from preclinical pharmacokinetics data. The objective of the present study is to investigate the species difference in P-gp activities, via P-gp ATPase assays, using rhesus monkey Mdr1, beagle dog Mdr1, and human MDR1 expressed insect cell membranes. Twenty-one compounds with diverse chemical structures and different P-gp binding sites were chosen for the ATPase assays. P-gp ATPase binding affinities (alphaKa) and fold increases in P-gp ATPase activities (beta) of P-gp substrates were determined. Consistent with the gene and amino acid similarity, the binding affinities of test compounds to rhesus monkey P-gp were much closer to those of human P-gp than beagle dog P-gp. This is the first study which investigates the ligand affinities of P-gp from three different species. The result of this study provides an example of how to use membrane P-gp ATPase assays to evaluate interspecies P-gp differences.</str>

      <str>We have previously described two Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes, ptxR, which enhances toxA and pvc (the pyoverdine chromophore operon) expression, and ptxS, the first gene of the kgu operon for the utilization of 2-ketogluconate by P. aeruginosa. ptxS interferes with the effect of ptxR on toxA expression. In this study, we have utilized DNA hybridization experiments to determine the presence of ptxR and ptxS homologous sequences in several gram-negative bacteria. ptxR homologous sequences were detected in P. aeruginosa strains only, while ptxS homologous sequences were detected in P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Using Northern blot hybridization experiments and a ptxS-lacZ fusion plasmid, we have shown that P. aeruginosa ptxR and ptxS are expressed in P. putida and P. fluorescens. Additional Northern blot hybridization experiments confirmed that ptxS is transcribed in P. putida and P. fluorescens strains that carried no plasmid. The presence of a PtxS homologue in these strains was examined by DNA-gel shift experiments. Specific gel shift bands were detected when the lysates of P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens were incubated with the ptxS operator site as probe. kgu-hybridizing sequences were detected in P. putida and P. fluorescens. These results suggest that (i) ptxR is present in P. aeruginosa, while ptxS is present in P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens; (ii) both ptxR and ptxS are expressed in P. putida and P fluorescens; and (iii) a PtxS homologue may exist in P. putida and P. fluorescens.</str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to determine by univariate and multivariate analyses the factors associated with clinically significant anastomotic leakage (AL) after large bowel resection. From 1990 to 1997 a series of 707 patients underwent colonic or rectal resection (without a stoma). Patients were divided into two groups: those with clinical anastomotic leakage (group 1) and those without it (group 2). AL occurred in 43 of 707 patients (6%). The overall mortality was 2.2% and was significantly higher in patients with AL than in those without: 5 of 43 (12%) versus 11 of 664 (1.6%), p &lt; 0.001. Univariate analysis showed 15 variables associated with the risk of AL: previous abdominal or pelvic irradiation (p = 0.02), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score &gt; 2 (p = 0.04), leukocytosis (p = 0.02), renal failure (p = 0.03), steroid treatment (p = 0.01), duration of operation (p = 0.001), intraoperative septic conditions (p = 0.006), total colectomy (p = 0.009), transverse colectomy (p = 0.02), difficulties encountered during anastomosis (p = 0.001), ileorectal anastomosis (p = 0.02), colocolic anastomosis (p = 0.01), abdominal drainage (p = 0.05), and blood transfusion intraoperatively (p = 0.006) and postoperatively (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that only preoperative leukocytosis (p = 0.04), intraoperative septic conditions (p = 0.001), difficulties encountered during anastomosis (p = 0.007), colocolic anastomosis (p = 0.004), and postoperative blood transfusion (p = 0.0007) were independent factors associated with AL. The risk of AL increased from a range of 12% to 30% if one risk factor was present, to 38% with two factors, to 50% with three factors. After colorectal resection and intraperitoneal anastomosis, a temporary protective stoma is proposed in selected patients with high risk factors for AL, as observed in our study.</str>

      <str>Platelet activation in preeclampsia is reflected by elevated levels of platelets exposing P-selectin. In plasma, a non-cell bound (soluble) form of P-selectin is present. Elevated levels of this soluble form have been reported in preeclampsia. Plasma P-selectin may consist of two fractions: microparticle (MP)--associated P-selectin and non-MP--associated P-selectin. In the present cross-sectional study, we investigated to which extent plasma P-selectin is MP--associated and whether such MP are elevated in preeclamptic patients. Preeclamptic patients (n=10) were matched with normotensive pregnant women (n=10) and non-pregnant controls (n=10). Plasma P-selectin was measured by ELISA. MP were isolated, double labelled with anti-CD61 (GPIIIa) and anti-CD62P (P-selectin) and subsequently analyzed with flowcytometry. Plasma P-selectin concentration was elevated in preeclamptic patients compared to non-pregnant controls (p=0.007), but not compared to normotensive pregnant women (p=0.210). Plasma P-selectin is partially MP--associated (3-5%). In pregnancy, the fraction of P-selectin exposing platelet-derived MP (PMP) (10.9%) was increased compared to non-pregnant controls (8%). This fraction further increased in preeclamptic patients (15.4%), and significantly differed from normotensive pregnant women (p=0.02). A minor fraction of plasma P-selectin is associated with PMP. The fraction of PMP exposing P-selectin is increased in preeclamptic patients and to a lesser extent in normotensive pregnancy. Because MP associated P-selectin exclusively originates from platelets, this fraction indicates platelet activation. Platelet activation is prominent in preeclampsia and this study proves that at least a part of the plasma P-selectin originates from platelets.</str>

      <str>We examined developmental changes in breathing pattern and the ventilatory response to hypoxia (7.4% O(2)) in unanesthetized Swiss CD-1 mice ranging in age from postnatal day 0 to 42 (P(0)-P(42)) using head-out plethysmography. The breathing pattern of P(0) mice was unstable. Apneas were frequent at P(0) (occupying 29 +/- 6% of total time) but rare by P(3) (5 +/- 2% of total time). Tidal volume increased in proportion to body mass ( approximately 10-13 ml/kg), but increases in respiratory frequency (f) (55 +/- 7, 130 +/- 13, and 207 +/- 20 cycles/min for P(0), P(3), and P(42), respectively) were responsible for developmental increases in minute ventilation (690 +/- 90, 1,530 +/- 250, and 2,170 +/- 430 ml. min(-1). kg(-1) for P(0), P(3), and P(42), respectively). Between P(0) and P(3), increases in f were mediated by reductions in apnea and inspiratory and expiratory times; beyond P(3), increases were due to reductions in expiratory time. Mice of all ages showed a biphasic hypoxic ventilatory response, which differed in two respects from the response typical of most mammals. First, the initial hyperpnea, which was greatest in mature animals, decreased developmentally from a maximum, relative to control, of 2.58 +/- 0.29 in P(0) mice to 1. 32 +/- 0.09 in P(42) mice. Second, whereas ventilation typically falls to or below control in most neonatal mammals, ventilation remained elevated relative to control throughout the hypoxic exposure in P(0) (1.73 +/- 0.31), P(3) (1.64 +/- 0.29), and P(9) (1. 34 +/- 0.17) mice but not in P(19) or P(42) mice.</str>

      <str>The direct costs for patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy during the learning curve (group A) and after the attainment of proficiency by two colorectal surgeons performing the procedure (group B) between 2001 and 2007 were compared. The learning curve was defined as the first 40 laparoscopic colectomy cases for each surgeon. The distribution of cases for the surgeons ensured that cost-related differences were not influenced by lead time bias of cases performed during the learning curve.</str>
      <str>The study involved 80 group A and 74 group B patients. Groups A and B were similar in terms of age (P = 0.7), gender (P = 0.5), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (P = 0.5), body mass index (P = 0.3), diagnosis (P = 0.8), previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.07), and comorbidity (P = 0.4). The two groups also were similar with regard to performance of anastomosis (P = 0.2) or resection (P = 0.6), conversion to open surgery (P = 0.7), postoperative morbidity (P = 0.6), readmission (P = 0.1), reoperation rate (P = 0.6), and hospital length of stay (P = 0.6). The operation time was significantly longer for group A (P = 0.01). The total direct costs (P = 0.7) and the operating room (P = 0.6), nursing (P = 0.7), pharmacy (P = 0.9), radiology (P = 1), and professional (P = 0.051) costs were however similar between the two groups.</str>
      <str>As expected, laparoscopic colectomy during the learning curve period is associated with prolonged operating time. Concerns pertaining to increased conversions, complications, and direct costs during this period were not substantiated in this study.</str>

      <str>Recent trials have suggested an adverse early effect on cardiovascular risk of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women, an effect which could be due to an increase in arterial thrombosis via platelet activation. We examined the effect of HT on platelet surface expression of P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, and plasma levels of soluble P-selectin, also believed to be a marker of platelet activation, and compared these effects with pravastatin, a drug proven to reduce cardiovascular events and reported to decrease both platelet and soluble P-selectin.</str>
      <str>Surface expression of platelet P-selectin, soluble P-selectin and fasting lipids were measured at baseline and 6 months in a randomized, double-blind study of postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women comparing low-dose combined HT (1mg estradiol + 0.5 mg norethisterone acetate; n = 26) with pravastatin (n = 24).</str>
      <str>After adjusting for baseline levels, HT and pravastatin produced similar reductions in soluble P-selectin (p &lt; 0.0001 for both). The percentage of platelets expressing P-selectin was also reduced by pravastatin (p = 0.025), but there was a trend to an increase in platelet P-selectin expression with HT (p = 0.13), and a significant difference between pravastatin and HT in the changes in platelet P-selectin (p &lt; 0.002). No relationship was evident between changes in soluble or platelet P-selectin and changes in lipids with either treatment.</str>
      <str>In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, both pravastatin and HT reduced soluble P-selectin levels, but only pravastatin reduced P-selectin expression on the surface of platelets. An implication of these findings is that the reduction in soluble P-selectin by HT may occur by a non-platelet related mechanism.</str>

      <str>The transport of inorganic phosphate (P) was measured in the absence of electrochemical gradients across rat jejunum in vitro. Active P absorption was demonstrated in young, vitamin D-deficient (-D) rats, whereas active P secretion was found in normal, non-vitamin D-deficient adult rats, suggesting regulation of intestinal P transport by age-dependent but vitamin D-independent mechanisms. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] stimulated mucosal-to-serosal P flux (Jm----s) without affecting serosal-to-mucosal P flux (Js----m), causing further increases in net P absorption (Jnet) in -D rats and reduction in net P secretion in normal adult rats, confirming a previously described role of this hormone on P absorption. We then examined the effect of increasing extracellular (buffer) P concentration [P] on this 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated active P absorption in jejunum from -D rats. At [P] of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mM, 1,25(OH)2D3 consistently stimulated Jm----s without affecting Js----m, causing an increment in Jnet. At 7.5 mM [P], however, this Jm----s stimulatory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was no longer observed. Moreover, at this [P] the Js----m exceeded Jm----s in both -D and 1,25(OH)2D3-repleted rats, converting the active P absorption into active P secretion in both treatment groups. These observations suggest the participation of local mechanisms, such as the ambient [P] of the transporting enterocytes, in the regulation of intestinal P absorption. Finally, the influence of dietary P deprivation on P absorption was studied in -D rats, with or without either vitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3 repletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>We hypothesized that intermittent hypoxia might influence serum substance P levels, and that this effect might in turn contribute in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).</str>
      <str>Fifty-five patients with newly diagnosed OSAS and 15 age-matched nonapneic control subjects were enrolled in this study. Full polysomnography was performed in all patients. Single blood samples were drawn between 8:00 am and 9:00 am after the sleep study. Substance P levels were analyzed with a competitive enzyme immunoassay (substance P EIA kit; Cayman Chemical; Ann Arbor, MI).</str>
      <str>There were no significant differences in age, gender, body mass index, smoking habit, and snoring between the two groups. Serum substance P levels in the OSAS group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.0001). Serum substance P levels were positively correlated with rapid eye movement sleep (r = 0.330, p = 0.049) and slow-wave sleep (r = 0.324, p = 0.049) phases. Serum substance P levels were negatively correlated with Epworth sleepiness scale score (r = - 0.253, p = 0.048), number of total apneas during the night (r = - 0.247, p = 0.036), number of respiratory events during the night (r = - 0.266, p = 0.024), apnea-hypopnea index (r = - 0.287, p = 0.015), respiratory arousal index (r = - 0.267, p = 0.026), time spent in apnea and hypopnea (r = - 0.307, p = 0.01), average oxygen desaturation (r = - 0.265, p = 0.026), and oxygen desaturation index (r = - 0.254, p = 0.031).</str>
      <str>We concluded that EDS seen in some of the OSAS patients might be associated with various pathophysiologic mechanisms including substance P levels.</str>

      <str>Elevated levels of P in urban streams can pose significant water quality problems. Sources of P in urban streams, however, are difficult to identify. It is important to recognize both natural and anthropogenic sources of P. We investigated near-stream chemistry and land use factors on stream water P in the urbanizing Johnson Creek watershed in Portland, OR, USA. We sampled stream water and shallow groundwater soluble reactive P (SRP) and total P (TP) and estimated P flux at 13 sites along the main stem of Johnson Creek, with eight sites in urban land use areas and five sites in nonurban land use areas. At each site, we sampled the A and B horizons, measuring soil pH, water-soluble P, acid-soluble P, base-soluble P, total P, Fe, and Al. We found continuous input of P to the stream water via shallow groundwater throughout the Johnson Creek watershed. The shallow groundwater P concentrations were correlated with stream water P within the nonurban area; however, this correlation was not found in the urban area, suggesting that other factors in the urban area masked the relationship between groundwater P and stream water P. Aluminum and Fe concentrations were inversely correlated with shallow groundwater P, suggesting that greater P adsorption to Al and Fe oxides in the nonurban area reduced availability of shallow groundwater P. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, however, we concluded that while riparian soil chemistry was related to stream water P, land use patterns had a more significant relationship with stream water P concentrations in this urbanizing system.</str>

      <str>Propionibacterium acnes belongs to the cutaneous flora and is present in sebaceous follicles. The fatty acids that are released from sebum triglycerides by the action of this bacterial lipase play an important role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. P. acnes is also involved in postoperative disorders and opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed hosts. Recently, it has been proposed that P. acnes causes sarcoidosis. Therefore, rapid isolation and identification of P. acnes is important. This study evaluated the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of the 16S rRNA and lipase genes of P. acnes. The PCR used to detect the 16S rRNA gene could amplify the gene of P. acnes, but not the genes of the other tested strains of P. avidum, P. granulosum, P. lymphophilum, P. jensenii, P. acidipropionici and P. thoenii. The PCR to detect the lipase gene of P. acnes, however, could amplify not only the gene of P. acnes but also that of P. avidum. The PCR product of this lipase gene was not found in the strains of the other species tested. Therefore, the organism that has both the 16S rRNA gene and lipase gene was identified as P. acnes, while the strain with the lipase gene but not the 16S rRNA gene of P. acnes was characterized as P. avidum. These findings were confirmed by the conventional biochemical tests including lipase activity. Furthermore, out of the seven clinical isolates from acne vulgaris, four were identified as P. acnes and three as P. avidum by the PCR method and biochemical tests. The combination of two PCR, one for the detection of the 16S rRNA and the other of lipase genes was shown to be an easier, faster and more accurate method to identify P. acnes and P. avidum than conventional methods.</str>

      <str>In this report we provide data, for the first time, demonstrating the conversion of the heme moiety of certain cytochrome P-450 and P-420 preparations, to biliverdin, catalyzed by heme oxygenase. We have used purified preparations of cytochromes P-450c, P-450b, P-450/P-420c, or P-450/P-420b as substrates in a heme oxygenase assay system reconstituted with heme oxygenase isoforms, HO-2 or HO-1, NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase, biliverdin reductase, NADPH, and Emulgen 911. With cytochrome P-450b or P-450/P-420b preparations, a near quantitative conversion of degraded heme to bile pigments was observed. In the case of cytochrome P-450/P-420c approximately 70% of the degraded heme was accounted for as bilirubin but only cytochrome P-420c was appreciably degraded. The role of heme oxygenase in this reaction was supported by the following observations: (i) bilirubin formation was not observed when heme oxygenase was omitted from the assay system; (ii) the rate of degradation of the heme moiety was at least threefold greater with heme oxygenase and NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase than that observed with reductase alone; and (iii) the presence of Zn- or Sn-protoporphyrins (2 microM), known competitive inhibitors of heme oxygenase, resulted in 70-90% inhibition of bilirubin formation.</str>

      <str>Large-scale production of ³²P for its clinical use in palliative care of painful bone metastasis in the form of Na3[³²P]PO₄ (³²P-sodium orthophosphate) has been practiced for six decades. The classical route of production of ³²P by (n,p) reaction on high purity elemental sulfur yields no-carrier-added (NCA) ³²P. Since high specific activity ³²P is not essential for the formulation of Na₃[³²P]PO₄ for bone pain palliation, an alternate route of production of ³²P by direct neutron capture using elemental phosphorus target [(31)P(n,γ)³²P] was envisaged and its suitability for use in bone pain palliation was evaluated. Toward this, irradiation of elemental red phosphorus target was carried out at a neutron flux of 8×10¹³ n/cm².s for 60 days and this yielded ³²P with a specific activity of 230±15 MBq/mg (6.2±0.4 mCi/mg) having &gt;99.9% radionuclidic purity. About 370-555 MBq (10-15 mCi) doses of Na₃[³²P]PO₄ were formulated in sterile saline (pH 7.4) using the ³²P produced. The radiochemical purity of the formulation was found to be ~99% with respect to PO₄³⁻. The formulation exhibited good in vitro stability in saline and in human serum. Biodistribution studies carried out in normal Wistar rats revealed comparable pharmacokinetic properties of the formulation prepared using (n,γ) produced ³²P with that of NCA ³²P produced by (n,p) route. Besides having the advantages of simplicity in radiochemical processing and minimum radioactive waste generation, use of the proposed production route in place of the traditional ³²S(n,p)³²P route would result in better utilization of irradiation volume of research reactors.</str>

      <str>We tested the hypothesis that surgeon fatigue results in worse outcomes for laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy by comparing outcomes of sequentially scheduled procedures.</str>
      <str>We identified days when 2 procedures of the same type were performed by the same surgeon, including 72 laparoscopic and 340 robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies, and 110 percutaneous nephrolithotomies. Clinical data and outcomes were compared.</str>
      <str>For percutaneous nephrolithotomy multiple access (16% vs 9%, p = 0.2), transfusion (3.6% vs 5.4%, p = 0.5), complication (20% vs 18%, p = 0.5), residual fragment (53% vs 45%, p = 0.3), second look (38% vs 35% p = 0.4) and stone-free (86% vs 89% p = 0.3) rates did not differ for the first and second procedures. For laparoscopic prostatectomy nerve sparing (100% vs 97.1%, p = 0.5), operative complications (0% vs 0%, p = 0.7), drain requirement (36% vs 42%, p = 0.6) and lymphadenectomy (13.5% vs 25.7%, p = 0.16) rates were comparable. Positive margins (19.4% vs 36.1% p = 0.08), continence (66.7% vs 66.7%, p = 0.9), potency (58.3% vs 52.8%, p = 0.76) and prostate specific antigen recurrence (10.8% vs 20%, p = 0.45) did not significantly differ for the first and second procedures. For robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy operative complications (3% vs 3.5%, p = 0.8), drain requirement (7.7% vs 9.8%, p = 0.5), positive margins (41.7% vs 39.3%, p = 0.37), continence (78.6% vs 84.4%, p = 0.12), potency (51% vs 50%, p = 0.15) and prostate specific antigen recurrence (9.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.2) did not significantly differ.

      <str>By sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA or genomic DNA, we have recently deduced the complete primary structures of two forms of 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochromes P-450 (P-450c and P-450d). Comparing these sequences, we identified two highly conserved regions, amino acid numbers from 35 to 200 and from 340 to 470. The nucleotide sequences corresponding to these homologous regions are also well conserved, whereas other regions have undergone considerable sequence divergence. In RNA blot analysis with unfractionated mRNA isolated from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rat livers, Probe A (specific to P-450c sequence) hybridized with mRNA around 23 S, while Probe B (specific to P-450d sequence) hybridized with mRNA around 18 S. When common sequence between P-450c and P-450d was used as the probes (Probe C or D), two bands were clearly observed around 23 and 18 S mRNAs. With the common DNA sequence between P-450c and P-450d as a probe (93.7% homology), we studied the induction of specific mRNA for P-450c and P-450d by a single dose of several chemical compounds to rats. 3-Methylcholanthrene increased both P-450c and P-450d mRNA levels by 50 and 10 times above the control at 17 h after the administration, respectively. Despite the lower induction rates, the P-450d mRNA level was constantly higher than or at least similar to that of P-450c mRNA. beta-Naphthoflavone and Kaneclor KC 500 showed similar induction ability to 3-methylcholanthrene. On the other hand, isosafrole induced P-450d mRNA to a much greater extent than P-450c mRNA.</str>

      <str>In most populations, gastric cancer (GC) incidence is higher in men than in women, which may suggest the role of sex steroid hormones in gastric cancerogenesis. Both, androgens and estrogens can be synthetised in peripherial tissues. This process is controlled by expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Therefore, we evaluate the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD17B2) transcript and protein levels in gastric tumoral and nontumoral tissue. We also determined the association between HSD17B2 transcript and protein levels and some clinicopathological features in GC. We found significantly decreased levels of HSD17B2 transcript (P=0.00072) and protein (P=0.00017) in primary tumoral tissues of GC patients, as compared to nontumoral tissues. In patients above 60years of age the amounts of HSD17B2 transcript (P=0.00044) and protein (P=0.00027) were significantly lower in tumoral than nontumoral tissues. Similarly, lower HSD17B2 levels, both in terms of the transcript and protein, were observed in tumoral tissues of male (P=0.013, P=0.0014), patients stomach (P=0.0062, P=0.045) and cardia (P=0.02, P=0.02) site of tumor, T3 (P=0.018, P=0.014) depth of invasion, N0 (P=0.017, P=0.045) lymph node metastasis, G3 (P=0.0027, P=0.014) malignancy grade. We also observed significantly reduced level of HSD17B2 transcript in tumoral tissue specimens of females (P=0.014), T4 depth of invasion (P=0.02), N3 lymph node metastasis (P=0.037) and G2 malignancy grade (P=0.045). Furthermore, diffuse GC histological types were associated with lower HSD17B2 protein level (P=0.024) than nontumoral tissues. We demonstrated that HSD17B2 transcript and protein levels are linked to some clinicopathological features in GC. </str>

The poorly binding to nDer p 3 or rDer p 3 was due to autolysis of the allergen. Contrary to Der p 3, proDer p 3 displayed very weak IgE reactivity, as measured by sandwich ELISA and competitive inhibition, rat basophil leukaemia degranulation and human basophil activation assays.

      <str>Serum copper, zinc and selenium were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry in 189 healthy subjects. Serum glutathione peroxidase and caeruloplasmin were also determined for each subject. A previously validated food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate the dietary trace element intake.</str>
      <str>Male subjects had significantly lower serum copper (P&lt;0.001) and caeruloplasmin (P&lt;0.001), and higher serum zinc (P&lt;0.05) and zinc:copper ratio (P&lt;0.001) than female subjects. Significant differences were observed in serum copper and caeruloplasmin concentrations (P&lt;0.01) with age. Weak but significant associations between dietary trace elements and their serum concentrations were observed for zinc (r=0.18, P=0.02), copper (r=0.17, P=0.03) and selenium (r=0.19, P=0.02).

      <str>The metabolism of lidocaine by human hepatic microsomes and purified human cytochrome P-450s, P-450NF (P450IIIA4), P-450MP (a P450IIC form) and P-450PA (P450IA2) was examined and their metabolism was compared with that by rat hepatic cytochrome P-450s. Human hepatic microsomes produced monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and 3-hydroxylidocaine (3-OH-LID) from lidocaine. In a reconstituted system with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, P-450NF efficiently produced MEGX. P-450PA was not efficient in lidocaine N-deethylation (formation of MEGX) but produced 3-OH-LID. P-450NF and P-450MP did not produce 3-OH-LID. Lidocaine N-deethylation activity of P-450NF was enhanced in a modified reconstituted system with a phospholipid mixture and sodium cholate. P-450NF appears to be an ortholog to rat P450 PB-1 (P450IIIA2). Anti-P450 PB-1 antibody cross-reacted with P-450NF and efficiently inhibited lidocaine N-deethylation in human hepatic microsomes. The correlation of lidocaine N-deethylation activity with the concentration of P-450NF determined immunochemically with anti-P450 PB-1 antibody was good (r = 0.81). In addition, correlation between P-450NF content estimated with anti-P450 PB-1 and anti-P-450NF preparations was good (r = 0.96). These results suggest that rat P450 PB-1 and human P-450NF have closely related properties and P-450NF is the major enzyme involved in lidocaine N-deethylation in human hepatic microsomes.</str>

      <str>To investigate construct validity for modules hydromaneuvers and phaco on the Eyesi surgical simulator.</str>
      <str>Seven cataract surgeons and 17 medical students performed capsulorhexis, hydromaneuvers, phaco, navigation, forceps, cracking and chopping modules in a standardized manner. Three trials were performed on each module (two on phaco) in the above order. Performance parameters as calculated by the simulator for each trial were saved. Video recordings of the second trial of the modules capsulorhexis, hydromaneuvers and phaco were evaluated with the modified Objective Structured Assessment of Surgical Skill (OSATS) and Objective Structured Assessment of Cataract Surgical Skill (OSACSS) tools.</str>
      <str>Cataract surgeons outperformed medical students with regard to overall score on capsulorhexis (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.010 for the tree iterations, respectively), navigation (p = 0.024, p = 0.307, p = 0.007), forceps (p = 0.017, p = 0.03, p = 0.028). Less obvious differences in overall score were found for modules cracking and chopping (p = 0.266, p = 0.022, p = 0.324) and phaco (p = 0.011, p = 0.081 for the two iterations, respectively). No differences in overall score were found on hydromaneuvers (p = 0.588, p = 0.503, p = 0.773), but surgeons received better scores from the evaluations of the modified OSATS (p = 0.001) and OSACSS (capsulorhexis, p = 0.003; hydromaneuvers, p = 0.017; phaco, p = 0.001).</str>
      <str>Construct validity was found on several modules previously not investigated (phaco, hydromaneuvers, cracking and chopping, navigation), and our results confirm previously demonstrated construct validity for capsulorhexis and forceps modules. Interestingly, validation of the hydromaneuvers module required OSACSS video evaluation tool. A further development of the scoring system in the simulator for the hydromaneuvers module would be advantageous and make training and evaluation of progress more accessible and immediate.</str>

      <str>Site-specific phosphorus management is done to optimize crop production and minimize P loss from soils. The spatial variability of the available P prior to fertilizer application and the P-fixation tendency of soil both need to be taken into account for variable-rate P application. The objectives of this research were to document the spatial variability of the fertilizer-P availability index, which shows the P-fixation tendency, and to develop a strategy that takes the spatial distribution of this index into account for site-specific phosphorus application. In this study, the spatial patterns of the fertilizer-P availability index were characterized by using geostatistics. The ordinary kriging was used for spatial interpolation of the fertilizer-P availability index. Because the fertilizer-P availability index of soil is related to oxalate-extractable Fe and Al and because measuring oxalate-extractable Fe and Al is much easier than directly determining the fertilizer-P availability index, the spatial distribution of the fertilizer-P availability index can be obtained using the oxalate-extractable Fe and Al data. The spatial distribution of Olsen-extractable P, which was used to measure the available-P status prior to fertilizer-P application, was also estimated by using ordinary kriging. The required fertilizer-P amounts were then determined using the kriging estimates of the fertilizer-P availability index and Olsen-extractable P. A fertilizer-P recommendation map for the 430-ha study site in Changhua county, Taiwan was generated by using this approach for illustration. The proposed method for generating fertilizer-P recommendation maps can be used for variable-rate application to maintain an adequate P status for crop production and to potentially reduce the P loss from soils.</str>

      <str>The biosynthesis of the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin involves N-hydroxytyrosine, (E)- and (Z)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime, p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile, and p-hydroxymandelonitrile as intermediates and has been studied in vitro using a microsomal enzyme system obtained from etiolated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) seedlings. The biosynthesis is inhibited by carbon monoxide and the inhibition is reversed by 450 nm light demonstrating the involvement of cytochrome P-450. The combined use of two differently prepared microsomal enzyme systems and of tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime, and p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile as substrates identify two cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases: the N-hydroxylase which converts tyrosine into N-hydroxytyrosine and the C-hydroxylase converting p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile into p-hydroxymandelonitrile. The inhibitory effect of a number of putative cytochrome P-450 inhibitors confirms the involvement of cytochrome P-450. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies raised toward NADPH-cytochrome P-450-reductase isolated from sorghum inhibits the same metabolic conversions as carbon monoxide. No cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase catalyzing an N-hydroxylation reaction has previously been reported in plants. The metabolism of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime is completely dependent on the presence of NADPH and oxygen and results in the production of p-hydroxymandelonitrile with no accumulation of the intermediate p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile in the reaction mixture. The apparent NADPH and oxygen requirements of the oxime-metabolizing enzyme are identical to those of the succeeding C-hydroxylase converting p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile to p-hydroxymandelonitrile. Due to the complex kinetics of the microsomal enzyme system, these requirements may not appertain to the oxime-metabolizing enzyme, which may convert p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime to p-hydroxyacetonitrile by a simple dehydration.</str>

      <str>It remains unclear whether any aspect of quality of life has a role in predicting survival in an unselected cohort of patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer. Therefore the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), clinico-pathological characteristics and survival in patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer. Patients presenting with gastric or oesophageal cancer, staged using the UICC tumour node metastasis (TNM) classification and who received either potentially curative surgery or palliative treatment between November 1997 and December 2002 (n=152) participated in a quality of life study, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire. On univariate analysis, age (P&lt;0.01), tumour length (P&lt;0.0001), TNM stage (P&lt;0.0001), weight loss (P&lt;0.0001), dysphagia score (P&lt;0.001), performance status (P&lt;0.1) and treatment (P&lt;0.0001) were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival. EORTC QLQ-C30, physical functioning (P&lt;0.0001), role functioning (P&lt;0.001), cognitive functioning (P&lt;0.01), social functioning (P&lt;0.0001), global quality of life (P&lt;0.0001), fatigue (P&lt;0.0001), nausea/vomiting (P&lt;0.01), pain (P&lt;0.001), dyspnoea (P&lt;0.0001), appetite loss (P&lt;0.0001) and constipation (P&lt;0.05) were also significantly associated with cancer-specific survival. On multivariate survival analysis, tumour stage (P&lt;0.0001), treatment (P&lt;0.001) and appetite loss (P&lt;0.0001) were significant independent predictors of cancer-specific survival. The present study highlights the importance of quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) measures, in particular appetite loss, as a prognostic factor in these patients.</str>

      <str>The nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (NCOA5) was a unique coactivator independent of AF2 that can modulate ERα-mediated transcription. Recent researches have indicated that its downregulation may participate in cancer development and progression. The aims of the present study were to investigate NCOA5 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and validate its possible influence on patients' prognosis. NCOA5 expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining in 119 ESCC patients' tissues. Ten paired tumor and adjacent normal specimens were examined by Western blot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed to assess its relevance with various clinicopathologic features and its influence on patients' survival. By immunohistochemistry analysis, NCOA5 expression was found to be significantly correlated with differentiation (P = 0.039), T status (P = 0.047) and stage (P = 0.036). Furthermore, we found NCOA5 higher expression in normal tissues than in tumor tissues by Western blot analysis. Univariate analysis showed that poor differentiation (P = 0.035, P = 0.027), lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001), high T status (P = 0.010, P = 0.012), advanced stage (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) and NCOA5 low expression (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly correlated with poor prognosis of both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis showed that NCOA5 low expression (P = 0.019, P = 0.047), high T status (P = 0.015, P = 0.012), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.040, P = 0.021) and advanced stage (P = 0.017, P = 0.046) were independent prognostic factors of poor DFS and OS. Our findings suggest that NCOA5 low expression is associated with ESCC progression and is a potential biomarker in predicting poor prognosis. Further studies of NCOA5 may help develop new therapeutic strategies against ESCC.</str>

      <str>Ab initio MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ calculations have been carried out to investigate the influence of F-H···F hydrogen bonds on the P···N pnicogen bond in complexes nFH:(H2FP:NFH2) for n = 1-2, and a selected complex with n = 3. The NBO analysis indicates that the N(lp) → P-Fσ* charge-transfer transition has a much greater stabilizing effect than the P(lp) → N-Fσ* transition. When hydrogen bonding occurs at P-F, charge transfer associated with the pnicogen bond and the hydrogen bond are in the same direction but are in opposite directions when hydrogen bonding occurs at N-F. As a result, the formation of F-H···F hydrogen bonds at P-F leads to shorter P···N distances, increased strength of P···N bonds, and synergistic energetic effects; hydrogen bonding at N-F has opposite effects. (31)P and (15)N chemical shieldings do not correlate with charges on P and N, respectively, but (31)P shieldings correlate quadratically with the P-N distance. (1p)J(P-N) coupling constants do not correlate with the intermolecular P-N distance. However, when hydrogen bonding occurs only at P-F, (1p)J(P-N) decreases in absolute value as the P-N distance decreases, thereby approaching (1)J(P-N) for H2P-NH2. However, the P···N bond in 3FH:(H2FP:NFH2) has little covalent character, unlike the P···P bond in the corresponding complex 3FH:(PH2F)2. </str>

      <str>Patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) are prone to develop permanent AF and have an increased thromboembolic risk. We have previously shown that P wave dispersion (P dispersion), defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum P wave duration, and maximum P wave duration (P maximum) can distinguish patients with paroxysmal lone AF. The ability of those ECG markers and of other clinical and ECG variables to detect patients at risk for recurrent AF was tested in 88 patients, aged 64 +/- 12 years. All patients had a history of symptomatic episodes of AF during the last 2 years and had not previously received any antiarrhythmic prophylaxis. P maximum and P dispersion were calculated from a 12-lead surface ECG recorded in all patients during sinus rhythm. A computerized ECG system was used and P maximum and P dispersion were calculated on screen from the averaged complexes of all 12 leads. Age (P = 0.01), history of organic heart disease (P = 0.03), P maximum (P &lt; 0.001), minimum P wave duration (P = 0.05), and P dispersion (P &lt; 0.001) were found to be significant univariate predictors of recurrent AF, whereas only P maximum (P &lt; 0.001) and age (P = 0.037) remained significant independent predictors of frequent AF paroxysms in the multivariate analysis. It is concluded that advanced age and prolonged P wave duration may be used as predictors of frequently relapsing AF. Therefore, simple AF predictors exist that could possibly distinguish the patients in whom prophylaxis with antiarrhythmic medicines should be instituted.</str>

To establish the topological sites of Glc-P-Dol synthesis and the lipid-mediated glucosyltransfer reactions involved in Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol synthesis in ER vesicles from pig brain, the trypsin-sensitivity of Glc-P-Dol synthase activity and the Glc-P-Dol:Glc0-2Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol glucosyltransferases (GlcTases) was examined in sealed microsomal vesicles. Since ER vesicles from brain do not contain glucose 6-phosphate (Glc 6-P) phosphatase activity, the latency of the lumenally oriented, processing glucosidase I/II activities was used to assess the intactness of the vesicle preparations. Comparative enzymatic studies with sealed ER vesicles from brain and kidney, a tissue that contains Glc 6-P phosphatase, demonstrate the reliability of using the processing glucosidase activities as latency markers for topological studies with microsomal vesicles from non-gluconeogenic tissues lacking Glc 6-P phosphatase. The results obtained from the trypsin-sensitivity assays with sealed microsomal vesicles from brain are consistent with a topological model in which Glc-P-Dol is synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, and subsequently utilized by the three Glc-P-Dol-mediated GlcTases after "flip-flopping" to the lumenal monolayer.</str>

      <str>Hyperleptinemia during postnatal life induces long-term effects on metabolism. However, these effects are controversial as both increased and decreased propensity towards obesity has been reported. To further analyze the effects of chronic neonatal hyperleptinemia on the subsequent metabolic profile, male Wistar rats proceeding from 18 different litters (8 pups/litter) received a daily subcutaneous injection of either saline (10 ml/kg, n=36) or leptin (3 μg/g, n=36) from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND9. Rats were sacrificed at 10, 40, or 150 days of age. At 10 days of age, leptin treated rats had decreased body weight (p&lt;0.001) and body fat (p&lt;0.05). Leptin levels and glycemia were increased (p&lt;0.01), whereas insulin, total lipids, triglycerides and glycerol levels were decreased (p&lt;0.05). At PND40 rats receiving leptin had increased glycemia (p&lt;0.01) and plasma HDL and LDL levels, but decreased total lipids (p&lt;0.05). At PND150 neonatal leptin treatment induced different effects in rats raised in different litters. Rats from litter 1 had increased body weight (p&lt;0.05), body fat (p&lt;0.01), and plasma leptin (p&lt;0.001), cholesterol (p&lt;0.001), triglyceride (p&lt;0.001), total lipid (p&lt;0.001), LDL (p&lt;0.05), and glycerol (p&lt;0.001) levels.

      <str>A phosphorus (P) index for pastures was developed to write nutrient management plans that determine how much P can be applied to a given field. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate and compare the P index for pastures, particularly the P source component, and an environmental threshold soil test P level by conducting rainfall simulations on contrasting soils under various management scenarios; and (ii) evaluate the P index for pastures on field-scale watersheds. Poultry litter was applied to 12 small plots on each of six farms based on either an environmental threshold soil test P level or on the P index for pastures, and P runoff was evaluated using rainfall simulators. The P index was also evaluated from two small (0.405 ha) watersheds that had been fertilized annually with poultry litter since 1995. Results from the small plot study showed that soil test P alone was a poor predictor of P concentrations in runoff water following poultry litter applications. The relationship between P in runoff and the amount of soluble P applied was highly significant. Furthermore, P concentrations in runoff from plots with and without litter applications were significantly correlated to P index values. Studies on pastures receiving natural rainfall and annual poultry litter applications indicated that the P index for pastures predicted P loss accurately without calibration (y = 1.16x - 0.23, r(2) = 0.83). These data indicate that the P index for pastures can accurately assess the risk of P loss from fields receiving poultry litter applications in Arkansas and provide a more realistic risk assessment than threshold soil test P levels.</str>

As previously found for P to sucrose, P to solutes is smaller in mesothelium than in connective tissue, although the latter is approximately 35-fold thicker; instead, P(w) is higher in mesothelium, suggesting marked water diffusion through cell membrane. Equivalent radius of paracellular "pores" of mesothelium was computed with two approaches, disregarding P(w).

In intact rats, 1 h after gavage, serum P in +P was 8.0 +/- 0.5 and in -P, 6.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, p less than 0.01. One and 2 h after gavage, Pi uptake was similar between groups; at 4 h, 0.25 min Pi uptake was increased by 59.3% +/- 14.8 in -P, p less than 0.02, n = 11. In thyroparathyroidectomized rats, Pi uptake increased in -P by 40.1% +/- 7.4 compared to +P at 2.5 h after gavage, and by 51.3 +/- 9.3 at 4 h, p less than 0.025, n = 11. When actinomycin D or cycloheximide were administered both 16 h prior to and at gavage, 0.25 min Pi uptake 4 h after gavage was 59.1% +/- 14 and 60.6% +/- 19 higher in -P than +P, respectively, p less than 0.025. The adaptation was detected only when measured with an inward-directed Na-gradient. Na-dependent glucose and proline uptakes were not changed by -P diet. These studies demonstrate that early renal adaptation to low dietary P is preceded by a fall in serum P, is independent of parathyroid hormone, and does not require protein synthesis. Early adaptation may represent an increased rate of carrier movement or a change in availability of already synthesized carrier. The signal for adaptation may be the decrease in serum P, or filtered load of phosphorus.</str>

      <str>Puerarin (daidzein 8-C-glucoside) has potential on preventing osteoporosis. This study aims to investigate the effects of puerarin on osteogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro.</str>
      <str>CCK-8 assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Alizarin Red S were used to measure the effects of puerarin on proliferation, osteoblastic differentiation, and mineralization in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. The effects of puerarin on adipogenesis were measured by Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride level in preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of osteogenesis- and adiopogenesis-related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Further, the secreted osteocalcin levels and nuclear translocation of β-catenin were detected by ELISA and immunofluorescence assay, respectively.</str>
      <str>As to osteogenesis, puerarin could stimulate proliferation (1 μM, P = 0.012; 10 μM, P = 0.015; 20 μM, P = 0.050), ALP activity (20 μM, P = 0.008) and calcium nodule formation (20 μM, P = 0.011) in a dose-dependent manner. Puerarin (20 μM) promoted osteocalcin secretion (P = 0.004) and the protein expression of both osteopontin (P = 0.001) and osteoprotegerin (P = 0.003). As to adipogenesis, puerarin suppressed adipocytes formation and intracellular triglyceride level (P = 0.001). In addition, puerarin (20 μM) decreased the mRNA and protein levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (P = 0.001, P = 0.002), proliferator-activated receptor γ (P = 0.005, P = 0.003), and adipocyte lipid-binding protein 4 (P = 0.001, P = 0.001). Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT1-Ser437 (10 μM, P = 0.003; 20 μM, P = 0.007) and GSK-Ser9 (10 μM, P = 0.005; 20 μM, P = 0.003), and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin (10 μM, P = 0.006; 10 μM, P = 0.002) were increased in 3T3-L1 cells treated by puerarin.</str>

      <str>We investigated the patterns of projections from the pulvinar to visual areas V1, V2, V4, and MT, and their relationships to pulvinar subdivisions based on patterns of calbindin (CB) immunostaining and estimates of visual field maps (P(1), P(2) and P(3)). Multiple retrograde tracers were placed into V1, V2, V4, and/or MT in 11 adult macaque monkeys. The inferior pulvinar (PI) was subdivided into medial (PI(M)), posterior (PI(P)), central medial (PI(CM)), and central lateral (PI(CL)) regions, confirming earlier CB studies. The P(1) map includes PI(CL) and the ventromedial portion of the lateral pulvinar (PL), P(2) is found in ventrolateral PL, and P(3) includes PI(P), PI(M), and PI(CM). Projections to areas V1 and V2 were found to be overlapping in P(1) and P(2), but those from P(2) to V2 were denser than those to V1. V2 also received light projections from PI(CM) and, less reliably, from PI(M). Neurons projecting to V4 and MT were more abundant than those projecting to V1 and V2. Those projecting to V4 were observed in P(1), densely in P(2), and also in PI(CM) and PI(P) of P(3). Those projecting to MT were found in P(1)- P(3), with the heaviest projection from P(3). Projections from P(3) to MT and V4 were mainly interdigitated, with the densest to MT arising from PI(M) and the densest to V4 arising from PI(P) and PI(CM). Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P(3) corresponded to differential patterns of cortical connectivity, the results suggest that CB may further delineate functional subdivisions in the pulvinar.</str>

      <str>Remobilization of mineral nutrients from leaves to reproductive structures is a possible regulatory factor in leaf senescence. The relationship between P remobilization from leaves of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr. cv McCall) during reproductive development and leaf senescence was determined by utilizing soil P treatments that supplied deficient, optimum, and supraoptimum soil P levels. The soil P treatments simulated field conditions, being initiated at the time of planting with no subsequent addition or removal of P. It was hypothesized that P deficiency would accelerate leaf senescence and that supraoptimum P nutrition would delay the timing or rate of leaf senescence relative to plants grown with optimum P. Supraoptimum soil P led to a two- to fourfold increase in leaf P concentration compared with optimum P, and during senescence there was no net P remobilization from leaves for this treatment. Leaf P concentration was similar for plants grown at optimum or deficient soil P, and there was significant net P remobilization from leaves of both treatments in one of the two experiments. As indicated by changes in leaf N, carbon dioxide exchange rate, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity, and chlorophyll concentration, leaf senescence patterns were similar for all soil P treatments. Thus, it can be concluded that leaf senescence was not affected by either P deficiency or enhanced leaf P concentration resulting from supraoptimum soil P. The results suggest that P nutrition in general, and specifically P remobilization from leaves, does not exert any regulatory control on the process of leaf senescence.</str>

      <str>A detailed theoretical study is performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and G3B3 (single-point) levels as an attempt to explore the reaction mechanism of CH with C(3)H(6). It is shown that the barrierless association of CH with C(3)H(6) forms two energy-rich isomers CH(3)-cCHCHCH(2) (1), and CH(2)CH(2)CHCH(2) (4). Isomers 1 and 4 are predicted to undergo subsequent isomerization and dissociation steps leading to ten dissociation products P(1) (CH(3)-cCHCHCH + H), P(2) (CH(3)-cCCHCH(2) + H), P(3) (cCHCHCH(2) + CH(3)), P(4) (CH(3)CHCCH(2) + H), P(5) (cis-CH(2)CHCHCH(2) + H), P(6) (trans-CH(2)CHCHCH(2) + H), P(7) (C(2)H(4) + C(2)H(3)), P(8) (CH(3)CCH + CH(3)), P(9) (CH(3)CCCH(3) + H) and P(12) (CH(2)CCH(2) + CH(3)), which are thermodynamically and kinetically possible. Among these products, P(5), P(6), and P(7) may be the most favorable products with comparable yields; P(1), P(2), and P(3) may be the much less competitive products, followed by the almost negligible P(4), P(8), P(9), and P(12). Since the isomers and transition states involved in the CH + C(3)H(6) reaction all lie lower than the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be fast, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant in experiment. The present study may lead us to a deep understanding of the CH radical chemistry.</str>

      <str>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary phytase and increasing levels of available phosphorus (P(av)) on the growth performance and phosphorus metabolism of broiler chicks. In both experiments, graded levels of P provided by dicalcium phosphate and of phytase were added to a low-P corn-soybean meal basal diet. In Experiment 1, diets providing .21, .29, .37, and .44% P(av) without phytase; .21% P(av) plus .05, .10, or .30% phytase; and .29% P(av) plus .10% phytase were each fed to four groups of seven chicks, 3 days of age. In Experiment 2, diets providing P(av) levels of .32, .38, and .44% and phytase levels of .5, 1.0, and 1.5% (250, 500, and 750 units/kg) in a factorial arrangement were each fed to four groups of eight chicks, 5 days of age. In Experiment 1, increasing dietary P(av), but not phytase, increased feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion, plasma inorganic P, tibia and toe ash, and tibia breaking strength (P &lt; or = .05). Plasma inorganic P responded quadratically to increasing dietary phytase. In Experiment 2, feed intake and weight gain were increased by elevating the level of P(av), but not by phytase. Toe and tibia ash and plasma inorganic P were increased by dietary phytase and increasing levels of P(av) (P &lt; or = .01). Tibia breaking strength was improved (P &lt; or = .05) by dietary phytase but not by increasing levels of P(av). The P excretion was elevated (P &lt; or = .01) by increasing levels of P(av) and was decreased by supplemental phytase (P &lt; or = .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Hybridization and introgression can play an important role in speciation. Here, we examine their roles in the origin and evolution of Picea purpurea, a diploid spruce species occurring on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Phylogenetic relationships and ecological differences between this species and its relatives, P. schrenkiana, P. likiangensis and P. wilsonii, are unclear. To clarify them, we surveyed sequence variation within and between them for 11 nuclear loci, three chloroplast (cp) and two mitochondrial (mt) DNA fragments, and examined their ecological requirements using ecological niche modelling. Initial analyses based on 11 nuclear loci rejected a close relationship between P. schrenkiana and P. purpurea. BP&amp;P tests and ecological niche modelling indicated substantial divergence between the remaining three species and supported the species status of P. purpurea, which contained many private alleles as expected for a well-established species. Sequence variation for cpDNA and mtDNA suggested a close relationship between P. purpurea and P. wilsonii, while variation at the nuclear se1364 gene suggested P. purpurea was more closely related to P. likiangensis. Analyses of genetic divergence, Bayesian clustering and model comparison using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) of nuclear (nr) DNA variation all supported the hypothesis that P. purpurea originated by homoploid hybrid speciation from P. wilsonii and P. likiangensis. The ABC analysis dated the origin of P. purpurea at the Pleistocene, and the estimated hybrid parameter indicated that 69% of its nuclear composition was contributed by P. likiangensis and 31% by P. wilsonii. Our results further suggested that during or immediately following its formation, P. purpurea was subject to organelle DNA introgression from P. wilsonii such that it came to possess both mtDNA and cpDNA of P. wilsonii. The estimated parameters indicated that following its origin, P. purpurea underwent an expansion during/after the largest Pleistocene glaciation recorded for the QTP. </str>

      <str>To evaluate the usefulness of metabolic parameters obtained by (18)F-FDG PET/CT for preoperative stratification of high-risk and low-risk endometrial carcinomas.</str>
      <str>Preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed in 56 women with endometrial cancer. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumours were compared with clinicopathological features of surgical specimens. Diagnostic performance in terms of differentiation of low-risk disease (endometrioid histology, histological grade 1 or 2, invasion of less than half of the myometrium, and FIGO stage I) from high-risk disease was assessed.</str>
      <str>MTV and TLG were significantly higher in patients with higher histological grade (p = 0.0026 and p = 0.034), larger tumour size (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0017), lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI; p = 0.012 and p = 0.0051), myometrial invasion (p = 0.027 and p = 0.031), cervical stromal invasion (p = 0.023 and p = 0.014), ovarian metastasis (p = 0.00022 and p = 0.00034), lymph node metastasis (p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0001), and higher FIGO stage (p = 0.0011 and p = 0.00048). SUVmax was significantly higher in patients with larger tumour size (p = 0.0025), LVSI (p = 0.00023) and myometrial invasion (p &lt; 0.0001). The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk carcinoma were 0.625, 0.829 and 0.797 for SUVmax, MTV and TLG, respectively. AUCs for both MTV and TLG were significantly larger than that for SUVmax (p = 0.0049 and p = 0.021). The optimal TLG cut-off value of 70.2, determined by ROC analysis, was found to have 72.0% sensitivity and 74.2% specificity for risk stratification.</str>

P-selectin haplotypes explained about 25% of the variability of P-selectin concentrations, this effect being mainly due to the additive effects of two polymorphisms, V599L and T715P.

      <str>Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition dramatically raised in recent decades, resulting in increases of soil N availability and N/P ratio, which would impact plant growth and P efficiency under low P stress. Taking breeding population of Pinus massoniana as test materials, a pot experiment was conducted to simulate two P conditions, i. e., homogeneous low P availability vs. heterogeneous low P among soil layers, in combination with two N deposition levels on growth traits and P absorption and utilization efficiency of P. massoniana. Under the homogeneous low phosphorus condition, growth traits and P efficiency of P. massoniana were not significantly improved by simulated nitrogen deposition, but significant nitrogen x family interaction effect was detected, with the biomass of family 40x44 and 71x20 being increased, 36x29 and 73x23 being decreased. Under the heterogeneous low P condition, significant N effects on the seedling height, biomass and P absorption efficiency were observed, due to promoted root length and root distribution ratio of topsoil. In addition, the effects of simulated N deposition on growth and P efficiency of P. massoniana were relevant to the N/P ratio. Under the homogeneous low P condition, the N/P ratio of P. massoniana plant was 13.8, plants exhibited a low sensitivity to simulated N deposition, root secreted APase activity was increased but the plant growth was not promoted. In comparison, the plant N/P ratio was 9.7 under the heterogeneous low P condition, and the plant growth and P efficiency were significantly promoted, while no obvious change occurred in root secreted APase activity.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can compromise the antiretroviral effect of a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen for HIV-1, but can also reduce HIV-1 replication. We studied the net effect of P-gp on the intracellular HIV-1 RNA and DNA load in vivo. CD4(+) T cells were isolated from 27 HIV-1 patients (13 without and 14 with a PI-containing regimen) and subsequently sorted in CD45RO(-) (naive) and CD45RO(+) (memory) subsets with either high (P-gp(high)) or low (P-gp(low)) P-gp activity. Unspliced HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 DNA load were determined. For each patient P-gp(high) and P-gp(low) subsets were compared. In patients on a PI-containing regimen, intracellular unspliced HIV-1 RNA was significantly lower in P-gp(high)-naive CD4(+) cells compared to P-gp(low)-naive CD4(+) cells (p = 0.04). The same trend was seen in naive CD4(+) cells of treatment naive patients. In both treated and untreated patients HIV-1 DNA levels were significantly lower in P-gp(high) than in P-gp(low) memory CD4(+) cells (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04). High cellular P-gp activity coincided with a reduced intracellular HIV-1 load in vivo, both in therapy-naive and in PI-treated patients. Therefore we conclude that the potential efflux function of P-gp on PIs may be clinically less relevant than the effect of P-gp on intracellular HIV-1 replication.</str>

      <str>P homeostasis affected by high or low Ca and/or P supply in preruminant goats was characterized by balance studies in vivo. The main excretion pathway was the renal P(i) excretion whose extent was modulated by variations in dietary P and/or Ca supply. Faecal P excretion remained low irrespective of dietary regimen. The balance data were combined with respective in vitro data on P(i) transport properties and their adaptation in response to changes in dietary Ca and/or P intake. Therefore, P(i) transport capacities were determined by P(i) uptake into brush border membrane vesicles of jejunum and kidney. Epithelial P(i) transporters were determined semiquantitatively by northern and western blot analyses in jejunum, kidney and salivary gland. Renal P(i) transport was downregulated by doubling dietary P supply while doubling both, Ca and P as well as restrictive Ca at unchanged P led to slight, but not significant reductions in renal P(i) transport. Jejunal P(i) transport was reduced by P excess (doubling P and doubling both, Ca and P), but only NaPi IIb protein expression was significantly diminished. In conclusion, the significance of epithelial adaptation to dietary Ca and P supply for P homeostasis is discussed in preruminant goats.</str>

      <str>The phosphorylation state of the putative signal transduction protein P(II) from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 depends on the cellular state of nitrogen and carbon assimilation. In this study, dephosphorylation of phosphorylated P(II) protein (P[II]-P) was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. The in vivo studies implied that P(II)-P dephosphorylation is regulated by inhibitory metabolites involved in the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase pathway of ammonium assimilation. An in vitro assay for P(II)-P dephosphorylation was established that revealed a Mg2+-dependent P(II)-P phosphatase activity. P(II)-P phosphatase and P(II) kinase activities could be separated biochemically. A partially purified P(II)-P phosphatase preparation also catalysed the dephosphorylation of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues on other proteins in a Mg2+-dependent manner. However, only dephosphorylation of P(II)-P was regulated by synergistic inhibition by ATP and 2-oxoglutarate. As the same metabolites stimulate the P(II) kinase activity, it appears that the phosphorylation state of P(II) is determined by ATP and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent reciprocal reactivity of P(II) towards its phosphatase and kinase.</str>

      <str>Ten common neonatal congenital malformations were selected for analysis. The incidence and the Cochran-Armitage Trend were assessed via SAS9.2. A P value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.</str>
      <str>Of 83 888 perinatals, 374 (4.46‰) suffered from congenital heart diseases (CHD), 77 (0.92‰) from congenital hydrocephalus, 32 (0.38‰) from intestinal atresia/stenosis, 36 (0.43‰) from anorectal malformations, 149 (1.78‰) from kidney malformations, 139 (3.31‰) from hypospadias (male), 178 (2.12‰) from orofacial clefts (OFC), 188 (2.24‰) from polydactyly, 62 (0.74‰) from syndactyly, and 269 (3.21‰) from accessory auricle anomaly. Their trend of prevalence varied as follows: CHD, P=0.0026; hydrocephalus, P=0.0042; intestinal atresia/stenosis, P=0.0103; anorectal malformations, P=0.4332; kidney malformations, P&lt;0.0001; hypospadias, P=0.0021; OFC, P=0.005; polydactyly, P=0.0867; syndactyly, P=0.1941; and accessory auricle anomaly, P=0.0011. The upward trend was as follows: CHD (P=0.0026), intestinal atresia/stenosis (P=0.0103), kidney malformations (P&lt;0.0001), hypospadias (P=0.0021), OFC (P=0.005), and accessory auricle anomaly (P=0.0011). The incidence of hydrocephalus (P=0.0042) showed a downward trend. No statistical significant trend was found in anorectal malformations (P=0.4332), polydactyly (P=0.0867) and syndactyly (P=0.1941).</str>
      <str>The incidences of CHD, intestinal atresia/stenosis, kidney malformations, hypospadias, OFC, and accessory auricle anomaly have increased in the last 12 years, but the incidences of anorectal malformations, polydactyly and syndactyly remain stable. The incidence of hydrocephalus shows a downward trend.</str>

      <str>Metabolic activation by cytochrome P-450 of glutamic acid pyrolysis products, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-amino-dipyrido(1,2,-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-2), to mutagenic metabolites was studied using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as a tester strain. Cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and NADPH were essential requirements for the activation of these compounds. Of the four forms of cytochrome P-450 examined, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) P-448 and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) P-448 purified from liver microsomes of rats treated with a PCB mixture and MC, respectively, showed high activity in the activation of both Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2. The presence of three metabolites from Glu-P-1 or Glu-P-2 was demonstrated by high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis. Among the metabolites of Glu-P-1, two metabolites were mutagenic without any further enzymatic activation. In accordance with the results of a mutation assay, PCB P-448 also exhibited higher activity to form the major mutagenic metabolite of Glu-P-1. The major active metabolite of Glu-P-1 was characterized as N-hydroxy-Glu-P-1 by chemical analysis using oxidizing and reducing reagents and by mass spectrometry.</str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of three perennial legume species to access sources of varyingly soluble phosphorus (P) and their associated morphological and physiological adaptations. Two Australian native legumes with pasture potential (Cullen australasicum and Kennedia prostrata) and Medicago sativa cv. SARDI 10 were grown in sand under two P levels (6 and 40 µg P g(-1) ) supplied as Ca(H2 PO4 )2 ·H2 O (Ca-P, highly soluble, used in many fertilizers) or as one of three sparingly soluble forms: Ca10 (OH)2 (PO4 )6 (apatite-P, found in relatively young soils; major constituent of rock phosphate), C6 H6 O24 P6 Na12 (inositol-P, the most common form of organic P in soil) and FePO4 (Fe-P, a poorly-available inorganic source of P). All species grew well with soluble P. When 6 µg P g(-1) was supplied as sparingly soluble P, plant dry weight (DW) and P uptake were very low for C. australasicum and M. sativa (0.1-0.4 g DW) with the exception of M. sativa supplied with apatite-P (1.5 g). In contrast, K. prostrata grew well with inositol-P (1.0 g) and Fe-P (0.7 g), and even better with apatite-P (1.7 g), similar to that with Ca-P (1.9 g). Phosphorus uptake at 6 µg P g(-1) was highly correlated with total root length, total rhizosphere carboxylate content and total rhizosphere acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) activity. These findings provide strong indications that there are opportunities to utilize local Australian legumes in low P pasture systems to access sparingly soluble soil P and increase perennial legume productivity, diversity and sustainability. </str>

      <str>Organochlorine pesticides were used extensively in the Yangtze River Delta, China. However, knowledge about their residual levels and environmental fates in soils of this area is limited. This paper presents the residue isomers and spatial pattern of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in soils across 17 main cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Forty-three soil surface (0-15 cm) samples were collected during a field campaign conducted in October 2003 in the Delta. Six DDT isomers (1-[2-chlorophenyl]-1-[4-chlorophenyl]-2,2-dichloroethane [o,p'-DDD], 1-[2-chlorophenyl]-1-[4-chlorophenyl]-2,2-dichloroethylene [o,p-'DDE], 1,1,1-trichloro-2-[p-chlorophenyl]-2-[o-chlorophenyl]ethane [o,p'-DDT], p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [p,p'-DDD], p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [p,p'-DDE], p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [p,p'-DDT]) were detected using gas chromatography. The results show that p,p'-DDE was the dominant isomer in the soil samples. The levels of DDT are generally low in soils of this area and are comparable to DDT levels in other cities in China and in soils from developed countries such as the United States and Germany. The isomer ratios of o,p'-DDT to p,p'-DDT and DDT to (DDD + DDE) were employed to identify the source of DDT. The computed ratios implied that the source of DDT might be related to the application of dicofol, an acaricide manufactured from technical DDTs and mainly used on cotton fields to treat mites.</str>

Addition of C2 F5 P(O)(OH)H to solid PtCl2 under different reaction conditions allows the isolation and full characterization of the mononuclear complexes [ClPt{P(C2 F5 )(OH)O}{P(C2 F5 )(OH)2 }2 ] and [Pt{P(C2 F5 )(OH)O}2 {P(C2 F5 )(OH)2 }] containing hydrogen-bridged [R(f) P(OH)O](-) and R(f) P(OH)2 units. Further deprotonation of [Pt{P(C2 F5 )(OH)O}2 {P(C2 F5 )(OH)2 }2 ] leads to the formation of the dianionic platinate, [Pt{P(C2 F5 )(OH)O}4 ](2-) , revealing four intramolecular hydrogen bridges. With PdCl2 the dinuclear complex [Pd2 (μ-Cl)2 {[P(C2 F5 )(OH)O]2 H}2 ] was isolated and characterized. The Cl(-) free complex [Pd{P(C2 F5 )(OH)O}2 {P(C2 F5 )(OH)2 }2 ] was also prepared and deprotonated to the dianionic palladate, [Pd{P(C2 F5 )(OH)O}4 ](2-) . Both compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray analyses. In addition, the C6 F5 derivatives [ClPt{P(C6 F5 )(OH)O}{P(C6 F5 )(OH)2 }2 ] and [Pd2 (μ-Cl)2 {[P(C6 F5 )(OH)O]2 H}2 ] as well as the CF3 derivative [Pd2 (μ-Cl)2 {[P(CF3 )(OH)O]2 H}2 ] were synthesized and fully characterized. Phosphonous acid complexes are inert towards air and moisture and can be stored for several months without decomposition. The catalytic activity of the palladium complexes in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 1-bromo-3-fluorobenzene and phenyl boronic acid was demonstrated. </str>

      <str>We studied the actions of substance P, bombesin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8-S) on the release of somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon from the isolated perfused pancreatico-duodenal canine preparation. Substance P at concentrations ranging from 0.2-5.0 nM stimulated the secretion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon in a dose-dependent manner. However, the responses evoked by substance P were modified by the prevailing glucose level; higher somatostatin and insulin and lower glucagon responses were obtained at the high glucose concentration of 8.3 mM rather than at the low glucose concentration of 2.8 mM. At a glucose concentration of 5.5 mM, somatostatin release was above the prestimulation level in response to 1 nM substance P (89 +/- 15%; P less than 0.01), VIP (49 +/- 7%; P less than 0.01), or CCK-8-S (99 +/- 21%; P less than 0.01); bombesin was without effect (16 +/- 14; P = NS). Insulin release was enhanced by substance P (150 +/- 45%; P less than 0.05), bombesin (162 +/- 56%; P less than 0.05), VIP (44 +/- 5%; P less than 0.01), and CCK-8-S (190 +/- 17%; P less than 0.001).

      <str>To our knowledge, no prospective study has examined the association between blood levels of organochlorines and breast cancer risk in Asian countries. Here, we tested the hypothesis that higher blood levels of organochlorines are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Japanese women. A total of 24,226 women subjects of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire and provided blood in 1990-1995 were followed to December 2002. During 10.7 years follow-up, 144 cases of breast cancer were newly diagnosed. Two matched-controls for each case were selected from the cohort. Plasma levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) were measured. A conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of breast cancer according to cholesterol-adjusted organochlorine levels based on 139 matched pairs. We found no statistically significant positive association between plasma organochlorine level and breast cancer risk. Adjusted ORs for p,p'-DDT, HCB, and beta-HCH were less than 1. For p,p'-DDE, adjusted OR for the highest versus lowest quartile was 1.48 (95% confidence interval 0.70-3.13; p for trend=0.25). A stratified analysis by menopausal status showed positive associations for p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in premenopausal but not postmenopausal women, although without statistical significance. Our data do not support the hypothesis that plasma levels of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, HCB, and beta-HCH are associated with an overall increased risk of breast cancer among Japanese women.</str>

The relationship between MSCT features and pathologic classification of P-NENs was analysed with univariate and multivariate models.</str>
      <str>Contrast-enhanced images showed significant differences among the three grades of tumours in the absolute enhancement (P = 0.013) and relative enhancement (P = 0.025) at the arterial phase. Univariate analysis revealed statistically significant differences among the tumours of different grades (based on World Health Organization [WHO] 2010 classification) in tumour size (P = 0.001), tumour contour (P &lt; 0.001), cystic necrosis (P = 0.001), tumour boundary (P = 0.003), dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (P = 0.001), peripancreatic tissue or vascular invasion (P &lt; 0.001), lymphadenopathy (P = 0.011), and distant metastasis (P = 0.012). Multivariate analysis suggested that only peripancreatic tissue or vascular invasion (HR 3.934, 95 % CI, 0.426-7.442, P = 0.028) was significantly associated with WHO 2010 pathological classification.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) quantity-intensity relationships are central to the solubility and release of P from soil to water. Relationships between P extractable by 0.5 M NaHCO extractable P (Olsen P; quantity, Q) and P extractable by 0.01 M CaCl(2) (CaCl(2)-P; possible predictor of soil solution or drainage water P; intensity, I) are curvilinear: above a certain Olsen P concentration, CaCl(2)-P becomes much more soluble than when below it. Aluminium-, Fe- and Ca-P forms (extractable by Olsen's reagent) are thought to control P solubility. Thus, our objectives were to identify P forms in equilibrium with CaCl(2)-P via solubility equilibrium experiments, and the behaviour of CaCl(2)-P in relation to Al, Fe and Ca associated P, determined with 31P high power decoupling magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P HPDec/MAS NMR). Results indicated that two Q-I relationships occurred, one for soils above pH 5.8, and the other for soils below pH 5.8. Above pH 5.8, soils were saturated with respect to hydroxyapatite (Ca(5)(PO(4))(3)OH) and undersaturated with respect to beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-Ca(3)(PO(4))(2)), while log ion-activity products showed that all soils and pHs were either saturated or in equilibrium with variscite (AlPO(4).2H(2)O) or its amorphous analogue. Using 31P HPDec/MAS NMR, Ca-P was best correlated with CaCl(2)-P in soils above pH 5.8, and with Al-P in soils below this pH. This study demonstrates the value of solid-state NMR in conjunction with wet chemical techniques for the study of labile P and P loss from pasture soils with a wide range of managements.</str>

      <str>P wave parameters measured by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly used as a noninvasive tool to evaluate left atrial enlargement. This study was designed to assess whether P wave parameters were associated with renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This longitudinal study enrolled 439 patients with CKD stages 3-5. Renal end points were defined as the commencement of dialysis or death. Change in renal function was measured using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. We measured two ECG P wave parameters corrected for heart rate, i.e., corrected P wave dispersion and corrected maximum P wave duration. The values of P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration were 88.8±21.7 ms and 153.3±21.7 ms, respectively. During the follow-up period (mean, 25.2 months), 95 patients (21.6%) started hemodialysis and 30 deaths (6.8%) were recorded. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that increased P wave dispersion [hazard ratio (HR), 1.020; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.009-1.032; P&lt;0.001] and maximum P wave duration (HR, 1.013; 95% CI, 1.003-1.024; P = 0.012) were associated with progression to renal end points. Furthermore, increased P wave dispersion (unstandardized coefficient β = -0.016; P = 0.037) and maximum P wave duration (unstandardized coefficient β = -0.014; P = 0.040) were negatively associated with the eGFR slope. We demonstrated that increased P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration were associated with progression to the renal end points of dialysis or death and faster renal function decline in CKD patients. Screening CKD patients on the basis of P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration may help identify patients at high risk for worse renal outcomes. </str>

The basal corn-soybean meal diet contained .06% available P, .32% total P, and .55% Ca with no added inorganic P. The basal diet was supplemented with 0, 250, or 500 phytase units (PU)/kg of diet.

Pigs were individually penned and fed their respective diets to appetite in four equal meals daily. There were no soaking x phytase interactions (P &gt; .1 to .6) for growth performance criteria. Daily gain and gain/feed ratio were increased (P &lt; .01) by soaking and increased linearly (P &lt; .01) by phytase. Daily feed intake was increased linearly (P &lt; .01) by phytase.

      <str>Cytochrome P-450dNIR (P-450dNIR), involved in the fungal denitrification by Fusarium oxysporum, was purified to homogeneity. The cytochrome P-450 (P-450) exhibited a potent nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity to form nitrous oxide (N2O) employing NADH but not NADPH as the sole effective electron donor. The apparent maximum turnover rate against NO was estimated as high as 31,500 min-1. The stoichiometry of the reaction between NO:NADH:N2O was 2:1:1. The reaction required neither an artificial electron-carrying mediator nor other proteinaceous components. An anaerobic incubation of ferric P-450dNIR.NO complex, but not of free ferric P-450dNIR, resulted in rapid reduction of the P-450, indicating that P-450dNIR.NO complex was reduced directly by NADH. Spectral changes during catalytic turnover indicated that decomposition of the ferrous P-450.NO complex might be rate-limiting. The reaction was not inhibited by carbon monoxide at all, suggesting that the free ferrous P-450 is not formed during turnover. On the basis of these results a possible reaction mechanism was considered. The present results demonstrated not only the unique reaction catalyzed by P-450, but also the first P-450-dependent reaction where the electron transport from NAD(P)H to P-450 is not supported by other components. Now that the physiological function of P-450 55A1 (P-450dNIR) has been found, we propose to alter the trivial name to P-450nor.</str>

The following mutagenic potency series, expressed as the minimum detectable mutagen concentration (MDMC) in nmol/ml, was obtained with Salmonella in the presence of rat liver postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS): DB[al]P (3.7), B[a]P (5.8), DB[ae]P (6.9), DB[ai]P (14.9), DB[ah]P (&gt; 100). None of the compounds were mutagenic in the absence of PMS. In human MCL-5 cells the potency series was: DB[al]P (3.1 x 10(-4)), B[a]P (1.5 x 10(-2)), DB[ae]P (2.5 x 10(-2)), DB[ah]P (0.5), DB[ai]P (3.2). The human cell assay thus exhibited over a 10,000-fold range between the most mutagenic and least mutagenic compound, whereas in the bacterial assay there was only a corresponding four-fold difference if the nonmutagenic DB[ah]P was excluded. The results were discussed in terms of their concordance with animal carcinogenicity studies.</str>

      <str>To evaluate the clinical relevance of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, the intracellular daunorubicin accumulation (IDA) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression were investigated in 87 adult patients with acute leukemia: 69 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 with AML at relapse, and eight with secondary leukemia to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS-AML). IDA and P-gp expression were determined by double-labeling flow cytometry analysis. Of 87 patients, 36 expressed P-gp (41%). P-gp expression was more frequently observed in AML at relapse and MDS-AML as compared with de novo AML (P = .0001). P-gp expression was significantly associated with CD34 expression (P = .0003) and chromosome 7 abnormalities (P = .027). A significantly reduced IDA was observed in P-gp+ as compared with P-gp- patients (P = .0007). Of the 87 patients, 51 achieved complete remission (CR). A reduced IDA was observed in patients in failure as compared with patients in CR (22% +/- 17% v 42% +/- 21%; P = 10(-4). Twelve of 36 P-gp+ patients as compared with 40 of 51 P-gp- patients achieved CR (33% v 78%; P = 10(-4). The prognostic value of IDA and P-gp expression was confirmed in multivariate analysis. These data suggest that the determination of IDA and P-gp expression may be useful in designing therapy for patients with AML.</str>

      <str>Paragonimus heterotremus, which is an important pathogen for human paragonimiasis in Asia, is recognized as having the smallest metacercariae (maximum diameter &lt; 300 μm) of any previously reported Paragonimus species. Recently, P. pseudoheterotremus has been described from Thailand as a new species having metacercariae (about 200 μm) slightly smaller than those of Thai P. heterotremus. In fact, the small size of P. pseudoheterotremus metacercariae is compatible with those of P. heterotremus from India and China. In this study in Vietnam, we found variably sized small metacercariae which are expected to consist of both P. heterotremus and P. pseudoheterotremus. Contrary to expectation, the adult flukes obtained by separate infection of experimental cats with different sized metacercariae were all identified as P. heterotremus, using both morphological and molecular characteristics. The molecular analyses of an extensive collection of P. heterotremus/P. pseudoheterotremus isolates from Asian countries also indicated that genetic distances between different populations of P. heterotremus are even larger than that between P. pseudoheterotremus and P. heterotremus. The haplotype network showed that all P. heterotremus and P. pseudoheterotremus isolates formed a P. heterotremus complex consisting of three groups with strong geographical origins. In addition, the Indian P. heterotremus group is the root of the other P. heterotremus and P. pseudoheterotremus populations. Based on the observed metacercarial polymorphisms and genetic variation in P. heterotremus, P. pseudoheterotremus should be considered a geographically isolated population of the P. heterotremus complex. </str>

      <str>Halothane is an important human and veterinary anesthetic, which produces free radicals during biotransformation. Occasionally, these free radicals may cause hepatic injury, especially in case of multiple halothane exposures over short periods. Vitamin C may protect cellular lipids and lipoproteins against oxidative damage by the free radicals. This study investigated the effects of vitamin C on liver enzymes and other biochemical parameters in rats anesthetized with halothane. One group of rats was used as a control, and saline (0.9% NaCl) was injected intraperitoneally into these animals as a placebo. The second group of rats was used as an anesthesia control group and was only anesthetized by halothane for 2 h. The third group was anesthetized by halothane and injected vitamin C intraperitoneally. Activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) by halothane anesthesia, but decreased (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) with administration of vitamin C. Concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, total bilirubin and creatinine were statistically affected (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, and p &lt; 0.01, respectively) by injection of vitamin C. Values of erythrocyte counts, packet cell volumes, hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte counts, rates of neutrophils and lymphocytes were significantly affected (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively) by halothane anesthesia. The values of erythrocyte counts, leukocyte counts, neutrophil and lymphocyte rates were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively) with administration of vitamin C. Based upon these results, vitamin C may play an important role in the prevention of hepatic cellular injury inflicted by halothane anesthesia.</str>

      <str>Measurements by P-wave signal-averaged electrocardiogram (P-SAECG) of P-wave duration and P-wave voltage integral are higher in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) than in those with sinus rhythm. Hypertension is perhaps the most common cardiovascular antecedent cause of AF, and particularly a disproportionate cause of morbidity and mortality among blacks. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of hypertension and ethnicity on P-SAECG parameters in patients without AF.</str>
      <str>It was hypothesized that P-SAECG parameters can identify hypertensives, and are disproportionately higher in hypertensive blacks.</str>
      <str>In all, 234 normotensives and 84 hypertensives underwent P-SAECG analysis. In an ancillary study group of 34 hypertensive black men, the relationship between severity of hypertension and measured parameters of P-SAECG was evaluated.</str>
      <str>Mean filtered P-wave duration and total P-wave voltage integral for normotensives of both ethnic groups were similar. Hypertensive blacks had greater increase in P-wave duration (138 +/- 16 vs. 132 +/- 12ms;p &lt; 0.01, N42:42) and total P-wave voltage integral (922 +/- 285 vs. 764 +/- 198 microV-ms; p &lt; 0.001) than white hypertensives. Filtered P-wave duration and total P-wave voltage integral increased with severity of hypertension.</str>
      <str>Patients at very early stages of hypertension have demonstrable evidence of prolonged atrial conduction by P-SAECG and, thus, cardiac electrical remodeling. P-wave duration and total P-wave voltage integral increase with severity of hypertension. Hypertensive blacks manifest a greater increase in P-SAECG parameters than whites. This may portend an increased cardiovascular risk for black patients with hypertension.</str>

      <str>The Neotropical Phyllomedusa burmeisteri treefrog group includes four diploid (P. bahiana, P. burmeisteri, P. distincta and P. iheringii) and one tetraploid (P. tetraploidea) forms. Here we use mitochondrial and nuclear sequence variation from across its range to verify if recognized morphospecies correspond to phylogenetic clades, examine the origin of the polyploid P. tetraploidea, and compare range wide patterns of diversification to those of other BAF organisms. We compared single gene trees with one Bayesian multi-gene tree, and one Bayesian species tree inferred under a coalescent framework. Our mtDNA phylogenetic analyses showed that P. bahiana, P. burmeisteri and P. iheringii correspond to monophyletic clades, while P. distincta and P. tetraploidea were paraphyletic. The nuclear gene trees were concordant in revealing two moderately supported groups including (i) P. bahiana and P. burmeisteri (northern species) and (ii) P. distincta, P.tetraploidea and P. iheringii (southern species). The multi-gene tree and the species tree retrieved similar topologies, giving high support to the northern and southern clades, and to the sister-taxa relationship between P. tetraploidea and P. distincta. Estimates of (t)MRCA suggest a major split within the P. burmeisteri group at ≈ 5 Myr (between northern and southern groups), while the main clades were originated between ≈ 0.4 and 2.5 Myr, spanning the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. Patterns of geographic and temporal diversification within the group were congruent with those uncovered for other co-distributed organisms. Independent paleoecological and geological data suggest that vicariance associated with climatic oscillations and neotectonic activity may have driven lineage divergence within the P. burmeisteri group. P. tetraploidea probably originated from polyploidization of P. distincta or from a common ancestor.</str>

      <str>Norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are both enterically-transmitted viruses causing gastroenteritis and hepatitis, respectively, in humans. While a vaccine against HEVs recently became available in China, there is no prophylactic or therapeutic approach against NoVs. Both NoV and HEV have surface protrusions formed by dimers of the protruding (P) domains of the viral capsids, which is responsible for virus-host interactions and eliciting viral neutralizing antibody. We developed in this study a bivalent vaccine against the two viruses through a recently developed polyvalent complex platform. The dimeric P domains of NoV and HEV were fused together, designated as NoV P(-)-HEV P, which was then linked with the dimeric glutathione-S-transferase (GST). After expression and purification in E. coli, the GST-NoV P(-)-HEV P fusion protein assembled into polyvalent complexes with a mean size of 1.8μm, while the NoV P(-)-HEV P formed oligomers ranging from 100 to 420kDa. Mouse immunization study demonstrated that both GST-NoV P(-)-HEV P and NoV P(-)-HEV P complexes induced significantly higher antibody titers to NoV P(-) and HEV P, respectively, than those induced by a mixture of the NoV P(-) and HEV P dimers. Furthermore, the complex-induced antisera exhibited significantly higher neutralizing activity against HEV infection in HepG2/3A cells and higher blocking activity on NoV P particles binding to HBGA receptors than those of the dimer-induced antisera. Thus, GST-NoV P(-)-HEV P and NoV P(-)-HEV P complexes are promising dual vaccine candidates against both NoV and HEV. </str>

Higher P-selectin was associated with a greater risk of sudden cardiac death among males (p = 0.05). The associations between increasing P-selectin and cardiovascular mortality as well as sudden cardiac death in males persisted after adjustment for C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, serum albumin and platelet count (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively).

      <str>Phosphine (PH(3)) is a natural gaseous carrier of phosphorus (P) in its geochemical cycles, and it might be important to the P balance of natural ecosystems. Paddy fields are thought to be one of the main sources responsible for the production and emission of PH(3) in to the environment. The relationships between matrix-bound PH(3) (MBP) and different P fractions, as well as selected metals were investigated to explore the possible production of MBP and its link to P cycle in the paddy soils. MBP range from 20.8 (-1) to 502 ng kg(-1) with an average of 145 ng kg(-1). Concentrations at the milk stage are significantly higher than at the jointing stage. The total P range from 333 mg kg(-1) to 592 mg kg(-1). Average P fractions decrease in the order: Ca-P (69.9%) &gt; Organic P (16.5%) &gt; occluded P (6.50%) &gt; Fe-P (5.93%) &gt; dissolved P (0.80%) &gt; exchangeable P (0.32%) &gt; Al-P (0.02%). Different levels of nitrogen fertilizer have little effect on the contents of MBP, P fractions and metals. A significant positive correlation between MBP and Ca-P (p = 0.002), as well as between MBP and Ca (p = 0.008) could be observed, suggesting that Ca-P mainly affects the production of MBP in the paddy soils. It is suggested that soil MBP is strongly linked to Ca-P fertilizer use because soil spiked with P-fertilizer produced an additional 758 ± 142 ng of MBP per kg of soil, compared to only 81.7 ± 12.3 ng of MBP per kg of unspiked soil. No correlations are found between MBP and other P fractions, or between MBP and Al, Fe and Mn.</str>

      <str>During acclimatization to the hypoxia of altitude, the cerebral circulation is exposed to arterial hypoxia and hypocapnia, two stimuli with opposing influences on cerebral blood flow (CBF). In order to understand the resultant changes in CBF, this study examined the responses of CBF during a period of constant mild hypoxia both with and without concomitant regulation of arterial P(CO2). Nine subjects were each exposed to two protocols in a purpose-built chamber: (1) 48 h of isocapnic hypoxia (Protocol I), where end-tidal P(O2) (P(ET,O2)) was held at 60 Torr and end-tidal P(CO2) (P(ET,CO2)) at the subject's resting value prior to experimentation; and (2) 48 h of poikilocapnic hypoxia (Protocol P), where P(ET,O2) was held at 60 Torr and P(ET,CO2) was uncontrolled. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to assess CBF. At 24 h intervals during and after the hypoxic exposure CBF was measured and the sensitivity of CBF to acute variations in P(O2) and P(CO2) was determined. During Protocol P, P(ET,CO2) decreased by 13% (P &lt; 0.001) and CBF decreased by 6% (P &lt; 0.05), whereas during Protocol I, P(ET,CO2) and CBF remained unchanged. The sensitivity of CBF to acute variations in P(O2) and P(CO2) increased by 103% (P &lt; 0.001) and 28% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, over the 48 h period of hypoxia. These changes did not differ between protocols. In conclusion, CBF decreases during mild poikilocapnic hypoxia, indicating that there is a predominant effect on CBF of the associated arterial hypocapnia. This fall occurs despite increases in the sensitivity of CBF to acute variations in P(O2)/P(CO2) arising directly from the hypoxic exposure.</str>

      <str>Patients with atrial septal defect (ASD) have an increased risk for atrial fibrillation (AF). Previously it was shown that maximum P wave duration and P wave dispersion in 12-lead surface electrocardiograms are significantly increased in individuals with a history of paroxysmal AF. We studied P maximum and P dispersion in adult patients with ASD during normal sinus rhythm. In addition, the impact of surgical closure of ASD on these variables within 1 year after surgery was evaluated.</str>
      <str>Thirty-four patients (21 women, 13 men; mean age: 35 +/- 11 years) operated on for ostium secundum type ASD and 24 age-matched healthy subjects (13 women, 11 men; mean age: 37 +/- 10 years) were investigated. P maximum, P minimum, and P dispersion (maximum - minimum P wave duration) were measured from the 12-lead surface electrocardiography.</str>
      <str>P maximum was found to be significantly longer in patients with ASD as compared to controls (115.2 +/- 9 vs 99.3 +/- 14 ms; P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, P dispersion of the patients was significantly higher than controls (37 +/- 9 vs 29.8 +/- 10 ms; P = 0.003). P minimum was not different between the two groups (P = 0.074). After surgical repair of ASD, 10 patients (29%) experienced one or more episodes of paroxysmal AF. Patients with postoperative AF were older (45 +/- 6 vs 30 +/- 10 years; P = 0.001), and had a higher preoperative pulmonary artery peak systolic pressure as compared to those without postoperative AF (51 +/- 11 vs 31 +/- 9 mmHg; P &lt; 0.0001). No significant difference in the pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio was observed preoperatively between the two groups (P = 0.56). P maximum and P dispersion were significantly higher in patients with postoperative paroxysmal AF at baseline and at postoperative first month, sixth month, and first year as compared to those without it (for P maximum P = 0.027, P = 0.014, P = 0.001, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively; for P dispersion P = 0.037, P = 0.026, P = 0.001, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). In addition, in patients with postoperative AF, no significant changes were detected in both of these P wave indices during postoperative follow-up. However, in the other group, P maximum and P dispersion were found to be significantly decreased at postoperative 6 months and 1 year as compared to baseline. P minimum was similar throughout the postoperative follow-up as compared to baseline in both groups.</str>
      <str>Mechanical and electrical changes in atrial myocardium may cause greater P maximum and P dispersion in patients with ASD. Surgical closure of the ASD can regress these pathological changes of atrial myocardium with a result in decreased P maximum and P dispersion. However, higher P maximum and P dispersion at baseline, which have not decreased after surgery, may be associated with postoperative paroxysmal AF, especially for older patients.</str>

These equations were applied to interpretation of a transport through polymeric membrane of binary nonelectrolyte solutions under concentration polarization conditions. The values of coefficients P(ij)* (i, j = 1, 2) were calculated for Nephrophan membrane and aqueous glucose solutions. From the calculations it results that the coefficient values P(11)*, P(12)*, P(21)* and P(22)* are nonlinear depend on a solution concentration (C) and configuration of the membrane system. Moreover, the values of coefficients P(11)*, P(12)*, P(21)* and P(22)* were compared to the values of coefficients H(11), H(12), H(21) and H(22), calculated for conditions of solution homogeneity for the same values C and varied configurations of membrane system. It is shown that a threshold value exists and when exceeded, coefficients relations P(11)*/P(11), P(12)*/P(12) and P(22)/P(22) depend on a configuration of the membrane system.</str>

      <str>This study characterized the microbial interaction of Peptostreptococcus micros and Prevotella intermedia, the major pathogens of dentoalveolar infection, using a murine model. Subcutaneous injection of P. micros cells in the dorsum of the mouse together with living cells of P. intermedia resulted in a significantly larger abscess when compared with single injection of the organisms (P &lt; 0.02). The abscess size was also significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) when the plate-cultured cell suspension of P. micros was injected into mouse with the culture filtrate of P. intermedia. The heat-treated culture filtrate of P. intermedia also enhanced the virulence of P. micros. P. micros culture filtrate did not affect the virulence of P. intermedia. Interestingly, the virulence of P. micros appeared to be enhanced even when the culture filtrate of P. intermedia was injected at separate sites in the mouse. These results suggest that a heat-stable product or products of P. intermedia increase the virulence of P. micros indirectly by altering the host condition, whereas living cells of P. micros can directly enhance virulence of P. intermedia.</str>

      <str>Since p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus is ameliorated by serotonin agonists and aggravated by serotonin antagonists, the effect of p,p'-DDT on serotonin metabolism in rat brain was examined. p,p'-DDT (600 mg/kg intragastrically) elevated plasma tryptophan as well as tryptophan and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in all seven regional areas of the brain assayed. Serotonin levels were elevated only in the midbrain and cerebellum of p,p'-DDT-treated rats. p,p'-DDT increased serotonin turnover in the medulla and midbrain. p,p'-DDT had no effect on the transport of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid out of the central nervous system, serotonin uptake and release from nerve terminals, or serotonin receptor binding in the brain. The findings in this study do not support a brain serotonin deficiency hypothesis as the explanation for the response of p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus to serotonin agonists.</str>

      <str>Cell-free extracts of D-fructose grown cells of Pseudomonas putida, P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. acidovorans and P. maltophila catalyzed a P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of D-fructose and contained 1-P-fructokinase activity suggesting that in these species fructose-1-P and fructose-1,6-P2 were intermediates of D-fructose catabolism. Neither the 1-P-fructokinase nor the activity catalyzing a P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of D-fructose was present in significant amounts in succinate-grown cells indicating that both activities were inducible. Cell-free extracts also contained activities of fructose-1,6-P2 aldolase, fructose-1,6-P2 phosphatase, and P-hexose isomerase which could convert fructose-1,6-P2 to intermediates of either the Embden-Meyerhof pathway or Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Radiolabeling experiments with 1-14C-D-fructose suggested that in P. putida, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. acidovorans most of the alanine was made via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway with a minor portion being made via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. An edd- mutant of O. putida which lacked a functional Entner-Doudoroff pathway but was able to grow on D-fructose appeared to make alanine solely via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.</str>

The mean levels found for herring muscle tissue related to wet weight (microgram/kg) were: 14 HCB, 18 alpha-BHC, 23 beta-BHC, 14 gamma-BHC, delta-BHC remained undetected, 56 sigma BHC, 115 p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT remained undetected, 84 p,p'-DDD, 51 p,p'-DDT, 250 sigma DDT and 530 PCB. The levels of organochlorine pesticides determined in wet muscles or extractable lipids of herring are nearly 2-3 times as high as those noted in fish sampled in the same area in two years before, whilst for PCBs the wet weight levels were comparable, and when based on a lipid weight are somewhat higher. The results are compared with levels found in herring collected in different regions of the Baltic Sea during 1965-1983, and reported previously by other authors.</str>

      <str>Cytochrome P-450 is the terminal oxidase of an electron transport system that is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a large variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds. This broad substrate selectivity is caused by multiple isozymes of cytochrome P-450 and the wide substrate selectivity of many of these isozymes. We have isolated 11 isozymes of cytochrome P-450 from the livers of rats (cytochromes P-450a-P-450k). We have found both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies increasingly useful to distinguish among these isozymes and to quantitate enzyme levels in liver microsomal preparations where as many as 15 or more cytochrome P-450 isozymes are present. Several of these isozymes show considerable immunochemical relatedness to each other, and operationally they can be grouped into families of immunochemically related isozymes that include cytochromes P-450b and P-450e in one family, cytochromes P-450c and P-450d in another, and cytochromes P-450f-P-450i, and P-450k in a third family. Immunoquantitation of some of these isozymes has revealed dramatic increases of over 50-fold in the levels of certain of these isozymes when exogenous compounds are administered to rats.</str>

      <str>Riverine phosphorus (P) concentration and P-transport to Lake Mälaren, the third largest lake in Sweden, has been monitored for 35 years in 12 major tributaries. During a period of 15 months, complementary assessments of particulate P, suspended matter and dissolved reactive P were made. Particulate P comprised 64%, dissolved unreactive P 23% and dissolved reactive P 13% as flow-weighted means, with high seasonal variability. "Background" or "reference" P-transports in the streams were estimated by different methods and the anthropogenic contribution to P-transport was shown to be reduced over time. Potential algal availability of particulate P showed a mean availability of c. 45% for water draining arable and forested land, while the availability was higher for sewage discharge particulate P and algal P. Calculated total bioavailable P in tributaries was shown to equal reactive P measured on coarsely filtered water and it was indicated that the proportion of bioavailable P was higher during the period with high anthropogenic P-contribution than with a lower contribution.</str>

      <str>The R-banded karyotypes of the different subspecies of Propithecus diadema and P. verreauxi are compared to each other and to that of P. tattersalli, as well as those previously reported of Indri indri and Avahi laniger. This comparison shows that the different subspecies of P. verreauxi possess the same karyotype and that, among P. diadema, P. d. diadema and P. d. perrieri share the same karyotype differing from that of P. d. edwardsi by one Robertsonian translocation. The karyotype of P. tattersalli differs at least through 17 and 9 rearrangements from those of P. diadema and P. verreauxi, respectively. This provides strong arguments in favor of its specific status. The phylogenetic diagram proposed confirms the early separation of Avahi and the relatively late divergence of the four other species. A populational evolution has occurred between these four species, P. tattersalli and P. verreauxi sharing the largest number of rearrangements (six), while the numbers of rearrangements shared by the other species are two for Indri and P. verreauxi, three for P. tattersalli and Indri, and three for P. tattersalli and P. diadema. No branch is common to two species of Propithecus.</str>

      <str>Polyphosphate buffering is a novel application of enhanced biological phosphorus (P) removal (EBPR) for P-deficient wastewaters with influent organic load variability. This study investigated the effect of biomass P content on polyphosphate buffering using a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and conventional bioreactor (CBR). Increasing the biomass P content increased polyphosphate buffering and the COD removal capacity, but at high P content (i.e. 20% P/TSS) the effluent P levels increased and a smaller fraction of available P was used for buffering. The MBR produced lower total effluent TSS levels and lower P levels than the CBR at both medium biomass P content (i.e. 12% P/TSS) and at low P content (i.e. 5% P/TSS) when the COD removal capacity was not exceeded. At high biomass P content, the MBR and CBR produced elevated effluent P levels. This study showed that the MBR does not make polyphosphate buffering feasible at high P content.</str>

      <str>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of hepatic microsomes from phenobarbital-treated animals was used to analyze electrophoretic/regulatory polymorphisms for cytochromes P-450b, P-450e, P-450g, and P-450h in 28 inbred strains of rat. Previous studies with outbred rats revealed the existence of four electrophoretic variants for P-450b, two for P-450e, and three for P-450h as well as two regulatory alleles for P-450g. With the exception of one allozymic form of P-450h, all of these alleles as well as a novel (null) allele for P-450e were found to be homozygous in at least two of the inbred strains tested. Eight phenotypes for combinations of these four cytochromes P-450 were observed. Inbred strains were identified that can be used in studies on the structure/function of unique cytochrome P-450-allozymes and in genetic crosses to map the four distinct cytochrome P-450 genes.</str>

No benzene hexachlorides or aldrin was detected [&lt; 1 part per billion (p.p.b.)] overall. Dieldrin and all DDTs (p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDT) were contaminated in the dietary fats (mean range 10-70 p.p.b.). Although dieldrin (4-58 p.p.b.), p,p'-DDE (65-196 p.p.b.) and p,p'-DDT (30-73 p.p.b.) were found to be accumulated in all the tissue fats and egg yolk fats, they were not detected in the dried excreta. Accumulations of o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD were found only in the liver fat (92 p.p.b.) and in the kidney fat (27 p.p.b.), respectively. In all the samples, p,p'-DDE levels were highest in comparison with the other compounds.

      <str>Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) omega-hydroxylase activity in human neutrophil microsomes was significantly inhibited by antisera against three rabbit omega-hydroxylase P-450s, lung prostaglandin omega-hydroxylase (P-450p-2), small intestine prostaglandin A omega-hydroxylase (P-450ia), and kidney fatty acid omega-hydroxylase (P-450kd). In contrast, the activity is not affected by antibodies raised against the phenobarbital-inducible forms of P-450s from both rabbits and rats. These findings suggest that the LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (P-450LTB omega) is structurally related to a group of rabbit omega-hydroxylase P-450s. The antiserum raised against P-450p-2 also inhibited the NADPH-dependent oxidation of 20-hydroxy LTB4 to 20-oxo LTB4 and 20-carboxy LTB4 by the microsomes, supporting that P-450LTB omega is able to catalyze the subsequent oxidation of 20-hydroxy LTB4 as well as the omega-hydroxylation of LTB4.</str>

      <str>The effect of adjacent bit-line (BL) interference on low frequency in 26 nm NAND flash memory was characterized. With the program (P) and erase (E) states of adjacent cells, current fluctuation (deltaI(BL)) and corner frequency (f(c)) of Lorentzian spectrum were changed. DeltaI(BL) due to RTN ranges from approximately 67.3 nA to approximately 45.9 nA with 4 different modes (P/P, P/E, E/P, E/E) of the state of adjacent cells and f(c) ranges from 48 Hz to 89 Hz. Using measured deltaI(BL) and extracted capture (tau(c)) and emission times (tau(e)) with 4 different modes, we calculated tau and f(c), and extracted the position of a trap in the channel width direction with deltaI(BL) and simulated data. The calculated data showed excellent agreement with measured spectra. Finally, we prepared energy band diagrams in P/P and P/E modes using 3-D device simulation and clarified the effect of adjacent bit-line cell interference. The control gate bias is slightly higher in P/P mode than P/E mode, and then trap energy in P/P mode is relatively lower than that in P/E mode, resulting in shorter capture time in P/P mode.</str>

(Prosthorhynchus) cylindraceus (Goeze, 1782) Schmidt &amp; Kuntz, 1966. The uncertainty of identification of a plover host of P. (P.) charadrii as well as the origins of P. (P.) cylindraceus (found in Australia but not New Zealand) and its occurrence in both bird and mammal hosts are discussed. P. (P.) menurae (Johnston, 1912) Golvan, 1956 is redescribed, including the male, and new host, Menura alberti Bonaparte, and locality records are given. P. (P.) allisonae n. sp. is described from Haematopus ostralegus finschi (Martens) and H. unicolor (Forster) from the South Island of New Zealand. P. (P.) allisonae can be differentiated from its congeners by having a proboscis armature of 18-23 rows of 14-20 hooks, thorns of hooks shorter than simple roots with short manubria, eight tubular cement glands and eggs of 134-154 x 33-36 microm in size. The presence of P. (P.) gracilis Petrochenko, 1958 in Australia is questioned. New host and locality records are given for Porrorchis hylae (Johnston, 1914) Schmidt &amp; Kuntz, 1967 and the northern distribution of P. hydromuris (Edmonds, 1957) Schmidt &amp; Kuntz, 1967 confirmed.</str>

      <str>Background. Malaria is a one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries. Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is usually thought to be causing benign malaria with low incidence of complications as compared to Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum). Methods. This retrospective observational study included malaria patients who were admitted to K.T. Children Hospital and P.D.U. Government Medical College, Rajkot, a tertiary care teaching hospital, Gujarat, western India, during the period January 2012 to December 2012. Inclusion criteria were patients in whom either P. falciparum or P. vivax was positive on rapid malaria antigen test and peripheral blood smear. Patients showing mixed infections were excluded from study. Results. A total of 79 subjects (mean age 5.4 ± 3.6 years) were included in the study. It consisted of 47 P. vivax and 32 P. falciparum cases. The P. vivax cases consisted of 33 (70.2%) males and 11 (19.8%) females while P. falciparum cases consisted of 14 (43.8%) males and 18 (56.2%) females. One patient of each P. vivax and P. falciparum expired. There was no statistical significant difference found between complications such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, liver and renal dysfunction, ARDS, and cerebral malaria between P. vivax and P. falciparum. Conclusion. We conclude that P. vivax monoinfection tends to have as similar course and complications as compared to malaria due to P. falciparum monoinfection. </str>

      <str>Aromatase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and cholesterol side-chain cleavage P-450 cytochromes (P-450AROM, P-450(17 alpha,) and P-450SCC, respectively) were immunohistochemically localized in nine granulosa cell tumors, 15 thecomas, ten Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, two steroid cell tumors, five fibromas, and five sclerosing stromal tumors. In the thecomas, P-450SCC and P-450(17 alpha) were positive in luteinized theca cells and in cells with vacuolated cytoplasm, while P-450AROM was not observed. In the steroid cell tumors, all the P-450 cytochromes were intensely stained. P-450SCC and P-450(17 alpha) were present in cells with vacuolated cytoplasm in two cases of sclerosing stromal tumor. P-450AROM was weakly demonstrated in one of the granulosa cell tumors. P-450(17 alpha,) P-450SCC, and P-450AROM were all faintly stained in the Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.

      <str>In order to investigate the intraspecific variation of Prunus yedoensis (Someiyoshino) and interspecific relationship among P. yedoensis, P. lannesiana (Oshimazakura) and P. pendula (Edohigan), DNA fingerprinting study was conducted by using two different kinds of probes, M13 repeat sequence and (GACA)4 synthetic oligonucleotide. In this study, 68 plants of P. yedoensis grown in 46 prefectures in Japan were investigated. All the P. yedoensis individuals investigated showed the completely same banding pattern, indicating their clonal origin from a single plant. On the other hand, each of P. lannesiana and P. pendula individuals investigated showed a unique banding pattern, suggesting a considerable amount of genetic variation in these two species. About 90% of bands in DNA fingerprints of P. yedoensis were detected in either P. lannesiana or P. pendula. This result supports the hypothesis that P. yedoensis is an interspecific hybrid between P. lannesiana and P. pendula. From those results, it is concluded that P. yedoensis was produced only once through hybridization between P. lannesiana and P. pendula, and that this particular hybrid plant has been spread vegetatively all over Japan.</str>

      <str>An evolved Escherichia coli-derived phytase was evaluated for its efficacy in improving growth performance and nutrient utilization of broiler chicks. One hundred forty-four 7-d-old male broiler chicks were grouped by weight into 6 blocks of 6 cages with 4 birds per cage. Six corn-soybean meal-based mash diets were randomly assigned to cages within each block. The 6 diets were adequate P (7.7 g of P/kg of diet), low P (3.9 g of P/kg of diet), low P diet plus 0.75 or 1.5 g of inorganic P from monosodium phosphate, and low P diet plus the evolved Escherichia coli phytase at 500 or 1,000 units/kg of diet. The chicks were fed the experimental diets from 8 to 22 d of age. The evolved Escherichia coli phytase improved weight gain (P &lt; 0.05), feed intake (P &lt; 0.01), percentage tibia ash (P &lt; 0.01), and retention of P (P &lt; 0.001), Ca (P &lt; 0.01), N (P &lt; 0.05), and a number of amino acids (P &lt; 0.05). The evolved Escherichia coli phytase was, therefore, efficacious in improving broiler growth performance, bone characteristics, and retention of P, Ca, N, and a number of amino acids.</str>

      <str>Dolichol-P- and dolichol-P-P-linked saccharides were isolated from several trypanosomatid flagellates incubated with [U-14C]glucose. Formation of Glc-P-dolichol and Man-P-dolichol was observed in Herpetomonas muscarum and Leishmania adleri, whereas only the latter derivative was synthesized in Trypanosoma dionisii and Leptomonas samueli. The main and largest dolichol-P-P-linked oligosaccharide formed in Trypanosoma conorhini, T. dionisii, L. samueli, Herpetomonas samuelpessoai and H. muscarum appeared to be Man9GlcNAc2, whereas in Blastocrithidia culicis it was Man6GlcNAc2. In L. adleri there were two main oligosaccharides linked to dolichol-P-P, Man6GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2. The The structures of the oligosaccharides were identical with those of the intermediates in the formation of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol in higher eucaryotes. It was concluded that similarly to Trypanosoma cruzi, Crithidia fasciculata and Leishmania mexicana, no glucosylated derivatives of dolichol-P-P were formed in the additional seven trypanosomatids studied here. The results obtained suggest that the defective step could be in some cases the formation of Glc-P-dolichol and in others, the transfer of glucose residues from the latter compound to dolichol-P-P-linked oligosaccharides.</str>

The determination of the amino acid composition showed that in one of the derivatives the epsilon-amino group of the Lys residue [epsilon-(P-pxy)-SP] and in the other the epsilon-amino group of the Lys residue and also the N-terminal amino group [alpha, epsilon-di-(P-pxy)-SP] of SP had been substituted by pyridoxal-P. epsilon-(P-pxy)-SP and alpha, epsilon-di-(P-pxy)-SP have spasmogenic activity with ED50 of 1.8 X 10(-9) and 4 X 10(-9) M, respectively, tested on isolated guinea pig ileum. The fluorescence of P-pxy residues permits detection of as little as 1 pmol/ml of epsilon-(P-pxy)-SP and 0.5 pmol/ml of alpha, epsilon-di-(P-pxy)-SP. Both analogues of SP obtained are degraded by human plasma more slowly than the native peptide.</str>

      <str>The effect of high pressure on the spectral properties of cytochrome P-450 LM2(Fe2+)-CO complex was studied. The application of high pressure was shown to induce the conversion of cytochrome P-450 to P-420. In the solution when P-450 was oligomeric only about 65% of the total converted to P-420. The remaining portion of cytochrome P-450 was stable at pressures up to 6 kbar. When P-450 was incorporated into membranes or when it was succinylated, the proportion of the pressure sensitive fraction was slightly higher (about 75%). Dissociation of P-450 oligomers into monomers was made by addition of 0.2% Triton N-101. Monomers were the most sensitive to pressure; they could be completely converted to P-420. These results have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of two different conformers of P-450 LM2, which differ in pressure stability. Splitting between these two states appears to be a result of the oligomeric organization of cytochrome P-450 in solution and in the membrane.</str>

      <str>Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) decreases infarct size after global or regional ischemia. Potassium channel openers also precondition but are subject to dose-limiting vasodilation. We compared the mechanical and electrophysiological effects of ischemic and pharmacological preconditioning in an isolated rabbit heart model.</str>
      <str>Rabbit hearts were preconditioned with either 10 micromol/L pinacidil alone (P-), 10 micromol/L pinacidil with 10 micromol/L phenylephrine (P+), or two cycles of global ischemia and reperfusion (IPC) before 1 hour of LAD occlusion. Left ventricular pressure, epicardial monophasic action potential duration (APD) and coronary flow were monitored throughout. Infarct size was determined at the end of reperfusion.</str>
      <str>Regional ischemia uniformly decreased APD (p&lt;0.05). During reperfusion, APDs were prolonged beyond preischemic values in all preconditioned groups (p&lt;0.05). P- and P+ reduced the incidence of fibrillation. P- significantly increased coronary flow (+15%, p = 0.001), whereas IPC and P+ did not. However, IPC and P- significantly decreased systolic function (p&lt;0.05) but P+ did not. In addition, IPC depressed diastolic function (p&lt;0.05) but P- and P+ did not. Infarct size was reduced by all methods (p&lt;0.05).</str>
      <str>Pinacidil presents a safe and effective alternative to IPC for preserving the heart during regional ischemia. Its coronary vasodilatory effects are safely and effectively reversed by the addition of phenylephrine.</str>

      <str>From 1947 to 1971 the world's largest manufacturer of DDT discharged process wastes into the sewers of Los Angeles County. Roughly 870-1450 t of DDT were released to the ocean off Palos Verdes, CA, a portion of which (approximately 100 t) resides in sediments on the continental shelf and slope. The most abundant DDT compound in the sediments, p,p'-DDE, is degrading by reductive dechlorination, but the rate of transformation and factors controlling it are not well understood. In order to estimate in situ transformation rates and predict the long-term fate of p,p'-DDE, box cores were collected in 1992 and 2003 from a single location on the Palos Verdes Shelf and analyzed for 8 DDT compounds and 84 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. The PCBs show no evidence of dechlorination, and inventories did not change between 1992 and 2003. By contrast, the inventory of p,p'-DDE decreased by 43%, whereas that of p,p'-DDMU, the putative reductive dechlorination product, increased by 34%. The first-order transformation rate for p,p'-DDE at the study site is 0.051 +/- 0.006 yr(-1). A multistep reaction model suggests that inventories of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDMU will continue to decline, whereas that of p,p'-DDNU will reach a maximum around 2014.</str>

      <str>Between the April and October of 1997, the sandflies in six areas (Centrum, Altinekin, Kadinhani, Cumra, Beysehir and Bozkir) of the Turkish province of Konya, in Central Anatolia, were surveyed. All the sandflies were caught close to houses, on sticky-paper traps placed in barns used by livestock. All 127 specimens of Sergentomyia collected were either S. theodori (86.6%) or S. dentata (13.4%). The other 2017 sandflies caught represented 12 species of Phlebotomus - mostly P. papatasi (78.4%) or P. halepensis (10.9%), with P. sergenti (3.8%), P. simici (2.2%), P. kandelakii (1.6%), P. similis (0.9%), P. jacusieli (0.5%), P. neglectus (0.4%), P. transcaucasicus (0.3%), P. syriacus (0.3%), P. kyreniae (0.3%) and P. balcanicus (0.3%) relatively rare. Most (87%) of the flies were male. This represents the first report of P. transcaucasicus in Turkey. In addition, P. syriacus, P. neglectus, P. similis and S. dentata have not been detected before in Central Anatolia.</str>

      <str>Some organochlorine compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), have a tendency to bioaccumulate in humans and predators at the top of the food chain. We have recently confirmed the transplacental transfer of these compounds and the present study has been designed on the same material with the aim of investigating their potential health effects on newborns from 70 pregnant women, resident in a Northern Italy industrial town. Organochlorine compounds [namely, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and PCBs] have been analyzed both in cord and maternal serum, placenta, and maternal subcutaneous adipose tissue by GC-MSD. p,p'-DDT levels in the adipose tissue resulted significantly (p&lt;0.05) related to birth length. Mothers of neonates born by preterm programmed caesarean delivery showed significantly (p&lt;0.005 for both) higher serum p,p'-DDE serum concentrations and p,p'-DDT levels in the adipose tissue, as compared to mothers delivering at term.</str>

      <str>The membrane transport protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an interesting candidate for individual differences in response to antipsychotics. To present an overview of the current knowledge of P-gp and its interaction with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), an internet search for all relevant English original research articles concerning P-gp and SGAs was conducted. Several SGAs are substrates for P-gp in therapeutic concentrations. These include amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, perospirone, risperidone and paliperidone. Clozapine and quetiapine are not likely to be substrates of P-gp. However, most antipsychotics act as inhibitors of P-gp, and can therefore influence plasma and brain concentrations of other substrates. No information was available for sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine. Research in animal models demonstrated significant differences in antipsychotic brain concentration and behavior owing to both P-gp knockout and inhibition. Results in patients are less clear, as several external factors have to be accounted for. Patients with polymorphisms which decrease P-gp functionality tend to perform better in clinical settings. There is some variability in the findings concerning adverse effects, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn at this point.</str>

Complexes bearing the tmiy ligands were shown to decompose in an analogous manner to complexes bearing monodentate phosphine ligands, with the rate of decomposition being nominally linked to the size of the chelate ring. The decomposition of these complexes in the presence of aryl halides-expected to yield Pd(Ar)X(P-P)-was studied and shown instead to yield PdX(2)(P-P) and [Pd(tmiy)X(P-P)]BF(4). Additionally, Pd(Me)X(P-P) and Pd(Ar)X(P-P) were observed in some cases. Intermolecular cross-over reactions between the starting complex and Pd(Ar)X(P-P) were found to be the source of these unexpected products.</str>

      <str>As previously reported, incubation of liver dolichol-P, UDP-[14C]Gal, and a particulate preparation of Acetobacter xylinum leads to the synthesis of dolichol-P-[14C]Gal (P. Romero, R. Garcia, and M. Dankert (1977) Mol. Cell. Biochem. 16, 205-212). It is now reported that upon incubation of the latter with rat liver microsomes, [14C-galactose]-Gal1Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol and [14C-galactose]Gal1Glc1Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol are formed. The galactosyl residues appeared to be (1,3)-linked in the same positions as the glucose units in the respective physiological compounds. No lipid-linked Gal1Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 was formed, thus strongly suggesting the presence of at least two dolichol-P-Glc:dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharide glucosyltransferases, only one of which is able to use dolichol-P-Gal as substrate. Incubation of the galactosylated dolichol-P-P derivatives with rat liver microsomes led to the transfer of the oligosaccharides to microsomal proteins. No endogenous, membrane-bound glycosidases were able to remove the galactose residues but mannose units were excised by endogenous neutral mannosidases.</str>

      <str>Concentrations of beta-HCH, HCB, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT and PCBs were determined by gas chromatography in 50 human milk samples collected from the general population during 1981/1982 in a continental town in Croatia (Yugoslavia). The samples were collected between one and 22 weeks after delivery from mothers breast-feeding one child only. The mothers' age was 18 to 31 years, and they were nursing their first or second child. All 50 samples contained beta-HCH, HCB, p,p'-DDE and PCBs, whereas p,p'-DDT was present in 37 samples. The concentrations of beta-HCH, HCB, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT and PCBs expressed on a whole milk basis were (median in microgram/kg): 11, 7.1, 67, 7.3 and 22 respectively, and expressed on a fat basis (median in mg/kg): 0.28, 0.21, 1.9, 0.18 and 0.62 respectively. The fat content was 3.7% (median). PCBs were present in a mixture containing penta-, hexa- and heptachlorobiphenyls.</str>

      <str>Rapid Response Systems (RRSs) have been widely introduced throughout hospital health systems, yet there is limited research on the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) following RRS activation. Using database extraction, this study examined the factors associated with ICU admission and patient outcome in patients receiving RRS activation in a tertiary level hospital between 2009 and 2013. Of 3004 RRS activations, 392 resulted in ICU admissions. Call factors associated with ICU admission and increased hospital mortality included tachypnoea (P &lt;0.001 and P &lt;0.001, respectively), hypoxia (P &lt;0.001 and P &lt;0.001, respectively) and having multiple Medical Emergency Team call triggers breached simultaneously (P &lt;0.001 and P &lt;0.001, respectively). Patients with seizures (P &lt;0.001) and tachycardia (P=0.004) were more likely to survive to hospital discharge. Patient factors associated with ICU admission included young age (P &lt;0.001) and having severe liver disease (P &lt;0.001). Factors associated with increased hospital mortality included delayed RRS activation (P &lt;0.001), increased age (P &lt;0.001) and comorbidities including ischaemic heart disease (P=0.006), congestive heart failure (P &lt;0.001), chronic kidney disease (P &lt;0.001) and severe liver disease (P &lt;0.001). Multiple factors relating to both the nature of the RRS activation call and patient characteristics are associated with ICU admission and hospital mortality post RRS activation. This information may be useful for risk stratification of deteriorating patients and determination of appropriate escalation. </str>

The mean levels found for cod livers related to wet weight (mg/kg) were: 0.096 HCB, 0.15 alpha-BHC, beta-BHC was found in trace amounts, 0.098 gamma-BHC, delta-BHC remained undetected, 0.26 sigma BHC, 1.1 p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT remained undetected, 1.1 p,p'-DDD, 0.39 p,p'-DDT, 2.6 sigma DDT and 7.2 PCB. The levels of sigma DDT, sigma BHC and HCB found are comparable with those noted in livers taken from cod of the same length class and netted in 1981, whilst-for PCB somewhat lower levels were found. Because of heavy contamination with PCBs, sigma DDT, sigma BHC and HCB the livers of cod caught in Baltic Sea still remain insuitable for human consumption.</str>

      <str>Eurycomanone, an active constituent isolated from Eurycoma longifolia Jack, was examined for modulatory effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 using in vitro assays. The IC50 value was determined to assess the potencies of modulation for each CYP isoform. Our results indicated that eurycomanone did not potently inhibit any of the CYP isoforms investigated, with IC50 values greater than 250 μg/ml. Hence there appears to be little likelihood of drug-herb interaction between eurycomanone or herbal products with high content of this compound and CYP drug substrates via CYP inhibition.</str>

      <str>Previous studies have shown that country income grouping is correlated with cigarette engineering. Cigarettes (N = 111 brands) were purchased during 2008-2010 from 11 low-, middle-, and high-income countries to assess physical dimensions and an array of cigarette design features. Mean ventilation varied significantly across low- (7.5%), middle- (15.3%), and high-income (26.2%) countries (P ≤ 0.001). Differences across income groups were also seen in cigarette length (P = 0.001), length of the tipping paper (P = 0.01), filter weight (P = 0.017), number of vent rows (P = 0.003), per-cigarette tobacco weight (P = 0.04), and paper porosity (P = 0.008). Stepwise linear regression showed ventilation and tobacco length as major predictors of ISO tar yields in low-income countries (P = 0.909, 0.047), while tipping paper (P &lt; 0.001), filter length (P &lt; 0.001), number of vent rows (P = 0.014), and per-cigarette weight (P = 0.015) were predictors of tar yields in middle-income countries. Ventilation (P &lt; 0.001), number of vent rows (P = 0.009), per-cigarette weight (P &lt; 0.001), and filter diameter (P = 0.004) predicted tar yields in high-income countries. Health officials must be cognizant of cigarette design issues to provide effective regulation of tobacco products.</str>

      <str>Eggshell thinning in ducks was induced by administration of p,p'-DDE in the diet (40 mg/kg food) for 45 days. This treatment resulted in a 19% reduction of the Eggshell Index (EI). Shells from calcifying eggs obtained at the time of slaughter showed a 36% reduction of EI. Prostaglandin synthesis by a homogenate of eggshell gland mucosa from p,p'-DDE-treated ducks was reduced by 24%. HCO3(-)-stimulated ATPase activity by a homogenate of eggshell gland mucosa from p,p'-DDE-treated ducks was not significantly changed. The calcium content of eggshell gland mucosa was increased to 127% in p,p'-DDE-treated ducks. p,p'-DDE-treated ducks showed profound changes in the shell gland luminal content of several ions. Calcium (-43%), sodium (-15%), potassium (-15%), bicarbonate (-33%) and chloride (-29%) were all significantly reduced in p,p'-DDE-treated ducks. The content of phosphate was unchanged. These findings are discussed in relation to a proposed mechanism for p,p'-DDE-induced eggshell thinning that involves inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in eggshell gland mucosa.</str>

      <str>The expression of perforin (P) in subpopulations of the PBL of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in stable and active phase of disease was investigated, by simultaneous detection of P (intracellular molecule) and cell surface antigens. A significant increase of CD4+P+ (p &lt; 0.02) and CD16+P+ (p &lt; 0.001), and decrease of CD56+P+ (p &lt; 0.05) cells in active MS was found. In active disease there is a highly significant increase (p &lt; 0.001) of average fluorescence intensity (AFI) for P in CD4(dim+) cells, and these cells are larger in size and have higher granularity (p &lt; 0.05) compared to CD4(bright+) p(dim+) cells. Surprisingly, there were no CD25+P+ cells in either group of MS patients. These results show that CD4+P+ cells are upregulated in active disease in cell number, in the level of P expression per cell, and in the level of cell activation (increase in cell size and granularity). It is suggested that CD4+P+ cytotoxic cells may play a role in the pathogenetic mechanisms of MS.</str>

      <str>The cytochrome P-450 family of enzymes performs an incredibly diverse range of detoxification and oxidation reactions within the cell and constitutes between 5 and 10% of protein in hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. In this report it is demonstrated that constitutively expressed membranous P-450s are targeted for destruction by the proteasome, in a process which is ubiquitin-independent and is demonstrated in vitro to require prior labilization of the enzyme. This process was specific for P-450s CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP3A, and CYP4A and was not demonstrated to be involved in the turnover of CYP1A1, CYP2B1/2, or NADPH reductase. In reconstitution experiments using purified proteasomes and microsomal fractions, labilized P-450 conformations are protected from 20 S proteasome degradation by substrate addition, with proteolysis occurring while P-450s are still attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.</str>

      <str>The effects of 2 weeks exposures of rats to 0.2 ppm O3 on pulmonary cytochrome P-450 isozymes were investigated. Two main types of cytochrome P-450 isozymes (cytochromes P-450FI and P-450FII) were separated from lung microsomes of control rats on an anion exchange cellulose column. Antibody raised against cytochrome P-450b, which is the main isozyme of liver obtained from phenobarbital-treated rats, cross-reacted with pulmonary cytochrome P-450FII, but not with cytochrome P-450FI. Ozone exposures caused increases in the content of both cytochromes P-450FI and P-450FII to the same extent two times greater than those of control rats without changes in immunological properties of these isozymes. No pulmonary cytochrome P-450 isozyme other than cytochromes P-450FI and P-450FII was observed in eluate through anion exchange column chromatography. These results indicate that increases in the content of pulmonary cytochrome P-450 of rats exposed to O3 can be ascribed to increase in constitutive types of the isozymes, but not to induction of other types of isozyme.</str>

      <str>Sixty-five samples of human milk obtained from individual donors living in Rome and surrounding areas between 1982 and 1984, and 28 samples from Florence and surrounding areas obtained during 1985 were analyzed for residues of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT and PCBs. Levels of p,p'-DDE were between 5 and 126 ppb (micrograms/kg of milk), with an average value of 45 ppb (median 34). Levels of p,p'-DDT ranged from 1 to 79 ppb, with an average value of 10 ppb (median 7). PCBs were found at levels ranging from 7 to 304 ppb, with an average value of 74 ppb (median 66). As to the p,p'-DDT, when compared to the data previously obtained in Italy during 1975-77, the present findings show a decrease of the average value and a lower incidence of samples with higher values. These effects are less pronounced for the p,p'-DDE. No relevant variation was observed in the levels of PCBs in comparison with the data obtained in Italy during 1981-82.</str>

      <str>Bymeans of this study, we have found out about the situation of Pseudomons contamination in the soft drinks which are manufactured and sold at the area of Nanchang City. In the course of this study, we examined total 416 specimens, in which we found that 69 specimens were positive reaction. The positive rate made up 16.59% of the total specimens. From these 69 positive specimens we separate isolated andidentified the following Pseudomonas 111 strains including 16 different species: P. aeruginosa, 9; P. fluorescens biovars; 11; P. putida biovars, 14; P. syringae pathovars, 5; P. mendocina, 5; P. alcaligenes, 23; P. pseudoalcaligenes, 10; P. cepacia, 17; P. solanacearum, 1; P. testosteroni, 1; P. delafieldii, 3; P. facilis, 6; P. flava 1; P. psenudoflava, 2; P. palleronii, 1; and a new species of Pseudomonas--P. halosensibilis. The achievement of this study will provide scientific basis for working out the standards of food safety control and inspection, raising the level of food hygieneinspection, and directing the drinks menufacturers and selling units to strengthen the food safety control and inspection.</str>

      <str>To evaluate the clinical and biological significance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), P-gp was detected in 169 patients including 152 previously untreated cases, 7 refractory cases, and 10 cases at remission by using monoclonal antibody UIC2 and flow cytometry. P-gp was expressed in 29% of previously untreated cases, being less than in 71% of the refractory cases. P-gp expression was not found in patients at remission. Morphologically, P-gp expression was high in hybrid acute leukemia (67%) and acute monoblastic leukemia (47%) subtypes. Immunologically, P-gp expression was significantly associated with CD34, CD7, CD14 or CD42b/CD61. Cytogenetically, P-gp expression was highly associated with poor prognosis abnormalities (54%), which was significantly higher than 7% of P-gp expression in good prognosis abnormalities. 23% of P-gp positive previously untreated ANLL (not including M3) achieved complete remission; this was significantly lower than 76% in P-gp negative cases. These suggested that P-gp expression is an index of poor prognosis in adult ANLL and P-gp positive ANLL has unique clinical and biological features.</str>

      <str>Recent technologies have resulted in an explosion of information concerning the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and increased awareness of life-threatening interactions with such commonly prescribed drugs as cisapride and some antihistamines. Knowledge of the substrates, inhibitors, and inducers of these enzymes assists in predicting clinically significant drug interactions. In addition to inhibition and induction, microsomal drug metabolism is affected by genetic polymorphisms, age, nutrition, hepatic disease, and endogenous chemicals. Of the more than 30 human isoenzymes identified to date, the major ones responsible for drug metabolism include CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and the CYP2C subfamily.</str>

      <str>Metabolism of the putative messenger molecule d-myo-inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P(3)] in plant cells has been studied using a soluble fraction from pea (Pisum sativum) roots as enzyme source and [5-(32)P]Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and [2-(3)H]Ins(1,4,5)P(3) as tracers. Ins(1,4,5)P(3) was rapidly converted into both lower and higher inositol phosphates. The major dephosphorylation product was inositol(4,5)bisphosphate [Ins(4,5)P(2)] whereas inositol(1,4)bisphosphate [Ins(1,4)P(2)] was only present in very small quantities throughout a 15 minute incubation period. In addition to these compounds, small amounts of nine other metabolites were produced including inositol and inositol(1,4,5,X)P(4). Dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) to Ins(4,5)P(2) was dependent on Ins(1,4,5)P(3) concentration and was partially inhibited by the phosphohydrolase inhibitors 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, glucose 6-phosphate, and p-nitrophenylphosphate. Conversion of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) to Ins(4,5)P(2) and Ins(1,4,5,X)P(4) was inhibited by 55 micromolar Ca(2+). This study demonstrates that enzymes are present in plant tissues which are capable of rapidly converting Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and that pathways of inositol phosphate metabolism exist which may prove to be unique to the plant kingdom.</str>

      <str>Cytochrome P-450 and the conjugating enzymes of the liver are the most important enzymes in the detoxification of xenobiotics. In order to get direct data in the Hungarian human population the activity of liver cytochrome P-450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, E1, 3A4) and of the conjugating enzymes has been determined in 11 Hungarian tissue donors died in accidents or in brain vascular catastrophe, by using specific enzymic reactions. In the activity of cytochrome P-450 enzymes a wide range has been found, a ten-fold difference being rather common. In the activities of conjugating enzymes the differences seem to be less.</str>

      <str>To identify the prevailing myths and misconception about vitiligo among the school students in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia.</str>
      <str>We conducted a cross sectional study in 18 schools of Qassim Regions in Saudi Arabia, Data was collected by 486 pre-tested, self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaires included a section on social-demographic information (age, sex, education of parents) besides prevailing myths on vitiligo. Data was analyzed by using SPSS (version 17 for Windows).</str>
      <str>THE RESPONSE RATE: Males 46.3%, and females 53.3%. With vitiligo disease: 24.1% and non-diseased 75.9%, with positive family history: Males 9.3%, female 13.8%. Myths among students compared with gender: Vitiligo with; Fish/milk food (P= 0.374), calcium deficiency (P= 0.001), iron deficiency (P= &lt;0.001), Vit C deficiency (P= 0.225), infectious (P= &lt;0.001), Chicken pox like disease (P= &lt;0.001), precancerous (P= 0.212) and not curable (P= &lt;0.001). Myths among students compared with diseased/not diseased, namely that relation of vitiligo with: Fish/milk food (P= 0.006), calcium deficiency (P= &lt;0.001), iron deficiency (P= 0.022), Vit C deficiency (P= &lt;0.001), infectious (P= 0.228), Chicken pox like disease (P= &lt;0.001), precancerous (P= 0.051) and not curable (P= 0.231).</str>

      <str>During a survey of the fynbos biome in the Western Cape of South Africa, 61 Penicillium species were isolated and nine belong to Penicillium section Citrina. Based on morphology and multigene phylogenies, section Citrina species were identified as P. cairnsense, P. citrinum, P. pancosmium, P. pasqualense, P. sanguifluum, P. sizovae, P. sumatrense and P. ubiquetum. One of the species displayed unique phenotypic characters and DNA sequences and is described here as P. sucrivorum. Multigene phylogenies consistently resolved the new species in a clade with P. aurantiacobrunneum, P. cairnsense, P. miczynksii, P. neomiczynskii and P. quebecense. However, ITS, β-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequences are unique for P. sucrivorum and growth rates on various media, the ability to grow at 30 C, a positive Ehrlich reaction and the absence of sclerotia on all media examined, distinguish P. sucrivorum from all of its close relatives. </str>

      <str>A simplified method that combines extraction, partitioning, and cleanup in a single step for measuring p,p'-DDT and its metabolites in fish is described. Minced fish samples are emulsified with disodium hydrogen orthophosphate and trisodium citrate, ground with sodium sulfate, and eluted from a chromatographic column prepacked with alumina and silicic acid. The fats and fatty acids are solubilized and easily extracted from the tissues and retained by the column, while p,p'-DDT and its metabolites are quantitatively eluted with 40 mL n-hexane. The eluate is directly applied to a gas chromatographic column. Average recoveries of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites added to fish in vitro are 81%. The average coefficient of variation for recoveries of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites is less than 6.5% and the detection limit is 0.001 micrograms/g for p,p'-DDE, thus making this method very suitable for residue analysis.</str>

      <str>Risk factor management is important in avoiding life-threatening complications and preventing new-onset diabetes. We performed a case-control study in 2013 at ten primary health care centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to determine the common risk factors of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and the demographic background of adult Saudi patients with DM2. Known diabetic patients were recruited as cases, while nondiabetic attendants were selected as controls. A pretested designed questionnaire was used to collect data from 159 cases and 128 controls. Cases were more likely than controls to be men (P &lt; 0.0001), less educated (P &lt; 0.0001), natives of eastern Saudi Arabia (P &lt; 0.0001), retired (P &lt; 0.0001), lower-salaried (P &lt; 0.0001), or married or divorced (P &lt; 0.0001). By univariate analysis cases were likely to be current smokers (P &lt; 0.0001), hypertensive (P &lt; 0.0001), or overweight/obese (P &lt; 0.0001). Cases were also more likely to have a history of DM in a first-degree relative (P = 0.020). By multivariate analysis, cases were more likely to be older than 40 years (P &lt; 0.0001), less educated (P = 0.05), married or divorced (P = 0.04), jobless/housewives (P &lt; 0.0001), or current smokers (P = 0.002). They were also more likely to have salaries &lt;7000 Saudi riyals (P = 0.01). Overall, prediabetic and high risk groups should be identified and counseled early before the occurrence of diabetes. </str>

      <str>Magnetic-resonance morphometry performed on 72 patients with major depression compared with 38 control subjects replicated previously reported, statistically significant reductions in the volumes of the caudate (P &lt; 0.03) and putamen (P &lt; 0.05) in depressed patients. Borderline statistical significance was observed for whole-brain (P &lt; 0.07) and frontal volume (P &lt; 0.10) in a subsample of 32 patients matched on age and sex with 32 control subjects, whereas statistical significance was observed for the full sample (P &lt; 0.007 and P &lt; 0.03, respectively). Chronological age was related to volume of the frontal lobes (P &lt; 0.0002), caudate (P &lt; 0.0001), putamen (P &lt; 0.008), thalamus (P &lt; 0.002), cerebellum (P &lt; 0.007), lateral ventricles (P &lt; 0.0001), and ratios of [whole brain]/[whole brain + cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)] (P &lt; 0.0001) and [frontal]/[frontal + CSF] (P &lt; 0.0001). Age of first depressive episode was related to putamen volume after accounting for chronological age (R2= 0.16, P &lt; 0.005), and a correlation of 0.26 (P &lt; 0.04) was observed between caudate volume and global mental status. Results are in accord with previous reports of basal-ganglia abnormalities in depressed patients and support the role of subcortical structures in mediating affective disorder.</str>

      <str>Microplots were infested with combinations of the fungus Verticillium dahliae and Pratylenchus penetrans and P. scribneri to test for individual and combined effects of these organisms on potato yield and nematode reproduction. Verticillium dahliae alone caused yield losses in all 3 years of the experiment, and the interaction between P. penetrans and V. dahliae was significant (P &lt;/= 0.05) in 2 years. Pratylenchus penetrans alone caused yield losses in 2 years and P. scribneri alone caused yield losses in 1 year. No two-way or three-way interaction was found involving P. scribneri. In 1987, reproduction for low densities of P. penetrans was 5 times higher when P. scribneri was also present than when it was absent, and 3.5 times higher in 1988. In nematode species mixtures, reproduction of P. scribneri was decreased by V. dahliae in 1987-88. The final population density of P. scribneri was negatively affected by V. dahliae and positively related to the initial proportion of P. scribneri to P. penetrans. In species mixtures with proportions of P. penetrans ranging from 0.1 to 0.5, reproduction of P. penetrans was negatively affected by V. dahliae and decreased linearly in relation to the increase in the initial proportion of P. penetrans in both years. The final population density of P. penetrans was affected only by V. dahliae.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter, controls the pharmacokinetics of various compounds under physiological conditions. P-gp-mediated drug efflux has been suggested as playing a role in various disorders, including multidrug-resistant cancer and medication-refractory epilepsy. However, P-gp inhibition has had, to date, little or no clinically significant effect in multidrug-resistant cancer. To enhance our understanding of its in vivo function under pathophysiological conditions, substrates of P-gp have been radiolabeled and imaged using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). To accurately quantify P-gp function, a radiolabeled P-gp substrate should be selective for P-gp, produce a large signal after P-gp blockade, and generate few radiometabolites that enter the target tissue. Furthermore, quantification of P-gp function via imaging requires pharmacological inhibition of P-gp, which requires knowledge of P-gp density at the target site. By meeting these criteria, imaging can elucidate the function of P-gp in various disorders and improve the efficacy of treatments.</str>

      <str>Cytochrome P-450-ALC, an ethanol-oxidizing form of microsomal cytochrome P-450 (P-450), has been purified from human liver. P-450-ALC (Mr = 54,000 daltons) is a low-spin ferric hemeprotein with a CO-reduced Soret maximum at 452 nm, and has an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence nearly identical to that deduced from a human P-450-ALC cDNA clone. In a reconstituted system, P-450-ALC oxidizes ethanol and aniline at turnover rates (12.2 and 7.3 nmol min-1, respectively) 10-fold greater than two other human P-450 isozymes (termed P-450-B and P-450-C) purified from the same liver. Both P-450-ALC and P-450-C effectively demethylate N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low substrate concentrations (0.5 mM), especially in the presence of cytochrome b5. Our results provide direct evidence for a liver P-450 isozyme in humans with catalytic properties similar to the related alcohol-inducible rodent P-450s and also reveal a new human NDMA demethylase.</str>

      <str>Reproductive-tract anomalies after administration of the potent oestrogen, diethylstilboestrol, in pregnant women raised concerns about the reproductive effects of exposure to weakly oestrogenic environmental contaminants such as bis[4-chlorophenyl]-1,1,1-trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) or its metabolites, such as bis[4-chlorophenyl]-1,1-dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE). We measured p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in preserved maternal serum samples drawn 1-3 days after delivery between 1960 and 1963. We recorded time to pregnancy in 289 eldest daughters 28-31 years later. Daughters' probability of pregnancy fell by 32% per 10 microg/L p,p'-DDT in maternal serum (95% CI 11-48). By contrast, the probability of pregnancy increased 16% per 10 microg/L p,p'-DDE (6-27). The decreased fecundability associated with prenatal p,p'-DDT remains unexplained. We speculate that the antiandrogenic activity of p,p'-DDE may mitigate harmful androgen effects on the ovary during gestation or early life.</str>

      <str>Cytochromes P-450 were isolated from the hepatopancreas of several species of crabs (Libinia emarginata, Callinectes sapidus, Menippe mercenaria and Uca minax). Elution profiles from an ion exchange column showed similar profiles for all species, indicating one broad cytochrome P-450 peak eluting at 0.2 M K Cl. Hydroxyapatite chromatography resolved the P-450 into three forms (cytochromes P-450I, P-450II and P-450III). The forms of cytochrome P-450 in the different crabs were compared with respect to their spectra and molecular weights. Cytochromes P-450I and P-450III from Callinectes, Menippe and Uca had slightly different spectral properties. The Soret peaks of the oxidized spectra had wavelength maxima of 414-416 nm, while the reduced spectra was 417-424 nm. The Soret peak of Libinia P-450II was 417 nm and 415 nm, for the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively. Molecular weights for cytochromes P-450I and P-450III ranged from 51,000 to 53,000. Libinia P-450II had a molecular weight of 49,000.</str>

      <str>This study investigated the prognostic value of preoperative breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) uptake measured by a semi-quantitative method in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).</str>
      <str>One hundred and sixty-two women with IDC who underwent preoperative BSGI were retrospectively enrolled. The tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (TNR) was measured on BSGI and correlated with histologic prognostic factors. The prognostic impact of TNR was tested with regard to progression-free survival (PFS) and compared with established prognostic factors.</str>
      <str>High TNR was significantly correlated with tumor size &gt;2 cm (p &lt; 0.001), high nuclear grade (p = 0.04), high histologic grade (p = 0.01), axillary node positivity (p = 0.04), ER negativity (p = 0.03), HER2 positivity (p = 0.01), and high MIB-1 index (p = 0.001). Among 162 patients, 14 experienced recurrence during mean follow-up time of 34.7 ± 14.9 months. In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, high TNR (p &lt; 0.001), high nuclear grade (p = 0.02), high histologic grade (p = 0.007), ER/PR negativity (p = 0.003 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), HER2 positivity (p = 0.01), triple negativity (p = 0.02), and high MIB-1 index (p = 0.02) showed a significant relationship with poor prognosis. Among them, high TNR was an independent poor prognostic factor in a multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.01).</str>
      <str>High BSGI uptake measured by a semi-quantitative method was correlated with diverse poor histologic prognostic factors and was an independent poor prognostic factor in invasive ductal cancer.</str>

      <str>Mini-open donor nephrectomy (MODN) potentially combines advantages of standard open (SODN) and laparoscopic techniques (LDN). This article is a comparison of these techniques. A literature search was performed for studies comparing MODN with SODN or LDN. Nine studies met our selection criteria. Of the 1038 patients, 433 (42%) underwent MODN, 389 (37%) SODN and 216 (21%) LDN. MODN versus SODN: Operative time (P = 0.17), warm ischemia time (P = 0.20) and blood loss (P = 0.30) were not significantly different. Hospital stay and time to return to work were shorter for MODN by 1.67 days (P &lt; 0.001) and 5 weeks (P = 0.03). Analgesia requirement and overall complications were less in the MODN group (P &lt; 0.001) and (P = 0.03). Ureteric complications (P = 0.21) and 1-year graft survival (P = 0.28) were not significantly different. MODN versus LDN: Operative and warm ischemia times were significantly shorter for the MODN by 55 min (P = 0.005) and 147 s (P &lt; 0.001). Analgesia requirement was greater for the MODN group by 9.62 mEq morphine (P = 0.04). No significant differences were found for blood loss (P = 0.8), hospital stay (P = 0.35), donor complications (P = 0.40) or ureteric complications (P = 0.83). MODN appears to provide advantages for the donor in comparison to SODN and also has a shorter operative time when compared with the LDN.</str>

      <str>Enzyme allomorph frequency and electrophoretic mobility were evaluated to clearly separate between morphologically similar sandfly species and to yield quantitative measures of their genetic similarity. Twelve enzyme systems were studied in laboratory colonies of Phlebotomus perniciosus, P. langeroni, P. papatasi, and P. bergeroti. Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. langeroni confirmed vectors of visceral leishmaniasis, were found to have fixed diagnostic allomorph differences at 3 enzyme loci (ICD-2, FUM, XDH). Phlebotomus papatasi, a known vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis and phleboviruses and P. bergeroti, a newly colonized suspected vector, were clearly differentiated from each other by a fixed allomorph at the MPI locus. Polymorphism at loci in these sandfly colonies ranged from 6.7% (P. perniciosus) to 43.7% (P. papatasi), with lowest levels seen in the older colonies. Expected heterozygosity was highest in P. papatasi, despite 33 generations of inbreeding, and comparable to that of P. bergeroti in its 7th generation. Against a scale of 0 for completely different, and 1.0 for identical genotypes, the enzyme data yielded indices of genetic identity (I) between P. perniciosus and P. langeroni and between P. papatasi and P. bergeroti of 0.783 and 0.737, respectively. These relatively high levels of genetic identity, paralleling similarities between species in morphology, inbreeding compatibility, and vectorial attributes, provide evidence of comparable and recent evolutionary divergence.</str>

      <str>In this study, two Pichia methanolica alcohol oxidase (AOD) promoters, P(MOD1) and P(MOD2), were evaluated in a promoter assay system utilizing the acid phosphatase (AP) gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScPHO5) as a reporter. Heterologous gene expression driven by the P(MOD1) and P(MOD2) promoters was found to be strong and tightly regulated by carbon source at the transcriptional level. P(MOD1) was induced not only by methanol but also by glycerol. P(MOD2) was induced only by methanol, although it was not repressed on the addition of glycerol to a methanol medium, suggesting that P(MOD2) is regulated in a manner distinct from that of other AOD-gene promoters. On the other hand, methanol and oxygen level-influenced gene expression mediated by P(MOD1) and P(MOD2). P(MOD1) expression was optimal at low methanol concentrations, whereas P(MOD2) was predominantly expressed at high methanol and high oxygen concentrations. Based on these results, both P(MOD2) and P(MOD1) should be useful tools for controlling heterologous gene expression in P. methanolica. In particular, it should be possible to differentially control the production phases of two heterologous proteins, using P(MOD1) and P(MOD2) in the same host cell and in the same flask.</str>

      <str>The occurrence of ciliates, especially the Paramecium aurelia complex, has not yet been studied in many parts of the world, or sampling was done only occasionally. Generally, the southern hemisphere still awaits investigation. In North America only the USA was studied in greater detail; the majority of species of the complex were there recorded. In Asia, more frequent sampling was performed only in Japan and Asiatic Russia. Europe was studied more carefully, however, a different number of habitats was studied in particular zones of Europe, the least in the southern zone. New stands of P. tetraurelia , P. sexaurelia, P. octaurelia, and P. novaurelia were revealed as a result of the present investigations carried out in Africa (Mozambique--P. tetraurelia, P. sexaurelia), Asia (Indonesia--P. sexaurelia), borderland of Asia and Europe (Georgia--P. octaurelia), and Europe (Macedonia--P. tetraurelia and Romania--P. novaurelia). Are climatic zones the main factor limiting the occurrence of species of the P. aurelia complex? Analysis of data on the distribution of the P. aurelia species complex in warm "tropical" zones on different continents may suggest such preferences for some species, including P. sexaurelia, P. octaurelia, P. tredecaurelia, P. quadecaurelia. The first two of these species were recorded herein in warm or "tropical" zone.</str>

      <str>Two different forms of cytochrome P-450, highly active in the omega-hydroxylation of prostaglandin A, and the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of fatty acids (P-450ka-1 and P-450ka-2), have been purified from kidney cortex microsomes of rabbits treated with di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate. On the basis of the peptide map patterns and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, P-450ka-1 was determined to be a new form of omega-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450, whereas P-450ka-2 is identical to P-450ka reported earlier. The first 20 NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (ALNPTRLPGSLSGLLQVAGL) and (ALSPTRLPGSFSGFLQAAGL) of P-450ka-1 and P-450ka-2 showed 90 and 80% homology with that of the lung prostaglandin omega-hydroxylase, respectively, suggesting that these three cytochromes P-450 are members of the same omega-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 gene family.</str>

      <str>The ability of sodium metavanadate to reverse the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on hepatic cytochrome P-450 isozymes was examined in male rats. Streptozotocin caused P-450h levels to fall 95%, and P-450j and P-450b levels to rise 8- and 40-fold, respectively, after 1 week. When diabetic rats were administered metavanadate in the drinking water for 7 days, P-450h apoprotein and mRNA levels remained no different from those of untreated diabetic rats, whereas levels of P-450b and P-450j decreased toward those of control rats. Metavanadate also lowered serum triglyceride and 3-hydroxybutyrate levels without lowering serum glucose in the diabetic rats. Furthermore, P-450h mRNA levels correlated well with levels of P-450h apoprotein for all treatment groups, indicating that P-450h suppression in diabetic rats is under pretranslational control and is independent of the increased expressions of P-450j and P-450b, and of the hyperlipidemia and ketosis that occurs in diabetes. Vanadate is capable of separating the effects of diabetes on expression of individual P-450 isozymes.</str>

      <str>A student's lifestyle can change notably in a foreign country. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with the body weight status of Iranian postgraduate students in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) 2009.</str>
      <str>A self-administered questionnaire was administered to 210 Iranian postgraduate students at UPM. Anthropometric factors also were measured using standard procedures. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) also were calculated. The chi-squared test, Spearman's rho, and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient were used to determine the associations between the variables that were studied. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to measure the amount of influence a predictor variable had on a outcome variable.</str>
      <str>There was no significant correlation between nutritional knowledge (P &gt; 0.05), weight-management knowledge (P &gt; 0.05), and smoking (P &gt; 0.05) and BMI. There were statistically significant correlations between gender (P &lt; 0.01), physical activity (P &lt; 0.05), protein (P &lt; 0.01), carbohydrate (P &lt; 0.01), fat (P &lt; 0.01), fiber (P &lt; 0.01), vitamin C (P &lt; 0.05), calcium (P &lt; 0.01), and iron (P &lt; 0.01) and BMI. There were also relationships between body fat (P &lt; 0.01), waist circumference (P &lt; 0.01), hip circumference (P &lt; 0.01) and WHR (P &lt; 0.01) and BMI.</str>
      <str>Our findings showed the need for a nutrition promotion program for the Iranian students to help them change their negative food habits and improve their lifestyles.</str>

      <str>We have shown previously that four of five white mutant alleles arising in P-M dysgenic hybrids result from the insertion of strongly homologous DNA sequence elements. We have named these P elements. We report that P elements are present in 30-50 copies per haploid genome in all P strains examined and apparently are missing entirely from all M strains examined, with one exception. Furthermore, members of the P family apparently transpose frequently in P-M dysgenic hybrids; chromosomes descendant from P-M dysgenic hybrids frequently show newly acquired P elements. Finally, the strain-specific breakpoint hotspots for the rearrangement of the pi 2 P X chromosome occurring in P-M dysgenic hybrids are apparently sites of residence of P elements. These observations strongly support the P factor hypothesis for the mechanistic basis of P-M hybrid dysgenesis.</str>

      <str>The study was conducted to investigate the changes in different fractions of phosphorus (P) and the relationship between different P fractions and their corresponding physicochemical parameters during organic wastes composting. There were distinct differences in the concentration of P fractions for the composts generated from different sources, highest in chicken manure and pig manure. The availability P (including water soluble P, Olsen P and citric acid P) declined from 44% to 36% in all composts, except for KW, following the thermophilic phase during composting, while moderately available P and non-available P increased from 48% to 59%. Different P fractions (inorganic P, organic P, Olsen P, water soluble P and citric acid P) were positively correlated with each other. The composts were clustered into two groups in our hierarchical cluster analysis. Conclusively, we suggested an optimized mode of composting based on the characteristics of the P fractions from different raw materials. </str>

      <str>To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among four species belonging to the genus Petaurista (P. alborufus castaneus, P. alborufus lena, P. leucogenys leucogenys, P. leucogenys nikkonis, P. petaurista melanotus, and P. philippensis grandis), we investigated the partial sequences (1,068 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for these giant flying squirrels. Phylogenetic trees (NJ, MP, and ML trees) constructed from cytochrome b sequences indicated that P. leucogenys was grouped independently with other species, and that P. philippensis was most closely related to P. petaurista with 99-100% bootstrap values. In addition, two subspecies of P. alborufus did not form a single clade: P. alborufus castaneus from China was most distantly related to the other species, whereas P. alborufus lena from Taiwan was closely related to P. petaurista and P. philippensis with 82-90% bootstrap values. This result suggests that it is reasonable to regard P. alborufus lena as a distinct species from P. alborufus castaneus.</str>

      <str>In 2008, mosquito observations were made in 4 populated areas of the Papsky District, Namangan Region, Uzbekistan (Fergana Valley), where visceral leishmaniasis cases had been registered. The mosquitoes were caught in Oltinkan, Gulistan, Chodak, and Chorkesar in July and in Oltinkan in September. A total of 7245 mosquitoes were caught in the living and utility premises during the observation period. The mosquito fauna of this focus was found to represent 10 species: P. papatasi, P. sergenti, P. alexandri, P. caucasicus, P. nuri, P. keshishiani, P. angustus, P. longiductus, S. grecovi, and S. sumbarica. It also contained P. papatasi, a vehicle for transmission of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, P. sergenti, an anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis vehicle, and P. longiductus, a visceral leishmaniasis one. The major site of hatching and habitat for mosquitoes were utility premises for large and small cattle. A polymerase chain reaction was used to determine mosquito infestation with L. infantum. A total of 38 female pools of 5 species: P. papatasi, P. sergenti, P. keshishiani, P. angustus, and P. longiductus were tested. Testing of female mosquitoes for L. infantum yielded a negative result.</str>

The latter represent the first examples of the eta(1)-P(basal) coordination achieved by the P(4)X(3) molecular cage. Further reaction of 2/3 and 5/6 mixtures with 1 affords the dinuclear species [[(triphos)Re(CO)(2)](2)[mu,eta(1:1)-P(apical,)P(basal)-P(4)X(3)]](2+) (X = S, 4; Se, 7) in which the unprecedented M-eta(1)-P(basal)/eta(1)-P(apical)-M' bridging coordination of the P(4)X(3) molecule is accomplished.

      <str>Long-term side effects of high doses of anabolic androgenic steroids self-administration were evaluated in this study. Twenty male bodybuilders, voluntarily starting steroid self-administration, were followed every 6 months over 2 years. Physical examination, haematological, metabolic and endocrine variables, semen analysis, hepatic and prostate ultrasound and echocardiographic evaluations were performed. LH values (baseline 3.43 +/- 1.75) were suppressed at 18 (1.98 +/- 1.99) (p = 0.026) and 24 (2.43 +/- 2.17) (p = 0.026), and FSH (3.95 +/- 2.01) at 6 (3.01 +/- 2.16) (p = 0.031), 12 (2.45 +/- 2.54) (p = 0.029), 18 (2.02 +/- 2.29) (p = 0.032) and 24 (3.42 +/- 2.64) (p = 0.032) months and SHBG (34.11 +/- 10.88) values significantly lowered at 12 (24.81 +/- 12.49) (p &lt; 0.05), 18 (21.28 +/- 11.15) (p &lt; 0.01), 24 months (25.42 +/- 11.16) (p &lt; 0.01). A significant decrease in spermatozoa count (p &lt; 0.01), and fertility index (p = 0.01) occurred. HDL-cholesterol (baseline 56.94 +/- 13.54) was reduced at 18 (41.86 +/- 14.17) (p &lt; 0.01) and 24 (43.82 +/- 18.67) (p &lt; 0.05) months and Apo A-1 at 12 (p &lt; 0.001), 18 (p = 0.05) and 24 (p = 0.05) months.

      <str>P wave dispersion is an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation. P wave dispersion is associated with inhomogeneous and discontinuous propagation of sinus impulses. The purpose of this study was to investigate P wave dispersion and transthoracic echocardiographic findings in elite women basketball players.</str>
      <str>We recruited 27 well-trained woman athletes with a training history of many years (11.9 +/- 3.6 years). All of the athletes were elite women basketball players and they were regularly maintaining sportive activities and training programs. Twenty-six age and sex matched healthy sedentary subjects consisted of control group. The difference between P maximum and P minimum durations was defined as P wave dispersion. The echocardiographic parameters were assessed in detail in the standard left lateral decubitus position.</str>
      <str>The body height, body weight, body surface area, metabolic equivalent, maximum P wave duration and P wave dispersion were increased in the elite basketball athletes as compared with healthy sedentary subjects. On the contrary; the heart rate, ejection fraction and interventricular septum thickness in diastole were decreased in athletes. The body height (p=0.006, r=0.37), body weight (p=0.04, r=0.28), body surface area (p=0.01, r=0.33) and heart rate (p=0.01, r=-0.32) were correlated with P wave dispersion.</str>

      <str>P wave indices and PR interval from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but their repeatability has not been examined.</str>
      <str>Determine the short-term repeatability of P wave indices (P axis, maximum P area and duration, P dispersion and P terminal force in V1) and PR interval.</str>
      <str>Participants (n=63) underwent two standard ECGs at each of two visits, two weeks apart. We calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), weighted kappa, and minimal detectable change and difference.</str>
      <str>ICCs were 0.93 for PR interval, 0.78 for P axis, 0.77 for maximum P area, and 0.58 for maximum P duration. Within- and between-visit Kappa were 0.30 and 0.11 for P dispersion, and 0.68 and 0.46 for P terminal force.</str>
      <str>Repeatability of PR duration was excellent, that of P wave axis and maximum area was fair, and maximum P wave duration and terminal force was poor. Repeatability of P wave dispersion was fair within visit, yet poor between visits. These results illustrate potential biases when measurement error of some P wave indices is ignored in clinical and epidemiologic studies.</str>

      <str>One hundred rotavirus strains detected in children with acute diarrhea in Blantyre, Malawi, between July 1997 and January 1998 were characterized for G (VP7) and P (VP4) types by using multiplex, heminested, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A novel P[6]G8 rotavirus strain was identified in 42% of the specimens. The remaining strains comprised P[8]G3 (20%), P[6]G3 (10%), P[4]G8 (9%), P[6]G9 (3%), P[8]G4 (2%), P[6]G4 (2%), and P[4]G3 (1%). Rotavirus strains with mixed G or P types were identified in 2% of the specimens. Nine percent of the strains were nontypeable with the primers used. The P[6] genotype was identified in 57% of strains overall. This first description of serotype G8 rotavirus as a predominant strain has important implications for vaccine development in Africa. The finding of novel P/G combinations (P[6]G8 and P[4]G8) highlights the extraordinary diversity of rotaviruses in some countries.</str>

The lithium salt of 4 reacted with thallium monochloride to produce ([Me(2)Si(mu-N(t)Bu)(2)P=S(NPh)-kappaN-kappaS]Tl)(7), which features a two-coordinate thallium atom. Treatment of 4-6 with AlMe(3) gave the monoligand dimethylaluminum complexes ([Me(2)Si(mu-N(t)Bu)(2)P=E(NPh)-kappaN-kappaE]AlMe(2)) (E = S (8), Se (9), N-p-tolyl (10)), respectively. In these complexes the aluminum atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by one chelating ligand and two methyl groups, as a single-crystal X-ray analysis of 8 showed. A 2 equiv amount of 4-6 reacted with diethylzinc to produce the homoleptic diligand complexes ([Me(2)Si(mu-N(t)Bu)(2)P=E(NPh)-kappaN-kappaE](2)Zn)(E = S (11), Se (12), N-p-tolyl (13)). A crystal-structure analysis of 11 revealed a linear tetraspirocycle with a tetrahedrally coordinated, central zinc atom.</str>

      <str>Platelet concentrates stored at room temperature deteriorate. The so-called storage lesion is characterised by morphological changes and a loss of functionality. To find an assay for early platelet activation in platelet concentrates the morphological score, beta-TG release and P-selectin expression were determined, and compared with the amount of soluble P-selectin. An ELISA was used to quantify soluble P-selectin in the storage medium. We found a significant correlation between the amount of soluble P-selectin and the percentage of P-selectin positive platelets (flow-cytometric analysis) (r = 0.7449; p &lt; 0.0001) or the amount of beta-TG release (r = 0.6837; p &lt; 0.0001). The morphological score also correlated significantly (negative) with the amount of soluble P-selectin (r = -0.7669; p = 0.0002). From day 0 till day 8, the amount of soluble P-selectin increased constantly from 219 +/- 49.2 ng/ml to 556 +/- 102.3 ng/ml. The detection of soluble P-selectin can be used to quantify activation of platelets during storage. The immuno-assay for soluble P-selectin is more sensitive than flow-cytometric analysis of the percentage of P-selectin-positive cells and allows earlier detection of platelet activation.</str>

      <str>Mitochondrial ATPases from rat liver and beef heart were used to study the effects of guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) and adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P) on the kinetics of MgATP, MgITP, and MgGTP hydrolysis. AMP-P(NH)P was a noncompetitive inhibitor of hydrolysis of all substrates with the rat liver enzyme, whether activating anions were present or not. Also with the liver enzyme, AMP-P(NH)P caused only MgATP hydrolysis to appear to have positive cooperativity. With the beef heart enzyme, AMP-P(NH)P was a competitive inhibitor of ATPase activity and caused positive cooperativity; it gave noncompetitive patterns with GTP or ITP as substrates. In both enzyme systems, GMP-P(NH)P gave complex inhibition patterns with MgATP as the substrate, but was a competitive inhibitor of MgITP and MgGTP hydrolysis. These results are interpreted as indicating the existence of two types of nucleotide binding sites, with varying degrees of specificity and interaction on the ATPase molecules from both sources. It is postulated that MgATP and AMP-P(NH)P bind to regulatory site while MgATP, MgGTP, Mgitp, and GMP-P(NH)P bind to the catalytic site.</str>

      <str>Axillary lymph node-negative (pN-) breast carcinomas (n = 281) were analysed histoquantitatively for two mitotic indexes (MAI, mitotic activity index; M/V, volume corrected mitotic index) and nine nuclear factors with special emphasis on disclosing prognostic factors during a follow-up of 12 years. The M/V index (P = 0.0018), tumour size (P = 0.0052), MAI (P = 0.0115) and histological grade (P = 0.0565) predicted the recurrence-free survival. MAI (P = 0.0007), M/V index (P = 0.0046), tumour size (P = 0.0133), histological grade (P = 0.0528) and S.D. of the nuclear perimetry (P = 0.07) predicted the disease-related survival. In Cox's analysis, MAI (P = 0.004), adjuvant therapy (P = 0.03) and tumour size (P = 0.09) predicted survival independently. Recurrence-free survival was related independently to nuclear perimetry (P less than 0.001), SD of nuclear area (P = 0.01) and MAI (P = 0.019) in Cox's analysis. In small (diameter less than or equal to 20 mm) tumours, S.D. of nuclear perimetry predicted recurrence-free survival (P = 0.03) in Cox's analysis. The results advocate the use of mitotic indexes and nuclear factors in place or in combination with conventional histological grading in predicting the survival and tumour recurrence in axillary lymph node-negative breast carcinomas.</str>

      <str>Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP1) results in release of eIF4E, which sequentially relieves translational repression and enhances oncogenic protein synthesis. We assessed the expression of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. In addition, we investigated whether phosphorylation site made a difference in outcome. Tissue microarray blocks were generated from 73 NSCLC samples and immunohistochemically stained for p-4E-BP1 Thr37/46 and p-4E-BP1 Thr70. Both p-4E-BP1 Thr37/46 and p-4E-BP1 Thr70 were more highly expressed in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma (P = 0.006 and P = 0.003, respectively). Expression of p-4E-BP1 Thr70 was higher in tumours with a diameter larger than 3 cm (P = 0.024) and nodal metastasis (P = 0.053). High p-4E-BP1 Thr70 expression significantly correlated with worse overall survival (P = 0.001) and was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 2.64, P = 0.004). p-4E-BP1 Thr37/46 had no prognostic significance. Phosphorylation site affected the prognostic significance of p-4E-BP1. p-4E-BP1 Thr70 is a candidate biomarker to predict poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. </str>

      <str>Serum concentration of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was observed in 54 parasitologically confirmed cases of malaria. Of them, 15 cases were Plasmodium falciparum with cerebral involvement, three cases with mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax, 32 cases of P. vivax, three cases of P. malariae and one case of P. ovale. Five out of 15 patients of P. falciparum (33.3 per cent), one out of 54 patients with mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. malariae (1.8 per cent) and the sole case of P. ovale (1.8 per cent) had fatal outcome. The serum TNF-alpha measured by avidin-biotin sandwich ELISA, was found to be significantly raised in P. falciparum and more so in fatal infections. The degree of parasitaemia, due to single or double infection, had positive effect on cytokine production. The mean TNF-alpha concentration was statistically significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in P. falciparum than in P. vivax parasites infection. The mean TNF-alpha values in P. falciparum and P. vivax were 915 and 280.6 against the values in normal healthy controls of 12.9 pcg/ml respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The study thus showed that the serum concentration of TNF-alpha correlated well with severity of malaria and these values could be used as an important prognostic marker of the disease.</str>

      <str>We report a retrospective analysis of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: incidence, recurrence, resistance, and subsequent disease of 81 children who underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The recipient and/or donor's CMV serology was positive prior to transplant [recipient (R+) and/or donor (D+)]. CMV was monitored by RT-PCR starting from the first week post transplant. Forty patients showed CMV infection (49, 5%). Of them 10 manifested CMV disease leading to four deaths. In univariate analysis, factors associated with CMV infection were CMV R+ P &lt; .01, CMV R+/D+ pair P &lt; .01, nonbone marrow (BM) stem cell source P &lt; .05, nonirradiation conditioning regimen P &lt; .05, Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) P &lt; .01. Factors associated with CMV resistance were: &gt;1 HLA allele mismatch P &lt; .05, CMV R +/D-pair P &lt; .01, CMV D-P &lt; .01, non-BM P &lt; .05, nongenoidentical transplant P &lt; .01. CMV disease was influenced by &gt;1 HLA allele mismatch (P &lt; .001), non-BM (P &lt; .01). On multivariate analysis, CMV R+/D- (P &lt; .05), corticosteroids ≥2 mg/kg P &lt; .01, ATG P &lt; .01 and non-BM (P &lt; .05) were independent factors for CMV infection. CMV R+ transplant is associated with more CMV infection and resistance to preemptive treatment. Prolonged immune suppression (IS) worsens outcome of CMV infection and should be shortened whenever possible. </str>

      <str>To investigate the prevalence and causes of blindness and partial sight among a population of Tunisian diabetic patients.</str>
      <str>A cross-sectional study of 2320 randomly identified patients with diabetes mellitus. Patient's characteristics as well as data from the last ophthalmic examination were reviewed.</str>
      <str>Of all patients examined, 60.2% were females and 39.8% were males. Mean age of patients was 54.5 years. Mean duration of diabetes was 7.6 years. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was recorded in 26.3% of patients, and was proliferative in 3.4% of patients. The prevalence of visual impairment was 22.2%, with 4.4% patients legally blind and 17.8% partially sighted. Visual impairment was significantly associated with age ≥60 years (P&lt;0.001), duration of diabetes &gt;10 years (P&lt;0.001), body mass index &gt;25 (P=0.014), hypertension (P&lt;0.001), heart disease (P&lt;0.001), peripheral neuropathy (P=0.03), vegetative neuropathy (P=0.002), macroalbuminuria (P&lt;0.001), cataract (P&lt;0.001), DR (P&lt;0.001), diabetic macular edema (P&lt;0.001), open angle glaucoma (P&lt;0.001), intravitreal hemorrhage (P&lt;0.001), rubeosis iridis (P&lt;0.001), neovascular glaucoma (P&lt;0.001), and tractional retinal detachment (P&lt;0.001).</str>
      <str>The current report is the largest study of DR in North African region. It provides a baseline data against which future progress can be assessed. Screening and treatment can greatly reduce the incidence of visual impairment due to diabetes.</str>

      <str>Remediation of pesticide-polluted soil is particularly challenging when pesticides in soil are aged and a mixture of pesticides is present. Application of zerovalent iron (Fe(0)) was investigated to accelerate the degradation of HCHs (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDX (DDT, DDE and DDD) in the soil from a former organochlorine pesticide manufacturing plant. Ultrasonic extraction was used extract the organochlorine pesticides from soil. The identification and quantification of organochlorine pesticides in the extracts were accomplished by gas chromatograph. The addition of Fe(0) facilitated the degradation of the beta-HCH isomer, but had little effect on the degradation of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and delta-HCH. Zerovalent iron significantly increased the degradation of p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT in soil, and the percentage degradation of p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT increased with increased Fe(0) concentration during the first period of incubation. However, the amount of p,p'-DDD, the main dechlorinated product of p,p'-DDT, basically kept increased except in the unamended soil. The addition of Fe(0) therefore did not increased the percent degradation of summation SigmaDDT (p,p'-DDT+p,p'-DDD+p,p'-DDE) markedly.</str>

      <str>The potential of performing photochemical studies in solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers, "photo-SPME", to study the photodegradation of p,p'-DDT and two of its major degradation products, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD, is shown. Analyses were carried out by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy detection. DDT was extracted from aqueous solutions using five different commercial coatings. The fibers were then exposed to UV light emitted by a low-pressure mercury lamp. After 30 min of irradiation, the degradation of DDT only occurred in polydimethylsiloxane fibers. The on-fiber degradation kinetics of p,p'-DDT was studied from 2 to 60 min. A large number of photoproducts were generated and their kinetic behavior was studied. In order to clarify the possible photoreaction pathways for DDT, individual water solutions containing p,p'-DDD or p.p'-DDE were prepared and photo-SPME was performed for each compound at different irradiation times. On the basis of the photoproducts identified, some photodegradation pathways are proposed. Finally, aqueous photodegradation studies followed by SPME were performed and compared to the photo-SPME. This work will show the enormous potential of photo-SPME to perform photodegradation studies.</str>

      <str>Substance P receptors were investigated in rat esophagus using 125I-Bolton-Hunter substance P as a labeling probe. Autoradiographic studies show that esophageal submucosa contains clusters of high-affinity substance P binding sites [maximum binding (Bmax) 4.2 +/- 0.28 fmol/mg protein; dissociation constant (Kd) 0.1 +/- 0.01 X 10(9) M]. The receptor distribution pattern is typical for submucous neurons. These data suggest that substance P may act as a neurotransmitter in rat esophagus.</str>

      <str>We investigated the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-GP) and metallothionein (MT) in a series of 92 GIST and 14 gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas (GILMS) with the purpose to expand our knowledge on the biological bases of GIST chemo-resistance and to ascertain their significance in patients' prognosis. P-GP expression was more frequent in GIST than in GI-LMS (83.7% vs. 21.4%, p&lt;0.001), with no difference between low- and high-risk GIST (p=1.000) or low- and high-grade GI-LMS (p=0.538). P-GP expression was unrelated to anatomic location (gastric vs. intestinal) in GIST (39/45 vs. 35/43, p=0.770) and in GI-LMS (0/2 vs. 2/6, p=1.000). MT expression was non-significantly higher in GI-LMS than in GIST (35.7% vs. 14.1%, p=0.060), with no difference between low- and high-risk GIST (p=1.000) or low- and high-grade GI-LMS (p=1.000). MT expression was unrelated to the anatomic location (gastric vs. intestinal) in GIST (7/45 vs. 6/43) and GI-LMS (0/2 vs. 1/6) (p=1.000 and p=0.1000, respectively). Overall tumor-specific survival (p&lt; 0.001) and disease-free survival (p&lt;0.001) were different in GIST as compared with GI-LMS, and the number of events was higher in GI-LMS. When the survival analysis took into consideration P-GP or MT expression, the overall survival in GIST was influenced by the expression of MT (p=0.021) but not by that of P-GP (p=0.638). However, in GI-LMS, P-GP expression influenced disease-free survival (p=0.050); in addition, it is important to recognize the limited value of these results because of the low number of cases involved in the study. Differential expression of P-GP and MT might explain the known variability in response to systemic chemotherapy in these tumors. Detection of P-GP and MT seems to add certain prognostic value in GIST (MT) or GI-LMS (P-GP).</str>

      <str>To evaluate the prognostic potential of the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), known to reflect the degree of tumor-associated inflammation and cachexia, in patients with vulvar cancer.</str>
      <str>We included 93 consecutive patients with vulvar cancer into our study. As previously published, the pre-therapeutic mGPS was calculated as follows: patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels (&gt;10 mg/L) and hypoalbuminaemia (&lt;35 g/L) were allocated a score of 2, patients with elevated CRP serum levels without hypoalbuminaemia were allocated a score of 1, patients with normal CRP serum levels with or without hypoalbuminaemia were allocated a score of 0. The mGPS was correlated with clinico-pathological parameters. The association between mGPS and prognosis was evaluated by univariate and multivariate survival analysis.</str>
      <str>Mean (SD) pretreatment CRP and albumin serum levels were 9.5 (9.6) mg/L and 41.4 (5.3) g/L, respectively. mGPS was associated with tumor stage (p=0.01), but not with lymph node involvement (p=0.4), histological grade (p=0.8), and patients' age (p=0.7). In univariate analyses, mGPS (p=0.006, p=0.001), tumor stage (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001), lymph node involvement (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001), and patients' age (p=0.04, p=0.007), but not histological grade (p=0.1, p=0.3) and year of surgery (1995-2001 vs. 2002-2008, p=0.7, p=0.3) were associated with disease-free and overall survival, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, tumor stage (p=0.01, p=0.02) and lymph node involvement (p&lt;0.001, p=0.001), but not mGPS (p=0.7, p=0.8), patients' age (p=0.6, p=0.4), histological grade (p=0.2, p=0.1), and year of surgery (p=0.4, p=0.8) were associated with disease-free and overall survival, respectively.</str>

      <str>A multitude of xenobiotics have been demonstrated to co-induce either cytochromes P-450c and P-450d or cytochromes P-450b and P-450e in rat hepatic microsomes. Recently, the compounds 2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (HCB) and 3-methoxy-4-aminoazobenzene (3-MeO-AAB) have been suggested as selective inducers of cytochrome P-450b (Eur. J. Biochem. 151:67 (1985)) and P-450d (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 133:1072 (1985)), respectively. Since the identification of inducers with such unique characteristics would have implications with regard to the mechanism of induction of all four isozymes, we have examined the induction of cytochromes P-450b and P-450e by HCB and cytochromes P-450c and P-450d by 3-MeO-AAB in liver microsomes from adult male rats. Immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies directed against cytochromes P-450b and P-450e indicate that HCB induces both isozymic species at the three dosage levels examined (10, 90, and 180 mg/kg). Similarly, 3-MeO-AAB does not appear to represent a unique inducer. Immunoblots of hepatic microsomes from animals treated with three different dosage regimens of 3-MeO-AAB demonstrate that, even at the lowest dosage level (50 mg/kg), both cytochromes P-450c and P-450d are induced. Moreover, immunoinhibition of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity by monospecific antibody against either cytochrome P-450c or P-450d confirms this result. 3-MeO-AAB increases this enzyme activity 10-fold; approximately one-third of this induced activity is inhibited with monospecific anti-P-450c, while two-thirds is inhibited with monospecific anti-P-450d. This study also demonstrates that hepatic EROD activity is not an accurate estimate of cytochrome P-450c content since the majority of this enzyme activity in control and 3-MeO-AAB-treated rats is inhibited with monospecific anti-P-450d but not with monospecific anti-P-450c.</str>

      <str>Hypokinesia (diminished movement) induces significant phosphate (P) excretion; however, little is known about the P deposition ability of the body during hypokinesia (HK). Using P loads, the aim of this study was to establish the deposition ability of the body to retain P during prolonged HK. Studies were done during a 30-d period of pre-HK and a 364-d period of HK. Forty male trained athletes aged 24.7 +/- 8.0 yr were chosen as subjects. They were equally divided into four groups: unloaded ambulatory control subjects (UACS), unloaded hypokinetic subjects (UHKS), loaded ambulatory control subjects (LACS), and loaded hypokinetic subjects (LHKS). All hypokinetic subjects were limited to an average walking distance of 0.7 km/d. Loading tests with 85.0 mg of calcium phosphate/kg body weight were performed on the LACS and LHKS. Fecal P loss, urinary calcium (Ca) and P loss, serum P, Ca, and the ionized calcium (CaI) levels increased significantly (p &lt; or = 0.05) in the LHKS and UHKS groups when compared with the LACS and UACS groups, respectively. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2 D3] levels decreased significantly (p &lt; or = 0.05) in the LHKS and UHKS groups when compared with the LACS and UACS groups, respectively. After the P load, significant (p &lt; or = 0.05) differences were observed between LHKS and UHKS groups regarding serum, urinary, and fecal P changes. Thus, the deposition capacity of P decreased significantly (p &lt; or = 0.05) more in the LHKS group than in the UHKS group. The deposition of P, fecal P, urinary P and Ca, serum CaI, P, Ca, 1,25-(OH)2 D3, and iPTH changed insignificantly (p &gt; 0.05) in control groups when compared with their baseline values. It was shown that after the P load, significant differences were observed between the loaded and unloaded hypokinetic subjects regarding serum, urinary, and fecal P values and P retention. The oral P load intensified P loss from the body. It was concluded that the higher the P intake increased the greater P loss and the lower P deposition and thus the less likely it is for the P load to benefit hypokinetic subjects.</str>

      <str>Neuroblastoma adenylate cyclase is activated by 2-chloroadenosine, prostaglandin E1, and 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate [GMP-P(NH)P]. However, the process of activation by the first two compounds is different from that induced by the third. Prostaglandin E1 and 2-chloroadenosine activation is rapid, producing elevated activities which are constant throughout a 20-min assay. In contrast, GMP-P(NH)P activation is slow and although the activity is elevated within 1 min, it continues to increase for up to 12 min before attaining a maximal constant value. Activation is more rapid when either prostaglandin E1 or 2-chloroadenosine is present with GMP-P(NH)P. Activation of the enzyme by GMP-P(NH)P appears to be retarded by endogenous nucleotides as suggested by the following observations: (a) if the enzyme is incubated at 30 degrees with 5 mM MgCl2 for 5 to 7 min, GMP-P(NH)P then produces maximal activation without a detect able lag; (b) if, during this incubation, nucleotides, a nucleotide regenerating system, or EDTA (instead of MgCl2) are present, subsequent GMP-P(NH)P activation is slow; and (c) in the assays which contain a nucleotide regenerating systm and MgATP as substrate, the Km for GMP-P(NH)P is 6 +/- 2 muM. However, in the assays using MgAMP-P(NH)P as substrate but no nucleotide regenerating system, the Km is 0.5 +/- 0.2 muM. GPD and GTP do not replace GMP-P(NH)P as an enzyme activator in any of our assays systems, and in fact, are potent inhibitors of GMP-P(NH)P enzyme activation. Prostaglandin E1 and 2-chloradensine do not alter significantly the Km for GMP-P(NH)P but do decrease the ensyme's sensitivity of GDP. Proposed is a hysteretic model of neuroblastoma adenylate cyclase, which shows the enzyme responding slowly to rapid changes in GMP-P(NH)P concentration due to the slow displacement of the tightly bound endogenous guanine nucleotides by GMP-P(NH)P. Additionally, prostaglandin E1 and 2-chloroadenosine increase the rate of GMP-P(NH)P activation by decreasing the enzyme's affinity for these endogenous guanine nucleotides.</str>

      <str>The deciduous dentition of the domestic pig is comprised of 28 teeth (2 x incisors 3/3, canine 1/1, premolars 3/3, molars 0/0). The timing and sequence of deciduous dental eruption were determined from oral exams on 233 Yorkshire piglets from 0 to 5 wk of age. Eruption occurred sooner in gilts for all molariform premolars (p(3), p(4), and p(4), P &lt; 0.01) and first incisor, i(1) (P = 0.004). Birth weight influenced eruption for all teeth except i(1) (i(1), p(3), p(3), p(4), and p(4); P &lt; 0.01), with heavier piglets having earlier eruption. Average daily gain in wk 1 of life was associated with earlier eruption times of p(3) (P = 0.006), p(4) (P = 0.001), and i(1) (P = 0.001), whereas ADG during wk 2 was associated with earlier eruption for p(4) (P = 0.036). The parity (P = 0.025) and age (P = 0.013) of the sow were associated with earlier eruption of i(1). No litter characteristics were found to be significant. Sequence of eruption was determined to be i(1), p(3), p(4), i(1), p(3), p(4), although polymorphisms (reversals) were found to occur in over 40% of individuals of both sexes for mandibular i(1) and p(4) and maxillary p(3) and i(1). Size of the left i(3), which is already erupted at birth as part of the needle teeth dentition, was found to be larger in males (P = 0.026). Body weight gain was not associated with the size of i(3). Eruption times of p(3) and p(4) (the first premolars to erupt) occurred later than previously reported in the literature. Because these teeth are associated with initiation of feeding behavior for miniature breeds, implications of molar eruption on feeding behavior and feed intake should be considered.</str>

      <str>The organochlorine insecticide DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) is still used for malaria vector control in certain areas of South Africa. The strict Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) allows spraying on the inside of traditional dwellings with DDT. In rural villages contaminated dust presents an additional pathway for exposure to DDT. We present a new method for the determination of DDT in indoor air where separate vapour and particulate samples are collected in a single step with a denuder configuration of a multi-channel open tubular silicone rubber (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) trap combined with a micro quartz fibre filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap section of the denuder concentrates vapour phase insecticide whereas particle associated insecticide is transferred downstream where it is collected on a micro-fibre filter followed by a second multi-channel PDMS trap to capture the blow-off from the filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap and filter combination are designed to fit a commercial thermal desorber for direct introduction of samples into a GC-MS. The technique is solvent-free. Analyte extraction and sample clean-up is not required. Two fractions, vapour phase and particulate phase p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT; p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDD; p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE in 4 L contaminated indoor air, were each quantitatively analysed by GC-MS using isotopically labelled ring substituted (13)C(12) -p,p'-DDT as an internal standard. Limits of detection were 0.07-0.35 ng m(-3) for p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE. Ratios of airborne p,p'-DDD/p,p'-DDT and of o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT are unusual and do not match the ideal certified ingredient composition required of commercial DDT. Results suggest that the DDT products used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) prior to, and during 2007, may have been compromised with regards to insecticidal efficacy, demonstrating the power of this new environmental forensics tool.</str>

      <str>A method is described for the separation and purification of different forms of cytochrome P-450 from liver microsomes of phenobarbital (PB)- and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC)-pretreated rabbits. It consists of solubilization of microsomes with cholate, followed by successive chromatography on omega-aminooctyl Sepharose 4B, hydroxylapatite and CM-Sephadex C-50 columns. Separation of different forms of cytochrome P-450 is achieved in the aminooctyl Sepharose and hydroxylapatite chromatograhy steps. This method permits the separation of three forms of cytochrome P-450, i.e. "P-450(1)," "P-450(2)," and "P-488(1)," from PB-induced microsomes; P-450(1), the main cytochrome P-450 component in these microsomes, and P-448(1) can each be obtained in a gel-electrophoretically homogeneous state, whereas P-450(2) can be obtained in a partially purified state. Application of the same method to MC-induced microsomes led to the purification of P-448(1), the main component in these microsomes, to homogeneity and to partial purification of a fourth form, i.e. "P-450(3)." P-448(1) from MC-induced microsomes seems to be identical with P-448(1) from PB-induced microsomes in monomeric molecular weight (54,000), amino acid composition and chromatographic behavior. However, P-448(1) from MC-induced microsomes, but not P-448(1) from PB-induced microsomes, contains 0.18 to 0.88 mol of tightly bound MC per mol of protein. P-450(1) has a molecular weight of 49,000 and its amino acid composition is clearly different from that of P-448(1). Although P-450(2) is similar in molecular weight, they differ from each other in chromatographic behavior. P-450(3) seems to be different from P-450(1) in molecular weight, though they are similar to each other in chromatographic behavior. All the cytochrome P-450 preparations can be freed from the detergents used in the purification procedure by CM-Sephadex C-50 chromatography. Detergent-free P-450(1), P-450(2), and P-448(1) exist in aqueous solution as oligomeric aggregates.</str>

      <str>Amine-functionalized mono- and diphosphines have been used to prepare a series of ruthenium complexes which exhibit a variety of coordination modes depending on the number of donors possessed by the ligands, the degree of amine methylation, the solvent system used, and the oxidation state of the metal. Reactions of the monophosphinoanilines, Ph(2)PAr or Ph(2)PAr' (Ar = o-C(6)H(4)NHMe, Ar' = o-C(6)H(4)NMe(2)), with 0.5 equiv of [RuCl(mu-Cl)(eta(6)-p-cymene)](2) in dichloromethane result in the formation of [RuCl(2)(eta(6)-p-cymene)(P-Ph(2)PAr)] or [RuCl(eta(6)-p-cymene)(P,N-Ph(2)PAr')]Cl, respectively. In refluxing methanol, [RuCl(2)(eta(6)-p-cymene)(P-Ph(2)PAr)] gradually undergoes chloride ion dissociation to afford the P,N-chelate, [RuCl(eta(6)-p-cymene)(P,N-Ph(2)PAr)]Cl. This chelate can then be deprotonated to afford the amido complex, [RuCl(eta(6)-p-cymene)(P,N-Ph(2)PAr(-))] (Ar(-) = o-C(6)H(4)NMe(-)), which is an active ketone transfer hydrogenation catalyst. Reactions of the diphosphines, Ar(2)PCH(2)PAr(2) (mapm) or Ar'(2)PCH(2)PAr'(2) (dmapm) with 0.5 equiv of [RuCl(mu-Cl)(eta(6)-p-cymene)](2) result in the formation of [RuCl(2)(P,P',N,N'-mapm)] or [RuCl(eta(6)-p-cymene)(P,P'-dmapm)]Cl, respectively, in which increased methyl substitution in the latter actually inhibits amine coordination with retention of the p-cymene fragment. Reaction of mapm with 1 equiv of [Ru(CO)(4)(eta(2)-C(2)H(4))] in dichloromethane initially produces [Ru(CO)(4)(P-mapm)] which, over a 24 h period with exposure to ambient light, is completely converted to the P,P'-chelate, [Ru(CO)(3)(P,P'-mapm)], by photodissociation of carbon monoxide. The same reaction with 2 equiv of [Ru(CO)(4)(eta(2)-C(2)H(4))] generates a mixture of [Ru(3)(CO)(10)(mu-P,P'-mapm)] and the mononuclear P,P'-chelate. The trinuclear complex can also be synthesized by direct reaction of mapm with 1 equiv of [Ru(3)(CO)(12)].</str>

      <str>The involvement of N-hydroxylation of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) by cytochrome P-450 in the formation of covalent binding of Trp-P-2 to DNA, the induction of his+ revertant in the Ames test, and the formation of the active metabolite were confirmed. Among four cytochrome P-450 preparations, PCB-P-448 and MC-P-448 purified from liver microsomes of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)- and 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats, respectively, showed higher activities for induction of mutation by Trp-P-2 than did the other two preparations, PCB-P-450 and PB-P-450 purified from PCB-and phenobarbital (PB)-treated rats, respectively. PCB-P-448 was more active than was PB-P-450 in metabolizing Trp-P-2 to N-hydroxylated Trp-P-2 (N-hydroxy-Trp-P-2). Cytochrome P-450 with higher capacity to form the N-hydroxylated metabolite induced a larger number of his+ revertants. Larger amounts of [1-14C]Trp-P-2 bound covalently to DNA were also seen when PCB-P-448 was incubated with calf thymus DNA and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate than with PCB-P-450 and PB-P-450. The direct binding of N-[ring-3H]hydroxy-Trp-P-2 isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography to calf thymus DNA was also demonstrated. These results indicate that N-hydroxylation of Trp-P-2 is an obligatory step for the covalent binding to DNA and mutagenesis of Trp-P-2. Based on these results, we propose that N-hydroxy-Trp-P-2 produced by cytochrome P-450 is important in the exertion of the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 as it binds to DNA.</str>

      <str>There is an inverse relationship between intracellular concentration of P(i) ([P(i)]i) in the kidney and maximum velocity (Vmax) of Na(+)-P(i) cotransport in brush-border membrane vesicles both in P(i)-deprived and growing animals. However, at any given [P(i)]i, the Vmax is substantially higher in growing than in P(i)-deprived animals. This suggests that growth and P(i) depletion act on P(i) transport via different mechanisms. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the nuclear magnetic resonance-visible phosphate and the Vmax of Na(+)-P(i) cotransport in proximal tubule-like cells [opossum kidney (OK) cells] cultured in vitro. OK cells incubated in 1 mM extracellular P(i) had a [P(i)]i of 1.1 +/- 0.2 mM and a P(i) uptake of 1.47 +/- 0.06 nmol/mg in 5 min. Exposure of OK cells to P(i)-free medium decreased [P(i)]i by 80 +/- 7% (P &lt; 0.01) and stimulated P(i) transport by 34 +/- 7% (P &lt; 0.05). Exposure of OK cells to 10(-8) M insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) increased P(i) transport by 25 +/- 8% (P &lt; 0.05) but did not affect [P(i)]i. The stimulation of Vmax produced by IGF-I was additive to that due to P(i) restriction. In addition, P(i) deprivation decreased the phosphomonoesters by 0.66 +/- 0.04-fold (P &lt; 0.05) and increased the phosphodiesters by 2.5 +/- 0.5-fold (P &lt; 0.01). Treatment with IGF-I increased both the phosphomonoesters (1.2 +/- 0.1-fold) and the phosphodiesters (4.1 +/- 0.6-fold). These results support the assumption that low P(i) supply and IGF-I stimulate Na(+)-P(i) cotransport by independent mechanisms.</str>

      <str>This study examined the link between terrestrial and aquatic phosphorus (P) speciation in the soils and sediments of a subtropical catchment. Specifically, the study aimed to identify the relative importance of P speciation in source soils, erosion and transport processes upstream, and aquatic transformation processes as determinants of P speciation in lake sediments (Lake Wivenhoe). Using a sequential extraction technique, NH(4)Cl extractable P (NH(4)Cl-P; exchangeable P), bicarbonate-dithionite extractable P (BD-P; reductant soluble P), NaOH extractable P (NaOH-rP; Al/Fe oxide P), HCl extractable P (HCl-P; apatite-P), and residual-P (Res-P; organic and residual inorganic P) fractions were compared in different soil/sediment compartments of the upper Brisbane River (UBR) catchment, Queensland, Australia. Multidimensional scaling identified two distinct groups of samples, one consisting of lake sediments and suspended sediments, and another consisting of riverbed sediments and soils. The riverbed sediments and soils had significantly higher HCl-P and lower NaOH-rP and Res-P relative to the lake and suspended sediments (P &lt; 0.05). Analysis of the enrichment factors (EFs) of soils and riverbed sediments showed that fine grained particles (&lt;63 μm) were enriched in all but the HCl-P fraction. This indicated that as finer particles are eroded from the soil surface and transported downstream there is a preferential export of non-apatite P (NaOH-rP, NaOH-nrP, BD-P and Res-P). Therefore, due to the preferential erosion and transport of fine sediments, the lake sediments contained a higher proportion of more labile forms of inorganic-P relative to the broader soil/sediment system. Our results suggest that a greater focus on the effect of selective erosion and transport on sediment P speciation in lakes and reservoirs is needed to better target management strategies aimed at reducing P availability, particularly in P-limited water bodies impacted by soil erosion.</str>

Crossbred steers [British and British x Continental; initial BW = 315.0 +/- 3.2 kg at location 1 (n = 27) and initial BW = 353.2 +/- 8.4 kg at location 2 (n = 27)] were used in 3 nutrient balance sampling periods (SP) at the beginning, middle, and end of the feeding period (154 d in location 1 and 159 d in location 2). Fecal N (g/d; P = 0.03), urinary N (g/d; P &lt; 0.01), urinary urea N (UUN; g/d; P &lt; 0.01), apparent N absorption (g/d; P &lt; 0.01), and SUN concentration (mg/dL; P &lt; 0.01) increased linearly as dietary CP concentration increased. Nitrogen retention (g/d) was not affected (P = 0.61) by dietary CP concentration. Phosphorus intake (g/d; P = 0.02), fecal P (g/d; P = 0.04), and urinary P (g/d; P = 0.01) increased linearly as dietary CP increased, reflecting changes in diet composition with increasing CP concentrations. As dietary urea levels increased, urinary N (g/d; P = 0.04), UUN (g/d; P = 0.01), and apparent N absorption (g/d; P = 0.04) increased linearly, but P intake (g/d; P = 0.10) and urinary P (g/d; P = 0.02) decreased linearly. No interactions were observed between SP and dietary treatments for most variables. Evaluation of SP means, however, showed that as days on feed increased, fecal N (g/d; P = 0.01), urinary N (g/d; P &lt; 0.01), UUN (g/d; P &lt; 0.01), apparent absorption of N (g/d; P &lt; 0.01), SUN (mg/dL; P &lt; 0.01), and urinary P (g/d; P &lt; 0.01) increased linearly, whereas retained N (g/d) decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.01) with increasing days on feed.

      <str>Treatment of anhydrous FeX2 (X = Cl, Br) with 2 equiv. of the sterically little demanding N,N'-bisphosphino-2,6-diaminopyridine based PNP ligands - featuring Ph, biphenol (BIPOL), Me, Et, nPr, and nBu substituents at the phosphorus sites and H, Me, and Ph substituents at the N-linkers - afforded diamagnetic cationic octahedral complexes of the general formula [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP)(κ(2)-P,N-PNP)X](+) featuring a κ(2)-P,N bound PNP ligand. With the sterically more encumbered N-methylated ligand PNP(Me)-Ph the related complex [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP(Me)-Ph)(κ(2)-P,N-PN(HMe)-Ph)Cl](+) rather than [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP(Me)-Ph)Cl2] was formed. This reaction was accompanied by P-N bond cleavage, thereby forming the κ(2)-P,N-bound N-diphenylphosphino-N,N'-methyl-2,6-diaminopyridine ligand. In contrast, with the N-phenylated ligands PNP(Ph)-Et and PNP(Ph)-nPr, despite small Et and nPr substituents at the phosphorus sites, complexes [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP(Ph)-Et)Cl2] and [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP(Ph)-nPr)Cl2] were formed, revealing that sterics can be also controlled by substituent variations at the amino N-sites. Depending on the solvent, complexes featuring κ(2)-P,N-bound ligands undergo facile rearrangement reactions to give dicationic complexes of the type [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP)2](2+) where both PNP ligands are bound in a κ(3)-P,N,P-fashion. In the presence of either Ag(+) or Na(+) salts as halide scavengers this reaction takes place within a few minutes. The pendant PR2 arm of the κ(3)-κ(2)-complexes is readily oxidized to the corresponding phosphine sulfides upon treatment with elemental sulfur. This was exemplarily shown for [Fe(κ(3)-P,N,P-PNP-nPr)(κ(2)-P,N-PNS-nPr)Cl](+).

      <str>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and decrease brain compliance (BC). Different injuries are applied to TBI models studying the same variables. Since they are indistinctly used, the objective was to compare ICP and BC in two different TBI models.</str>
      <str>This study involved 18 male dogs anesthetized, ventilated and randomly distributed in two groups: SB - subdural balloon (n = 9) and CI - cryogenic injury (n = 9). ICP, BC and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were evaluated in five moments: end of preparation (M0), normal brain (M1), beginning of injury (M2), end of injury (M3) and established injury (M4). BC is ICP variation during induced hypertension (IH) in 50 mmHg in M1 and M4. CPP = Mean Blood Pressure (MBP) - ICP. Paired Student's t test was used for the same group in different moments and Student's t test was used for two different samples in the same moment between groups.</str>
      <str>MBP was similar for both groups in all studied moments (p = 0.31 in M0; p = 0.25 in M1; p = 0.31 in M2; p = 0.19 in M3; p = 0.05 in M4). ICP was similar between groups in M0 (p = 0.27) and M1 (p = 0.21), however different in M2 (p &lt; 0.001). ICP was similar for both groups in M3 (p = 0.39) and M4 (p = 0.98), increased for SB in M1 (p = 0.04) and M2 (p = 0.01), but not in M3 (p = 0.36) and M4 (p = 0.12). For CI, ICP has increased in M1 (p &lt; 0.01), M3 (p &lt; 0.001) and M4 (p &lt; 0.001), but not in M2 (p = 0.18). There has been CPP increase in M1 (p &lt; 0.001) and M4 (p &lt; 0.001), with no difference between groups (p = 0.16 in M1 and p = 0.21 in M4). There has been decreased CPP in M2 for both groups (p &lt; 0.001), however more severe for CI (p &lt; 0.001). In M3, there has been increased CPP for SB (p = 0.02) and decreased CPP for CI (p = 0.01), what has made CPP similar for both groups (p = 0.43). CPP has equally increased in M4 for both groups (p = 0.16).</str>
      <str>Induced hypertension (IH) effect on CI model is comparable to what has been observed in the SB model. This type of injury should be better studied to establish precision in the ratio between injury extension and BC decrease, which seems to be a gradual and evolving process, with not totally understood limits.</str>

      <str>Acid aspiration syndrome of induction of anesthesia is a life-threatening complication whose severity is affected by both pH and volume of the aspirated gastric juice. We compared the effects of two proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), lansoprazole and omeprazole, and an H2 blocker, ranitidine, on gastric secretion in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion in 200 adult patients of ASA physical status I undergoing elective surgery. The patients were divided into eight groups (n = 25 each) according to their premedication. The patients received lansoprazole-lansoprazole (Group L-L), lansoprazole-placebo (Group L-P), placebo-lansoprazole (Group P-L), omeprazole-omeprazole (Group O-O), omeprazole-placebo (Group O-P), placebo-omeprazole (Group P-O), placebo-ranitidine (Group P-R), or placebo-placebo (Group P-P), as the first and second medications. The dose of the study drug was 30 mg for lansoprazole, 150 mg for ranitidine, and 80 mg for omeprazole. The first medication was administered orally at 9:00 PM on the night before surgery and the second at 5:30 AM in the morning on the day of the surgery. Each patient fasted overnight and took the drug with 20 mL of water. After tracheal intubation, gastric fluid was aspirated via an orogastric tube and the volume and pH of the aspirate were measured. The pH of the aspirated gastric fluid was higher in Groups P-R, L-L, P-L, O-O, and O-P than in Group P-P (P &lt; 0.05). The volume of the gastric contents was similar in Groups P-0 and P-P, and the other groups had smaller gastric volume than Group P-P (P &lt; 0.05). Gastric fluid from patients in Group P-R was the least acidic (pH 6.1 +/- 1.2) and had the least volume (0.09 +/- 0.06 mL/kg). Group L-L was comparable with Group P-R in both pH and volume, whereas Groups P-L and O-O were similar to Group P-R only in volume. The proportion of patients at risk according to the traditional criteria (pH &lt; 2.5 and volume 0.4 mL/kg) was significantly lower in Groups L-L (0%), P-L (4%), O-O (4%), and P-R (0%) than in Group P-P (48%) (P &lt; 0.05). We concluded that two consecutive doses of lansoprazole or a morning dose of ranitidine seemed to be the most effective preanesthetic medication for reducing gastric acidity and volume.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study was to examine whether in vivo drug distribution to the brain can be reconstructed by integrating P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/mdr1a expression levels, P-gp in vitro activity, and drug unbound fractions in mouse plasma and brain. For 11 P-gp substrates, in vitro P-gp transport activities were determined by measuring transcellular transport across monolayers of mouse P-gp-transfected LLC-PK1 (L-mdr1a) and parental cells. P-gp expression amounts were determined by quantitative targeted absolute proteomics. Unbound drug fractions in plasma and brain were obtained from the literature and by measuring brain slice uptake, respectively. Brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (K(p brain)) and its ratios between wild-type and mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice (K(p brain) ratio) were obtained from the literature or determined by intravenous constant infusion. Unbound brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (K(p,uu,brain)) were estimated from K(p brain) and unbound fractions. Based on pharmacokinetic theory, K(p brain) ratios were reconstructed from in vitro P-gp transport activities and P-gp expression amounts in L-mdr1a cells and mouse brain capillaries. All reconstructed K(p brain) ratios were within a 1.6-fold range of observed values. K(p brain) then was reconstructed from the reconstructed K(p brain) ratios and unbound fractions. K(p,uu,brain) was reconstructed as the reciprocal of the reconstructed K(p brain) ratios. For quinidine, loperamide, risperidone, indinavir, dexamethasone, paclitaxel, verapamil, loratadine, and diazepam, the reconstructed K(p brain) and K(p,uu,brain) agreed with observed and estimated in vivo values within a 3-fold range, respectively. Thus, brain distributions of P-gp substrates can be reconstructed from P-gp expression levels, in vitro activity, and drug unbound fractions.</str>

      <str>The specificity of Man-P-Dol:Man5-8GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol (Oligo-P-P-Dol) mannosyltransferase activity in pig brain was investigated by comparing a variety of mannosylphosphorylisoprenols as mannosyl donors. For this comparison the beta-Man-P-isoprenols were synthesized using a partially purified preparation of mannosylphosphorylundecaprenol (Man-P-Undec) synthase from Micrococcus luteus. The bacterial mannosyltransferase efficiently catalyzed the transfer of mannose from GDP-[3H]Man to a series of defined isoprenyl monophosphate substrates. Two alpha-Man-P-dolichols were synthesized chemically and also examined as substrates. When exogenous beta-[3H]Man-P-Dol95 was tested as a substrate for Man-P-Dol:Oligo-P-P-Dol mannosyltransferase activity in pig brain microsomes, [3H]mannose was actively transferred to endogenous Oligo-P-P-Dol acceptors. The major enzymatically labeled product was Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol. Under identical conditions beta-[3H]mannosylphosphorylpolyprenol (Man-P-Poly95) was an extremely poor substrate, indicating that the saturated alpha-isoprene unit of the dolichyl moiety is critical for recognition of the lipophilic mannosyl donor by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated mannosyltransferase(s). When Man-P-dolichols containing 2, 11, or 19 isoprene units were compared, the initial rates for the mannosyl transfer reactions and the affinity of the enzyme(s) for the mannophospholipid substrate increased with the length and hydrophobicity of the polyisoprenol chain. The anomeric configuration of the mannosyl moiety is apparently essential because the brain mannosyltransferases exhibited a strong preference for beta-Man-P-dolichols over the corresponding chemically synthesized alpha-stereoisomers. These results: 1) describe a simple two-step procedure for obtaining a partially purified preparation of Man-P-Undec synthase that efficiently synthesizes a variety of beta-Man-P-isoprenols; 2) indicate that pig brain Man-P-Dol:Oligo-P-P-Dol mannosyltransferase activity is relatively specific for lipophilic mannosyl donors containing 19 isoprene units with a beta-Man 1-P group attached to the saturated alpha-isoprene unit of dolichol; and 3) emphasize the importance of the reduction of the alpha-isoprene unit in the biosynthesis and function of Dol-P in mammalian cells.</str>

      <str>The Pauropsalta annulata Goding &amp; Froggatt species group is distributed (widely) in eastern Australia. This group com-prises P. annulata, P. rubristrigata (Goding and Froggatt) and P. ayrensis Ewart, with P. annulata sens. lat. containing the greatest diversity in calling songs, ecology and distribution. Previous studies have revealed that this diversity is due to the presence of several cryptic species, which together make up the Pauropsalta annulata species complex. The present study provides a revision of the Pauropsalta annulata species group and includes redescriptions of P. annulata s.str., P. rubristrigata (Goding &amp; Froggatt) and P. ayrensis Ewart, as well as descriptions of 11 species new to science: P. blackdownensis sp. nov., P. corymbiae sp. nov., P. decora sp. nov., P. granitica sp. nov., P. inversa sp. nov., P. kobongoides sp. nov., P. notialis sp. nov., P. simplex sp. nov., P. subtropica sp. nov., P. torrensis sp. nov. and P. tremula sp. nov. In addition, two new subspecies are also described: P. n. notialis subsp. nov. and P. n. incitata subsp. nov., along with extensive areas of hybridisation, which justifies their subspecific status. Within the P. annulata species group, the P. annulata species complex is redefined to contain P. annulata s. str., P. notialis sp. nov. and P. tremula sp. nov. These species have a number of apomorphies in common and are expected to have had a single point of origin (i.e. represent a monophyletic group). To facilitate the identification of taxa in the P. annulata species group, separate keys are provided for specimens and field recordings based on morphology and calling song structure respectively. Morphological descriptions or diagnoses and descriptions of calling song structure are provided for each species and subspecies (and the hybrids between the subspecies). The descriptions are followed by a comprehensive statistical analysis of calling song specificity in the P. annulata species complex. A preliminary molecular phylogenetic analysis, focusing on species-level relationships and divergence times within the P. annulata species group, is also included.</str>

      <str>Sodium cholate, Emulgen 911, and (3-[(-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) (CHAPS) were selected to examine the effects of ionic, nonionic, and zwitterionic detergents on testosterone hydroxylation catalyzed by four purified isozymes of rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, namely P-450a, P-450b, P-450c, and P-450h, in reconstituted systems containing optimal amounts of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine and saturating amounts of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (reductase). The major phenobarbital-inducible form of rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, designated P-450b, was extremely sensitive to the inhibitory effects of Emulgen 911, which is used in several procedures to purify this and other forms of cytochrome P-450. In contrast, sodium cholate and CHAPS had little effect on the catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450b, even at ten times the concentration of Emulgen 911 effecting 50% inhibition (IC-50). By substituting the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS for Emulgen 911, we purified cytochrome P-450b without the use of nonionic detergent. The protein is designated cytochrome P-450b* to distinguish it from cytochrome P-450b purified with the use of Emulgen 911. NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was also purified both with and without the use of nonionic detergent. The absolute spectra of cytochrome P-450b and P-450b* were indistinguishable, as were the carbon monoxide (CO)- and metyrapone-difference spectra of the dithionite-reduced hemoproteins. When reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, cytochromes P-450b and P-450b* catalyzed the N-demethylation of benzphetamine and aminopyrine, the 4-hydroxylation of aniline, the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin, the 3-hydroxylation of hexobarbital, and the 6-hydroxylation of zoxazolamine. Both hemoproteins catalyzed the 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone, as well as the 17-oxidation of testosterone to androstenedione. Both hemoproteins were poor catalysts of erythromycin demethylation and benzo[a]pyrene 3-/9-hydroxylation. The rate of biotransformation catalyzed by cytochrome P-450b* was up to 50% greater than the rate catalyzed by cytochrome P-450b when reconstituted with either reductase or reductase*. The activity of cytochrome P-450b and P-450b* increased up to 50% when reconstituted with reductase* instead of reductase. In addition to establishing the feasibility of purifying an isozyme of rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 without the use of nonionic detergent, these results indicate that the catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450 is not unduly compromised by residual contamination with the nonionic detergent Emulgen 911.</str>

      <str>Active absorption in the intestine and metabolism of the beta- and alpha-anomers of the glucoside and galactoside of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) were studied to find a more suitable prodrug for poorly absorbed drugs. The everted sac technique was used to investigate the intestinal absorption of these glycosides at 250 microM from the mucosal to the serosal side in the rat jejunum. The absorption clearance of p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside (p-NP alpha glc) (0.271 +/- 0.089 microL/min/cm, mean +/- SE, N = 8) was much lower than that of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (p-NP beta glc) (4.45 +/- 0.34 microL/min/cm, mean +/- SE, N = 4) which is actively absorbed by a glucose transport carrier [Mizuma et al., Biochem Pharmacol 43: 2037-2039, 1992]. However, the major constituent appearing on the serosal side was p-NP (aglycone) after absorption of pNP alpha glc, whereas it was p-NP beta glc itself after absorption of p-NP beta glc. The total amount transported to the serosal side after 20 min of p-NP alpha glc absorption, which was similar to that of p-NP beta glc, was significantly decreased in the absence of Na+, indicating the active absorption of p-NP alpha glc by a Na(+)-dependent glucose transport carrier. Perfusion with a mucosal solution of p-NP alpha glc showed that the p-NP concentration on the serosal side (15.8 +/- 1.56 microM, mean +/- SE, N = 3) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that on the mucosal side (5.84 +/- 1.24 microM, mean +/- SE, N = 3) at 20 min. This indicated that the p-NP appearing on the serosal side was derived not from absorption of p-NP but from hydrolysis of p-NP alpha glc through the intestinal membrane during absorption. On the other hand, after absorption of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (p-NP beta gal), which is actively absorbed by glucose transport carrier, p-NP beta gal itself appeared mostly on the serosal side. However, p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside (p-NP alpha gal) absorption, which resulted in appearance on the serosal side, was not significantly decreased in the presence of 1 mM phloridzin or in the absence of Na+, indicating that the contribution of the glucose transport carrier to p-NP alpha gal absorption was minimal. The order of the Na(+)-dependent intestinal absorption was p-NP beta glc &gt; p-NP alpha glc &gt; p-NP beta gal &gt; p-NP alpha gal.</str>

The reduced-CO complex of the soluble P-450 exhibited an absorption spectrum that is different from that of the microsomal counterpart.

      <str>Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major obstacles to successful cancer chemotherapy. Since P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the MDR-1 gene plays a key role in MDR, many P-gp-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been generated for characterization and analysis of P-gp. Among those antibodies, MRK16 has been widely used not only for elucidation of the mechanisms of P-gp-mediated MDR but also for diagnostic and therapeutic studies. Two types of magnetic cell sorting assays, termed MRK16-MACS and MRK16-MACS-FACS, have been established by us and may offer a useful tool to quantitate low levels of P-gp expression. This article describes the characteristics of the antibodies against P-gp and discuss the diagnostic implications of the antibodies.</str>

The P-glycoprotein in the placenta and mole was photolabeled with [3H]azidopine, and [3H]vincristine was transported in an ATP-dependent manner into membrane vesicles prepared from trophoblasts that expressed P-glycoprotein. These findings indicate that P-glycoprotein expressed in trophoblasts has a drug binding site(s) and the ability to transport vincristine, suggesting that P-glycoprotein in the placenta protects the fetus from xenobiotics and confers drug resistance on moles.</str>

      <str>Abstract In this study, we aimed to evaluate the mean platelet voulme (MPV) levels of trauma patients who were admitted to our emergency department. Of the total 232 trauma patients, 40 females and 192 males over the age of 18 years were included in this study. Of them, 102 patients were mild trauma [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15-13)], 40 patients were moderate (GCS 12-9) and 90 patients were severe trauma (GCS 8-3) patients. We also calculated the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) of the patients. MPV levels were evaluated with GCS and RTS values. The control group was constituted of 100 healthy adults. Mean initial MPV value of GCS 15-13 patients was 8.25 fL, 8.25 fL in GCS 12-9 patients and 8.47 fL, in GCS 8-3 patients. Trauma severity was significantly related with initial MPV (iMPV) levels (p&lt;0.05), initial Hb (iHb) levels (p&lt;0.05), initial white blood count (iWBC) (p&lt;0.05) and initial platelet (iPlt) levels (p&lt;0.05). Severity of trauma was related with control MPV (kMPV) levels (p&lt;0.05), control Hb (kHb) (p&lt;0.05), control WBC (kWBC) (p&lt;0.05), control Plt (kPlt) levels (p&lt;0.05). MPV levels (p&lt;0.05), Hb levels (p&lt;0.05), WBC levels (p&lt;0.05), Plt levels (p&lt;0.05) were significantly different between trauma group and healthy group. IMPV and control kMPV levels were not related (p=0.149). But kHb - iHb levels (p&lt;0.05), kWBC - iWBC levels (p&lt;0.05), kPlt - iPlt levels (p&lt;0.05), kGCS - iiGCS (p&lt;0.05) were related to each other. We found a correlation between iMPV and iWBC levels (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.342). Similarly, there was a correlation between severity of trauma and iMPV level (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.224). We determined a significant correlation between iMPV and iPlt levels (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.246). There was not a correlation between kMPV and kWBC (p&gt;0.05, r=0.124). kMPV and kPlt levels (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.174) were correlated. RTS was statistically related with GCS (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, RTS was related with iMPV (p&lt;0.05), iWBC(p&lt;0.05) and iPlt (p&lt;0.05) values, but there was not a relation with iHb (p&gt;0.05). We found correlations between iMPV- trauma severity (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.224), iMPV - RTS (p&lt;0.05, r=0.134), iMPV - iWBC (p&lt;0.05 r=-0.342), iMPV - iPlt (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.246). Control RTS (seventh day of hospitalization) values were not related to kMPV (p&gt;0.05), kHB (p&gt;0.05), kWBC (p&gt;0.05) and kPlt(p&gt;0.05). There was a correlation between kRTS and kMPV (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.169). Similarly, kMPV - kHb (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.141), kMPV - kPlt (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.174) were correlated. KMPV and kPlt were not correlated (p&lt;0.05, r=0.124). Initial RTS and seventh day RTS values were significantly different (p&lt;0.05). MPV may be helpful for emergency physicians for predicting the severity of trauma.</str>

We confirm numerically that the distribution n(s) of cluster size s in the critical phase obeys a power law n(s) ∝ s(-τ), where τ satisfies the scaling relation τ=1+ψ(-1). In addition the critical exponent β(p) of the order parameter varies as p, from β ≃ 0.164694 at p=0 to infinity at p=p(c)=5/32.</str>

The nature of P-P interactions is complex, and despite the large amount of research that has occurred in the field, is still poorly understood. Abnormal P-P interactions are particularly important because of their association with a variety of diseases, including cancer. This review examines P-P interactions with particular emphasis on the discovery of new anti-tumor drugs, including underlying physical forces that determine affinity and specificity and discusses classical and newer strategies used to discover inhibitors of P-P interactions, providing a number of recent cancer-related case studies and commentary.</str>

The p + p yield generally agrees with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The d + Au yield per binary collision is suppressed as eta increases, decreasing to approximately 30% of the p + p yield at eta =4.00, well below shadowing expectations. Exploratory measurements of azimuthal correlations of the forward pi0 with charged hadrons at eta approximately 0 show a recoil peak in p + p that is suppressed in d + Au at low pion energy. These observations are qualitatively consistent with a saturation picture of the low-x gluon structure of heavy nuclei.</str>

      <str>A new method for the formation of organohypophosphates containing a P-P bond under mild conditions, based on the DBU-assisted reaction of 2-alkoxy-2-thio-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholanes with O,O-dialkyl H-phosphonates or H-thiophosphonates, has been elaborated.

      <str>Regulation of the putative peptide neurotransmitter substance P was examined in the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion of the neonatal rat. Surgical decentralization (denervation) of the superior cervical ganglion increased ganglion substance P content. In cultured ganglia, the amount of substance P increased more than 50-fold after 48 hours, and this rise was dependent on protein and RNA synthesis. Veratridine prevented the increase in substance P in vitro, and tetrodotoxin blocked the veratridine effect; this suggests that sodium influx and membrane depolarization prevent substance P elevation. Immunohistochemical analysis of cultured ganglia indicated that substance P was present in the perikarya of principal sympathetic neurons and in ganglionic nerve processes. Transsynaptic impulses, through the mediation of postsynaptic sodium influx, may decrease substance P in sympathetic neurons.</str>

      <str>P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux transporter which is up-regulated at the blood-brain barrier in both morphine- and oxycodone-tolerant rats. Numerous studies have shown that many clinically employed opioid analgesics are substrates for P-gp, suggesting that up-regulation of P-gp may contribute to the development of central tolerance to opioids. The studies herein focus on the development of SAR for P-gp substrate activity in the meperidine series of compounds, and show that a meperidine analog of greater potency, N-phenylbutyl-N-normeperidine, has low activity as a P-gp substrate and has the potential to be utilized as a tool to study the contribution of P-gp to the development of central tolerance to opioids.</str>

At lower glycerol concentrations the P-450LM4 showed a tendency to aggregate. The P-450LM4 oligomers were immobilized on Ultrogel A4 under conditions allowing only one covalent link to the matrix per oligomer. In the presence of SDS, the oligomers dissociated leaving only 1/6th of the initial amount of bound protein on the matrix, suggesting that the purified P-450LM4 is a hexamer. This was confirmed by electron microscopy. The quaternary structure of the P-450LM4 was similar to that demonstrated earlier for P-450LM2.</str>

      <str>p,p'-DDT (100 to 600 mg per kilogram orally) produced spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus in mice and rats. Drugs that enhance brain serotonergic activity reduced p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus, and serotonin antagonists invariably aggravated this syndrome. p,p'-DDT-treated rats had increased concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in seven regional areas, but serotonin was increased only in the midbrain and cerebellum. We postulate that p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus may be causally related to blockage of serotonin receptors or inhibition of serotonin release into the synapse, resulting in functional deficiency of this neurotransmiter at the receptor site.</str>

The incidence of polymorphism was high (70-86%) between species, but relatively low (22-26%) between genotypes of P. vulgaris. Suitable probes were identified for the analysis of P. vulgaris and P. coccineus hybrids. The segregation pattern in F2 populations was Mendelian for two probes (LHB and VEE20) and non-Mendelian for GS-g, CHS, and CHI. Statistical analyses indicated gametic selection with preferential transmission of the P. vulgaris alleles, which may account for the selective recovery of P. vulgaris progeny types observed earlier. The available hybrids of P. vulgaris and P. coccineus and the high degree of interspecific RFLP will facilitate the construction of a linkage map for Phaseolus. </str>

The plasma substance P levels were 186+/-14 pg/ml in normal subjects and 164+/-3 pg/ml in hypertensive patients. When the sodium content of their diet was reduced to 10 mEq/day, substance P levels failed to change, but plasma renin activity and urinary kallikrein increased. An acute saline infusion also failed to alter plasma substance P levels. Assuming an upright posture increased plasma renin activity, but not substance P, in both groups of subjects.

The P-ERG varied with changing luminance, field size and defocusing parameters in the same way as P-VECP, but differed from P-VECP with changes in the check size parameter. These results suggest that the spatial tuning observed in P-VECP could not be discerned in this P-ERG study. It cannot be denied that P-ERG is distorted by P-VECP, which has a larger amplitude at about 100 ms after stimulation. In the future it will be necessary to investigate the origin of P-ERG under experimental conditions separating contrast-related response from luminance-related response.</str>

All p-alkylaminophenols quenched alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, with 7 being the most potent DPPH radical scavenger. Lipid peroxidation by rat liver microsomes was reduced by p-alkylaminophenols in dose- and aminophenol alkyl chain length-dependent fashion (3&gt;4&gt;5&gt;6), with 3 being the most potent lipid peroxidation inhibitor, at approximately 350-fold higher potency than 6.

      <str>P-450 HFLa is a form of cytochrome P-450 purified from human fetal livers. The amounts of P-450 HFLa in several fetal tissues were determined immunochemically. Detectable amounts presented in livers, kidneys, adrenals, lungs and some other tissues of human fetuses. The amounts were the highest in livers. Activities of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase in livers but not in adrenals were inhibited by the anti-P-450 HFLa antibodies, probably suggesting that distinct forms of cytochrome P-450 are responsible for the oxidations in livers and adrenals.</str>

      <str>The interference of two weak estrogens (P-1496 and P-1560) on the binding of estradiol with uterine estrogen receptors is comparatively studied. Both P-1496 and P-1560 decrease the estradiol binding capacity, but P-1560 is less effective than P-1496. Since P-1496 is a more potent estrogenic substance than P-1560, the results obtained confirm that the uterotrophic activity of estrogens is related to the binding capability to uterine estrogen receptors.</str>

      <str>Although substance P has been demonstrated in the nonhuman ovary, it has not previously been identified in normal human ovarian tissue. We examined ovarian surgical specimens from 30 women for the presence of immunoreactive substance P. With the use of a specific radioimmunoassay, immunoreactive substance P was identified in these ovarian extracts. The geometric mean of the immunoreactive substance P concentration was 0.55 pg/mg wet weight (95% confidence limits 0.04 and 6.15). Thecal and stromal concentrations of immunoreactive substance P were greater than those in the corpora lutea and tunica albuginea. Large follicles had a lower concentration of immunoreactive substance P than did small follicles. We conclude that the neuropeptide substance P is present in some normal human ovaries and may be a modulator of ovarian function.</str>

      <str>Food production in Europe is dependent on imported phosphorus (P) fertilizers, but P use is inefficient and losses to the environment high. Here, we discuss possible solutions by changes in P management. We argue that not only the use of P fertilizers and P additives in feed could be reduced by fine-tuning fertilization and feeding to actual nutrient requirements, but also P from waste has to be completely recovered and recycled in order to close the P balance of Europe regionally and become less dependent on the availability of P-rock reserves. Finally, climate-smart P management measures are needed, to reduce the expected deterioration of surface water quality resulting from climate-change-induced P loss. </str>

To understand the ecological role of these species, we tested all strains for extracellular enzyme activity; six strains representing four species showed β-glucosidase activity. Four of the identified species - P. hetheringtonii, P. paxilli, P. terrigenum, and P. westlingii - are new records for Korea.

This review aims to critically evaluate use of digoxin as a probe for P-gp-mediated clinical DDI studies, with focus on sensitivity and specificity of digoxin for P-gp.

We suggest that EF-P: (a) may play a role in translational fidelity and (b) prevents entry of fMet-tRNA into the A-site enabling it to bind to the 50S P-site.

Its measurement relies on analysis techniques which require high event multiplicity and so far can only be applied to heavy ion collisions. Here, we delineate the conditions under which elliptic flow becomes measurable in the samples of high-multiplicity (dN(ch)/dy &gt; or = 50) p-p collisions, which will soon be collected at the LHC. We observe that fluctuations in the p-p interaction region can result in a sizable spatial eccentricity even for the most central p-p collisions. Under relatively mild assumptions on the nature of such fluctuations and on the eccentricity scaling of elliptic flow, we find that the resulting elliptic flow signal in high-multiplicity p-p collisions at the LHC becomes measurable with standard techniques.</str>

      <str>The benefit of retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) with profound hypothermic circulatory arrest has been subject to much debate. We examined our experience with ascending and transverse arch repairs to determine the impact of retrograde cerebral perfusion on stroke and mortality.</str>
      <str>Between August 1991 and June 2007, we performed 1107 repairs of the ascending and transverse aortic arch. RCP was used in 82% of cases (907 of 1107). Sixty-two percent were men (682 of 1107); median age was 64 years (range, 16 to 93 years). Perioperative variables were evaluated using univariate and multivariable analysis for mortality and stroke. Thiry-day mortality was 10.4% (115 of 1107). Stroke occurred in 2.8% (31 of 1107) of patients. Univariate risk factors for mortality were increasing age (P&lt;0.0001), history of coronary artery disease (P=0.02), previous coronary artery bypass (P=0.02), emergency status (P&lt;0.0001), acute dissection (P=0.02), rupture (P=0.0001), preoperative glomerular filtration rate, bypass time (P&lt;0.0001), crossclamp time (P&lt;0.007), RCP time (P&lt;0.0001), and packed red blood cell transfusions (P=0.0001). Univariate risk factors for stroke included emergency status (P&lt;0.02), cerebrovascular disease (P&lt;0.02), and crossclamp time (P&lt;0.04). Independent risk factors for mortality were glomerular filtration rate &lt;90 mL/min (P=0.0004), emergency status (P=0.006), rupture (P=0.004), cardiopulmonary bypass time &gt;120 minutes (P&lt;0.04), and packed red blood cell transfusions (P=0.0002).

      <str>Manure additions to cropland can reduce total P losses in runoff on well-drained soils due to increased infiltration and reduced soil erosion. Surface residue management in subsequent years may influence the long-term risk of P losses as the manure-supplied organic matter decomposes. The effects of manure history and long-term (8-yr) tillage [chisel plow (CP) and no-till (NT)] on P levels in runoff in continuous corn (Zea mays L.) were investigated on well-drained silt loam soils of southern and southwestern Wisconsin. Soil P levels (0-15 cm) increased with the frequency of manure applications and P stratification was greater near the surface (0-5 cm) in NT than CP. In CP, soil test P level was linearly related to dissolved P (24-105 g ha(-1)) and bioavailable P (64-272 g ha(-1)) loads in runoff, but not total P (653-1893 g ha(-1)). In NT, P loads were reduced by an average of 57% for dissolved P, 70% for bioavailable P, and 91% for total P compared with CP. This reduction was due to lower sediment concentrations and/or lower runoff volumes in NT. There was no relationship between soil test P levels and runoff P concentrations or loads in NT. Long-term manure P applications in excess of P removal by corn in CP systems ultimately increased the potential for greater dissolved and bioavailable P losses in runoff by increasing soil P levels. Maintaining high surface residue cover such as those found in long-term NT corn production systems can mitigate this risk in addition to reducing sediment and particulate P losses.</str>

      <str>In low-income countries, the use of some organochlorine pesticides is still common in order to increase food production. Monitoring the chemical exposure is an important step in risk-reducing strategies. This is the first study to report concentrations of organochlorines in breast milk of women from Bangladesh where farming is the main income source. Organochlorines such as p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD (i.e., ∑DDT), HCB, α-, β- and γ-HCH, trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, oxy-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, mirex and polychlorinated biphenyls (CB 28, 52, 99, 101, 105, 114, 118, 123, 128, 138, 141, 149, 153, 156, 157, 163, 167, 170, 180, 183, 187, 189, 194) were analyzed in breast milk collected in 2002 from 72 first-time mothers (median age 20years) living in the rural area Matlab, Bangladesh. While the concentrations of PCBs and many of the pesticides were low, the concentrations of p,p'-DDT and its metabolite p,p'-DDE were high (median 349 and 1645ngg(-1)lipid, respectively) in comparison to other countries. The median value of ∑DDT was 2123ngg(-1)lipid. The estimated daily exposure to p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE and ∑DDTs was 10, 30 and 42μgkg(-1) body weight, respectively, in 3months old infants. The p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT ratio ranged from 1 to 23, where 58% of the mothers had a ratio below 5 indicating recent or ongoing DDT exposure. This study reports infant exposure and maternal body burden of organochlorines through breast milk. Although the findings give no reason to limit breast-feeding, it is essential to identify the main exposure sources and find means to decrease the exposure.</str>

The physical activity, physical performance (2-km walking test), cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life (EORTC-QoL-C30), co-morbidities and body-mass index (BMI) were measured after the adjuvant treatments.</str>
      <str>Overall, 191 (39%) patients were overweight (BMI=25-30) and 85 (17%) obese (BMI ≥ 30). Physical activity and performance (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001), QoL (p&lt;0.001) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol decreased (p&lt;0.001) whereas age (p=0.009), co-morbidities (p&lt;0.001), hypertension (p=0.011), metabolic syndrome (p&lt;0.001), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p=0.0043), triglycerides (p&lt;0.001), glucose (p&lt;0.001) and insulin (p&lt;0.001) increased linearly with BMI. Higher waist circumference (p=0.0011), triglyceride (p=0.020), insulin (p=0.0098), rate of metabolic syndrome (p=0.028), and lower HDL-cholesterol (p=0.012) and QoL (p&lt;0.001) were associated with low physical activity.

      <str>P-cadherin expression and the Ki-67 labelling index were analysed immunohistochemically by using tissue microarrays (TMAs). Membranous and cytoplasmic expression was scored semiquantitatively (0 to 2+).</str>
      <str>P-cadherin protein expression of any intensity (1+ to 2+) was detected in the membrane in 41.5% (132/318) and in the cytoplasm in 64.2% (204/318) of patients. In general, P-cadherin expression was significantly reduced in malignant melanomas (p&lt;0.001) and melanoma metastases (p&lt;0.001), compared with benign nevi. Additionally, loss of membranous P-cadherin was associated with Clark level (p = 0.011) and tumour thickness (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, a significantly lower P-cadherin expression was shown by dermal nevi than by compound and junctional nevi (p = 0.005; p = 0.025). In primary melanomas, a Ki-67 labelling index &lt;5% was not associated with P-cadherin protein expression, suggesting that loss of P-cadherin expression was not associated with proliferation. None of the other clinical and histological factors analysed was significantly related to P-cadherin expression. Low cytoplasmic P-cadherin expression was associated with tumour recurrence (p = 0.03) in all the patients who were analysed. After testing various multivariate Cox regression models, loss of cytoplasmic P-cadherin expression remained a highly significant adverse risk factor for tumour recurrence in patients with tumours &lt;2 mm.</str>

      <str>The P Index was proposed as a nutrient management tool in 1992 and has been implemented as such for the past decade. However, lack of water quality improvement in agricultural watersheds and discrepancies in P loss ratings between P indices have raised questions about continued use of the P Index. In response to these concerns, a symposium was held as part of the 2011 ASA, CSSA, SSSA annual meetings. This symposium produced a special collection of seven papers describing the role of P indices in P management, evaluation of P indices, new models for assessing P loss, methods to improve P indices, and changes in producer behavior resulting from P Index use. The objectives of this introductory paper are to provide background on the P Index concept, overviews of the special collection papers, and recommendations for future P Index evaluation and development research. The papers in this special collection conclude that P indices can provide accurate assessments of P loss but must be evaluated appropriately. Evaluation will require compiling large regional P loss datasets at field and small watershed scales. Simulation models may be used to generate P loss estimates; however, models must be calibrated and validated to ensure their accuracy. Further development of P indices will require coordinated regional efforts to identify common P Index frameworks and standardized interpretations. Stringent P Index evaluations will expand the utility of P indices for critical source area identification and strategic best management practice implementation by regulatory, education, and scientific communities alike.</str>

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with a radiographic method, correcting with an external reference. ER-alpha genotyping was carried out by PCR.</str>
      <str>Scores for vaginal dryness were lower for the xx (P = 0.003), and pp genotypes (P = 0.006). Hot flashes were lower for the Pp (P = 0.006) genotype.

Vaginal dryness, was associated with PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms (P = 0.037 and P = 0.039). Depression was associated with log(estrone) (P = 0.011), schooling (negatively, P = 0.012), and marginally with BMI (P = 0.066). Sleep alterations correlated with log(estrone) (P = 0.014) and marginally with years since menopause (P = 0.046).

      <str>The effects of 25 and 75 mg/kg p,p'-DDT on the CNS serotonergic system were examined in proestrous female rats. Females were treated with p,p'-DDT on the morning of proestrus and were sacrificed that evening. Levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were examined in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and preoptic areas. The binding of 3'-8-OH-DPAT [2-hydroxy-2-N, N-(di-propylamino)-tetralin], an agonist for 5-HT1A receptors, was examined in hippocampus and frontal cortex. P,p'-DDT decreased the level of 5-HT in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Elevations in 5-HIAA were present in the hypothalamus but only at the higher dose of p,p'-DDT. The dose of 25 mg/kg p,p'-DDT produced an increase in the Bmax for 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding to frontal cortical and hippocampal membranes. Membrane preparations from females given 75 mg/kg p,p'-DDT fell into two categories. Some were similar to the control but with a slightly higher Kd; others could not be analyzed by traditional linear or nonlinear regression procedures because they showed a constant proportion of bound label, independent of the concentration of 3H-ligand in the reaction. In vitro, p,p'-DDT did not compete with 3H-8-OH-DPAT for binding to cortical membranes so it is unlikely that residual pesticide in the membrane preparation accounted for the binding results. These binding results are particularly interesting because, in previous studies, the dose of 25 mg/kg p,p'-DDT was shown to be more potent than 75 mg/kg p,p'-DDT in reducing female rodent lordosis behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>In ecosystems where excretion by fish is a major flux of nutrients, the nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratio released by fish can be important in shaping patterns of algal biomass, community composition, primary production, and nutrient limitation. Demand for N and P as well as energy influences N/P excretion ratios and has broad implications in ecosystems where nutrient recycling by fishes is substantial. Bioenergetics and stoichiometric models predict that natural fish populations are generally energy-limited and therefore N/P recycling by fishes is relatively invariant. Yet, the potential for P limitation of growth has not been examined in herbivorous fishes, which are common in many aquatic habitats. We examined N/P excretion ratios and P demand in two P-rich herbivorous catfishes of the family Loricariidae, Ancistrus triradiatus (hereafter Ancistrus) and Chaetostoma milesi (hereafter Chaetostoma). Both fishes are common grazers in the Andean piedmont region of Venezuela where we conducted this study. Mass balance (MB) models indicate that these fishes have a high P demand. In fact, our Ancistrus' P MB model predicted negative P excretion rates, indicating that Ancistrus did not consume enough P to meet its P demand for growth. Direct measurement of excretion rates showed positive, but very low P excretion rates and high N/P excretion ratios for both taxa. To obtain measured P excretion rates of Ancistrus from the MB model, gross growth efficiency must be reduced by 90%. Our results suggest that growth rates of both of these herbivorous and P-rich fish are likely P-limited. If P limitation of growth is common among herbivorous fish populations, herbivorous fishes recycle likely at high N/P ratios and act to diminish the quality of their food.</str>

      <str>Coronary collaterals preserve left ventricular (LV) function during coronary occlusion by reducing myocardial ischemia and may directly influence LV compliance. We aimed to re-evaluate the relationship between coronary collaterals, measured quantitatively with a pressure wire, and simultaneously recorded LV contractility from conductance catheter data during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in humans. Twenty-five patients with normal LV function awaiting PCI were recruited. Pressure-derived collateral flow index (CFI(p)): CFI(p) = (P(w) - P(v))/(P(a) - P(v)) was calculated from pressure distal to coronary balloon occlusion (P(w)), central venous pressure (P(v)), and aortic pressure (P(a)). CFI(p) was compared with the changes in simultaneously recorded LV end-diastolic pressure (ΔLVEDP), end-diastolic volume, maximum rate of rise in pressure (ΔLVdP/dt(max); systolic function), and time constant of isovolumic relaxation (ΔLV τ; diastolic function), measured by a LV cavity conductance catheter. Measurements were recorded at baseline and following a 1-min coronary occlusion and were duplicated after a 30-min recovery period. There was significant LV diastolic dysfunction following coronary occlusion (ΔLVEDP: +24.5%, P &lt; 0.0001; and ΔLV τ: +20.0%, P &lt; 0.0001), which inversely correlated with CFI(p) (ΔLVEDP vs. CFI(p): r = -0.54, P &lt; 0.0001; ΔLV τ vs. CFI(p): r = -0.46, P = 0.0009). Subjects with fewer collaterals had lower LVEDP at baseline (r = 0.33, P = 0.02). CFI(p) was inversely related to the coronary stenosis pressure gradient at rest (r = -0.31, P = 0.03). Collaterals exert a direct hemodynamic effect on the ventricle and attenuate ischemic LV diastolic dysfunction during coronary occlusion. Vessels with lesions of greater hemodynamic significance have better collateral supply.</str>

      <str>Pollution of water resources by phosphorus (P) is a critical issue in regions with agricultural and urban development. In this study, we estimated P inputs from agricultural and urban sources in 24 catchments draining to the Central Valley in California and compared them with measured river P export to investigate hydrologic and anthropogenic factors affecting regional P retention and export. Using spatially explicit information on fertilizer use, livestock population, agricultural production, and human population, we calculated that net surface balances for anthropogenic P ranged from -12 to 648 kg P km yr in the early 2000s. Inorganic P fertilizer and manure P comprised the largest fraction of total input for all but two catchments. From 2000 to 2003, a median of 7% (range, -287 to 88%) of net annual anthropogenic P input was exported as total P (TP). Yields (kg P km yr) of dissolved inorganic P (DIP), dissolved organic P, particulate P, and TP were not significantly related to catchment-level, per area anthropogenic P input. However, there were significant relationships between mean annual P concentrations and P input from inorganic fertilizers and manure due to the concentration of agricultural land near catchment mouths and regional variation in runoff. Catchment-level P fertilizer and manure inputs explained 4 to 23% more variance in mean annual DIP and TP concentrations than percent of catchment area in agriculture. This study suggests that spatially explicit estimates of anthropogenic P input can help identify sources of multiple forms of P exported in rivers at management-relevant spatial scales.</str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular evolution of P and V protein genes of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The P gene sequences of 55 NDV isolates, representing different chronological and geographic origins, were obtained from GenBank. In this paper, the evolution of the specific regions of the NDV P gene, encoding the P and V proteins, was analyzed. The nucleotides from the shared P/V region encoded the co-amino terminus of the two proteins, while the P-V/V-P region was respectively encoded by the nucleotides within the P ORF or the V ORF in the common sequence (after the mRNA editing site). As well, the P-cut region exclusively encoded the P protein. Finally, the P-V and V-P regions were further broken down into P1 and P2 fragments with the corresponding V1 and V2 fragments. In the P gene, the P-cut portion corresponding to the C-terminal of the P protein was the most highly conserved, while the P-V region was the most variable. This was interpreted as a lower constraint for function in the common sequence than in the unique P sequence that is known to contain an important function. Interestingly, in the common P-V/V-P function, variability of V1 was compensated by a higher conservation of the corresponding P1, and conversely for the P2/V2, which suggested that the flexibility of one ORF with less function served the purpose of allowing positive selection in the other overlapping ORF that exhibited more function.</str>

Stearoyl-coA desaturase, delta-6 desaturase and delta-5 desaturase were estimated as precursor to fatty acid ratios. The results showed that stearoyl-coA desaturase was correlated with body mass index (r = 0.235, p&lt;0.05), triglyceride (r = 0.261, p&lt;0.001), and HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.226, p&lt;0.05).

In particular, meat from ostriches given citrus pulp diet exhibited higher C18:2ω6 (P&lt;0.05) and C20:4ω6 (P&lt;0.05) contents that accounted for a higher ω6/ω3 ratio (P&lt;0.05) as compared to the control group. Overall, the use of a citrus pulp-included diet in ostrich feeding did not adversely affect meat quality and, therefore, citrus pulp seems to be a possible ingredient to reduce feeding costs.</str>

      <str>Clinical data of 450 cases with sepsis in ICU from January 2004 to December 2008 were retrospectively studied. Twenty-four possible prognostic factors including clinical, chemical examinations and scores contributing to the survival of these patients were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.</str>
      <str>Univariate logistic regression analysis: eight factors were non-risk factors for sepsis, including days of hospitalization [odds ratio (OR)=0.951, P&lt;0.001], Glasgow coma score (GCS, OR=0.858 , P&lt;0.001), mean arterial pressure (OR=0.991, P=0.041), platelet count (OR=0.997, P&lt;0.001), total protein (OR=0.975,P=0.003), albumin (OR=0.955, P&lt;0.001), arterial pH (OR=0.077,P=0.001), arterial oxygen pressure (OR=0.996, P=0.014).

      <str>Two trials were conducted to evaluate a novel microbial 6-phytase expressed in Aspergillus oryzae (Ronozyme HiPhos; DSM Nutritional Products, Basel, Switzerland) in gestating and lactating sows. In the first trial, 24 sows (Duroc × Landrace; 223 kg BW) were offered, at 16 d of gestation, a low-P control diet (formulated to provide 4.0 g total P/kg; 1.5 g digestible P/kg) supplemented with 0, 500, or 1000 phytase activity (FYT)/kg of phytase. Two weeks later, fresh feces were sampled from all sows and the apparent total tract digestibility of P was measured using TiO(2) as indigestible marker. Phytase supplementation did not (P &gt; 0.10) affect the total tract digestibility of P but reduced (P &lt; 0.05) P concentration in feces (from 14.5 to 12.0 and 12.0 g/kg DM). In the second trial, 32 lactating sows (Duroc × Landrace; 282 kg BW) were used. They were offered, at 7 d of lactation, a low-P control diet (formulated to provide 6.1 g total P/kg; 3 g digestible P/kg) or the same diet supplemented with 500 FYT/kg of phytase. After 2 wk, fresh feces were sampled from all sows and the apparent total tract digestibility of P was measured using TiO(2) as indigestible marker. Phytase supplementation improved (P &lt; 0.001) the apparent total tract digestibility of P from 27.5 to 38.7% and reduced (P &lt; 0.001) P concentration in feces (from 27.5 to 21.4 g/kg DM). In conclusion, the microbial 6-phytase tested increased the apparent total tract digestibility of P in sows and reduced P excretion in feces.</str>

      <str>In the native purple bacterial reaction center (RC), light-driven charge separation utilizes only the A-side cofactors, with the symmetry related B-side inactive. The process is initiated by electron transfer from the excited primary donor (P*) to the A-side bacteriopheophytin (P* --&gt; P+ H(A)-) in approximately 3 ps. This is followed by electron transfer to the A-side quinone (P+ H(A)- --&gt; P+ Q(A)-) in approximately 200 ps, with an overall quantum yield of approximately 100%. Using nanosecond flash photolysis and RCs from the Rhodobacter capsulatus F(L181)Y/Y(M208)F/L(M212)H mutant (designated YFH), we have probed the decay pathways of the analogous B-side state P+ H(B)-. The rate of the P+ H(B)- --&gt; ground-state charge-recombination process is found to be (3.0 +/- 0.8 ns)(-1), which is much faster than the analogous (10-20 ns)(-1) rate of P+ H(A)- --&gt; ground state. The rate of P+ H(B)- --&gt; P+ Q(B)- electron transfer is determined to be (3.9 +/- 0.9 ns)(-1), which is about a factor of 20 slower than the analogous A-side process P+ H(A)- --&gt; P+ Q(A)-. The yield of P+ H(B)- --&gt; P+ Q(B)- electron-transfer calculated from these rate constants is 44%. This value, when combined with the known 30% yield of P+ H(B)- from P in YFH RCs, gives an overall yield of 13% for B-side charge separation P* --&gt; P+ H(B)- --&gt; P+ Q(B)- in this mutant. We determine essentially the same value (15%) by comparing the P-bleaching amplitude at approximately 1 ms in YFH and wild-type RCs.</str>

      <str>Slowing of inspiratory muscle relaxation has been used as an index for inspiratory muscle fatigue. However, maximum relaxation rate measured from oesophageal pressure traces after maximum sniff (P(oes) MRR) has limited clinical usefulness because it requires an oesophageal balloon catheter system.</str>
      <str>It was the aim of this study to establish whether, in neuromuscular patients, maximum relaxation rate assessed from sniff nasal pressure (P(nasal) MRR) reflects oesophageal MRR and the tension-time index of the diaphragm (TT(di)).</str>
      <str>Twenty patients with neuromuscular disease and 10 healthy subjects were studied. P(oes) and transdiaphragmatic pressure were measured while P(nasal) was recorded with a balloon advanced through the nose into the nasopharynx. Maximum P(oes), transdiaphragmatic pressure and P(nasal) were simultaneously measured while the patients performed maximal sniffs. The MRR (% pressure fall/10 ms) for each sniff, the TT(di) and the tension-time index of respiratory muscles were determined.</str>
      <str>Neuromuscular patients showed higher TT(di), lower P(oes) MRR and lower P(nasal) MRR than the control group. In patients with neuromuscular disease, the correlation coefficient of P(nasal) MRR and P(oes) MRR was 0.985 (p &lt; 0.001). Regression analysis showed that P(oes) MRR = -1.101 + 1.113.P(nasal) MRR (r(2) = 0.929, standard error of the estimate = 0.208). Indeed, P(nasal) MRR was negatively correlated with TT(di) (r = -0.914, p &lt; 0.001) and the tension-time index of respiratory muscles (r = -0.732, p &lt; 0.001). In the neuromuscular group, the mean difference between P(nasal) MRR and P(oes) MRR was 0.286 +/- 0.217%/10 ms.</str>

      <str>A field experiment with rice showed that P fertilizer application increased the concentrations of resin P in soil and total P in soil surface water, and both of them declined subsequently over time. Compared with applying mineral P fertilizer only, the integrated application of mineral-P and manure resulted in a higher resin P level within 20 days after P application. The total P concentration in soil surface water in the treatment of integrated application of mineral-P and manure was 3.4 times higher than that in the treatment of mineral-P fertilizer application only after 7 days of P application, and also, was 2.8 times higher than that in the treatment where P application rate was doubled. The potential of Ploss from surface water in the treatment of integrated application with manure was more than that in the treatment of applying-P fertilizer only. The effect of applied P sorts on P concentration in soil surface water could be ignored after 33 days of P application. Two drainages were conducted for rice growth, which caused the net P loss loading and its apparent P loss ratio in range of -0.038-0.076 kg.m-2 and 0.034-0.100%, respectively. To minimize P loss from rice production area, field drainage should be avoided in the initial week of P-fertilizer application or field harrowing.</str>

      <str>The aim of the work was to study whether or not 11-keto-β-boswellic acids prevent induction of autoimmune reactions, insulitis, and hyperglycemia in the model of multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLD-STZ) diabetes. Using male mice (n=6) diabetes was induced by daily i.p. injections of 40 mg/kg STZ for 5 days. In a second series together with STZ, daily i. p. injections of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) and O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) (7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg) were applied for 10 days. Thereafter, pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, histochemistry of pancreatic islets, and blood glucose levels were assayed. Five days after the last injection of STZ, a significant burst of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets, and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells were observed. Plasma glucose increased significantly (124.4±6.65 vs. 240.2±27.36 mg/dl, p&lt;0.05). Simultaneous treatment with KBA and AKBA significantly reduced pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.01; IL-1A p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001; IL-1B p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001; IL-2 p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001; IL-6 p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001; TNF-α p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.001; IL-4 p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001; IL-10 p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001) in the blood.

      <str>Quantitative high-pressure liquid chromatographic assays were developed that separate progesterone and 17 authentic monohydroxylated derivatives. The assays were utilized to investigate the hydroxylation of progesterone by 11 purified rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 isozymes and 8 different rat hepatic microsomal preparations. In a reconstituted system, progesterone was most efficiently metabolized by cytochrome P-450h followed by P-450g and P-450b. Seven different monohydroxylated progesterone metabolites were identified. 16 alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone, formed by 8 of the 11 isozymes, was the only detectable metabolite formed by cytochromes P-450b and P-450e. 2 alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone was formed almost exclusively by cytochrome P-450h, and 6 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and 7 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were only formed by P-450a. 6 beta-hydroxylation of progesterone was catalyzed by four isozymes with cytochrome P-450g being the most efficient, and 15 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone was formed as a minor metabolite by cytochromes P-450g, P-450h, and P-450i. None of the isozymes catalyzed 17 alpha-hydroxylation of progesterone, and only cytochrome P-450k had detectable 21-hydroxylase activity. 16 alpha-Hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P-450b was inhibited in the presence of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (1.6-80 microM), while this phospholipid either stimulated (up to 3-fold) or had no effect on the metabolism of progesterone by the other purified isozymes. Results of microsomal metabolism in conjunction with antibody inhibition experiments indicated that cytochromes P-450a and P-450h were the sole 7 alpha- and 2 alpha-hydroxylases, respectively, and that P-450k or an immunochemically related isozyme contributed greater than 80% of the 21-hydroxylase activity observed in microsomes from phenobarbital-induced rats.</str>

      <str>Rabbit antibodies against cytochrome P-450 (SCC), P-450 (11 beta), and P-450 (C-21) from bovine adrenal cortex were prepared, and it was confirmed that these three cytochrome P-450 species are immunologically distinct from one another. Cytoplasmic sites of synthesis of P-450 (SCC), P-450 (11 beta), and P-450 (C-21) in bovine adrenal cortex were determined by examining the presence of their nascent peptides on isolated free and bound ribosomes. Nascent peptides were released in vitro from ribosomes by [3H]puromycin in a high salt buffer in the presence of a detergent, and the nascent peptides of P-450 (SCC), P-450 (11 beta), and P-450 (C-21) were isolated by immunoprecipitation. The nascent peptides of these three cytochrome P-450 species were found in both free and bound ribosomal fractions, suggesting that they share common sites of synthesis in the cytoplasm. However, the nascent peptides of mitochondrial P-450 (SCC) and P-450 (11 beta) were more concentrated in the free ribosomal fraction, whereas those of microsomal P-450 (C-21) were more abundant in the bound ribosomal fraction. The nascent peptides of the three cytochrome P-450 species were released from the membrane-bound ribosomes of rough microsomes into the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles by puromycin treatment.</str>

      <str>Fertilisation of agricultural land causes an accumulation of nutrients in the top soil layer, among which phosphorus (P) is particularly persistent. Changing land use from farmland to forest affects soil properties, but changes in P pools have rarely been studied despite their importance to forest ecosystem development. Here, we describe the redistributions of the P pools in a four-decadal chronosequence of post-agricultural common oak (Quercus robur L.) forests in Belgium and Denmark. The aim was to assess whether forest age causes a repartitioning of P throughout the various soil P pools (labile P, slowly cycling P and occluded P); in particular, we addressed the time-related alterations in the inorganic versus organic P fractions. In less than 40 years of oak forest development, significant redistributions have occurred between different P fractions. While both the labile and the slowly cycling inorganic P fractions significantly decreased with forest age, the organic fractions significantly increased. The labile P pool (inorganic + organic), which is considered to be the pool of P most likely to contribute to plant-available P, significantly decreased with forest age (from &gt;20 to &lt;10% of total P), except in the 0-5 cm of topsoil, where labile P remained persistently high. The shift from inorganic to organic P and the shifts between the different inorganic P fractions are driven by biological processes and also by physicochemical changes related to forest development. It is concluded that the organic labile P fraction, which is readily mineralisable, should be taken into account when studying the bioavailable P pool in forest ecosystems.</str>

      <str>p,p'-DDE, the main metabolite of DDT, is still detected in aquatic environments throughout the world. Here, the effects and mechanisms by which p,p'-DDE exposure might affect the immune system of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was studied. Isolated salmon splenic and pronephric leukocytes were incubated with different concentrations of p,p'-DDE, and cell viability, induction of apoptosis, and mitogenic responses were measured by flow cytometry and Alamar Blue assay. p,p'-DDE significantly reduced cell viability and proliferation and increased apoptosis. The effect of p,p'-DDE on pronephric leukocytes was more severe than on splenic leukocytes, likely because pronephric leukocytes had a higher proportion of granulocytes, cells that appear more sensitive to p,p'-DDE. The effect of p,p'-DDE on leukocytes appeared to vary between developmental stages or seasonal differences. The mitogenic response of leukocytes of chinook salmon exposed to p,p'-DDE in vivo exhibited a biphasic dose-response relationship. Only leukocytes isolated from salmon treated with 59 ppm p,p'-DDE had a significantly lower percentage of Ig+ blasting cells than controls, although the response was biphasic. These results support the theory that exposure to chemical contaminants could lead to an increase in disease susceptibility and mortality of fish due to immune suppression.</str>

Unfortunately, sagittal projections of all nasolabial structures, Cph (P &lt; 0.001), Sa' (P &lt; 0.001), Nt (P &lt; 0.001), Cph' (P &lt; 0.001), Sa' (P &lt; 0.05), and Nt' (P &lt; 0.001), decreased significantly and were insufficient after operation.</str>
      <str>In vertical dimension, nasolabial displacements were corrected partially by primary surgery, and catching-up growth happened since then. Insufficient sagittal projections of the lip and nose were corrected successfully by lip repair, but lip repair itself had adverse effects on nasolabial sagittal growth.</str>

      <str>Over a 5-year period (1982-1986) 176 cases of infective endocarditis on prosthesis (IEP) were recorded in 40 cardiology departments. 65 p. 100 of the patients were male, and the mean age of the population was 51 years. Mechanical prostheses were involved in 57 p. 100 of the cases and bioprosthesis in 43 p. 100. There was a high proportion of initial indications for bacterial endocarditis (18 p. 100) and for reoperation on prosthesis (10 p. 100). IEP developed early in 40 cases and late in 139 cases; 19 (48 p. 100) of the early IEPs were staphylococcal, while 31 p. 100 of late IEPs were streptococcal (p less than 0.01). 143 patients were reoperated upon within less than 1 month in 41 p. 100 of the cases, with a pre-operative antibiotic therapy of less than 10 days in 39 p. 100. Reoperation was performed in stage IV or as an emergency in 45 p. 100 of the cases. Abscesses were three times more frequent with aortic prostheses than with mitral prostheses (58 p. 100 vs 20 p. 100, p less than 0.001). Vegetations were more frequent on mechanical prostheses than on bioprostheses (43 p. 100 vs 31 p. 100, NS). The operative mortality rate was 25 p. 100; the mortality rate of unoperated patients was even higher (31 p. 100). The survival rate in operated IEP was 51 p. 100 at 30 months, as against 46 p. 100 at 12 months in unoperated IEP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>To determine the influence of body weight and prostate volume on surgical outcomes after radical retropubic prostatectomy.</str>
      <str>Between January 1994 and July 2000, 1024 men underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy by a single surgeon. Information was collected on body weight, prostate volume, operative time, estimated blood loss, allogenic transfusion rate, intraoperative complications, perioperative complications, postoperative complications, surgical margin status, and length of hospital stay. Postoperative continence and erectile function were assessed from self-administered questionnaires.</str>
      <str>Body weight was not significantly related to operative time (P = 0.09), estimated blood loss (P = 0.12), allogenic transfusion rate (P = 0.49), intraoperative complications (P = 0.37), perioperative complications (P = 0.84), postoperative complications (P = 0.44), positive margin rate (P = 0.07), length of hospital stay (P = 0.27), postoperative continence (P = 0.72), or postoperative erectile function (P = 0.92). The prostate volume was significantly and directly related to the estimated blood loss (P = 0.02), allogenic transfusion rate (P = 0.01), and length of hospital stay (P = 0.01). The prostate volume was significantly and inversely related to the positive surgical margin rate (P = 0.03). The prostate volume was not significantly related to the operative time (P = 0.12), intraoperative complications (P = 0.68), perioperative complications (P = 0.73), postoperative complications (P = 0.14), postoperative continence (P = 0.23), or postoperative erectile function (P = 0.90).</str>
      <str>No clinically relevant risks were associated with increasing body weight. Intraoperative bleeding resulting in higher transfusion rates represented the only clinically significant outcome that was adversely impacted by prostate volume. In the hands of experienced surgeons, radical retropubic prostatectomy can be performed in heavy men and in men with large prostates with excellent outcomes.</str>

      <str>Two P elements, inserted at the cytological site 1A on an X chromosome from an Drosophila melanogaster natural population (Lerik, USSR), were isolated by genetic methods to determine if they are sufficient to cause the P cytotype, the cellular condition that regulates the P family of transposable element. The resulting "Lerik P(1A)" line (abbreviated "Lk-P(1A)") carries only one P element in situ hybridization site but genomic Southern analysis indicates that this site contains two, probably full length, P copies separated by at least one EcoRI cleavage site. Because the Lk-P(1A) line shows some transposase activity, at least one of these two P elements is autonomous. The Lk-P(1A) line fully represses germline P element activity as judged by the GD sterility and snw hypermutability assays; this result shows that the P cytotype can be elicited by only two P element copies. However, the Lk-P(1A) line does not fully repress delta 2-3(99B) transposase activity in the soma, although it fully represses delta 2-3(99B) transposase activity in the germline (delta 2-3(99B) is an in vitro modified P element that produces a high level of transposase activity in both the germline and the soma). The germline regulatory properties of the Lk-P(1A) line are maternally transmitted, even when the delta 2-3(99B) element is used as the source of transposase. By contrast, the partial regulation of delta 2-3(99B) somatic activity is chromosomally inherited. These results suggest that the regulatory P elements of the Lk-P(1A) line are inserted near a germline-specific enhancer.</str>

      <str>An ab initio study has been carried out to determine the structures, relative stabilities, and spin-spin coupling constants of a set of 15 fluoro-substituted 1,3-diborata-2,4-diphosphoniocyclobutanes B(2)P(2)F(n)H(8-n), for n = 0, 1, 2, 4, with four-member B-P-B-P rings. Except for B(2)P(2)F(4)H(4) with four fluorines bonded to two borons, these rings are puckered in a butterfly conformation. For a fixed number of fluorines, the isomers with B-F bonds are significantly more stable than those with P-F bonds. As the number of fluorines increases, the energy difference between the most stable isomer and the other isomers increases. Transition structures which interconvert axial and equatorial positions present relatively small inversion barriers. Coupling constants involving (31)P, namely, (1)J(B-P), (1)J(P-F), (2)J(P-P), (2)J(P-F), and (3)J(P-F) are large and are capable of providing structural information. They are sensitive to the number of fluorines present and can discriminate between axial, equatorial, and geminal B-F and P-F bonds, although not all do this to the same extent. (1)J(B-P) and (2)J(P-P) are similar in equilibrium and transition structures. Although transition structures no longer discriminate between axial and equatorial bonds, (1)J(P-F) and (3)J(P-F) remain sensitive to the number of fluorine atoms present.</str>

      <str>Background and rationale for the study. The aim of the study was to determine the prognostic value of histopathological findings with special care to the severity of liver fibrosis at the moment of hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) in children with biliary atresia (BA). We performed analysis of 142 wedge liver biopsies taken at the time of HPE. All patients were operated by the same surgical team between 1995 and 2007. According to the outcome 6 months after HPE patients were divided into prognostic groups: group 1-bilirubin level &lt; 2 mg% (n = 65), group 2-bilirubin level &gt; 2 mg% (n = 77). Liver biopsies were re-evaluated according to the extended histopathological protocol and then were compared between the prognostic groups. Survival with native liver (SNL) estimates were performed in regard to severity of liver fibrosis.</str>
      <str>Survival with native liver estimates after 2, 5 and 10 years in patients after successful operation were 96%, 91%, 75% vs. 30%, 11%, and 5% if operation failed (p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference between groups in the following variables: fibrosis (p = 0.69), portal inflammation (p = 0.99), lobular inflammation (p = 0.95), cholangiolitis (p = 0.23), accumulation of bile pigments (zone 1:p = 0.49; zone 2:p = 0.51; zone 3:p = 0.48), bile plugs in canaliculi (p = 0.12), bile plugs in ducts (p = 0.32), bilirubinostasis in hepatocytes (p = 0.45), bile ductular proliferation (p = 0.59), ductal plate malformation (p = 0.12), focal necrosis (p = 0.44), giant cell transformation (p = 0.45), haematopoesis (p = 0.52), ductopenia (p = 0.46), microabscesses (p = 0.49), ballooning of hepatocytes (p = 0.08). The actuarial 5/10-year SNL was not dependent on severity of liver fibrosis (log-rank test p = 0.84). The severity of fibrosis corresponded neither with the age at HPE nor with the laboratory findings before operation but increased the risk of portal hypertension.</str>

      <str>Different livestock feeds manipulations have been reported to reduce the total P concentration in manure. Information on the influence of these dietary manipulation strategies on the forms of P in manure is, however, limited. This study was, therefore, conducted to investigate the effect of diet manipulation through feed micronization and enzyme supplementation on the forms of P in swine manure. Eight growing pigs were fed four diets: barley-raw pea (BRP), barley-micronized pea (BMP), barley-raw pea with enzyme (BRPE), and barley-micronized pea with enzyme (BMPE) in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Because we are interested in the effect of enzyme cocktail and pea micronization on manure P, we did not reduce the non-phytate P with enzyme addition in this study. The fecal material and urine were collected and analyzed for total P. Fecal material was fractionated to determine the total P in H2O-, NaHCO3-, NaOH-, and HCl-extractable fractions. The total P in the residual fractions was also determined. About 98% of the total P excreted by the pigs was found in the fecal material. Inclusion of micronized pea in pig diet did not have any significant effect (p &gt; 0.1) on either the total P or the different P fractions in the manure. The labile P (the sum of H2O-P and NaHCO3-P) was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) by the addition of enzyme to swine diets. Pigs fed the BRPE and BMPE had 14 and 18% lower labile P, respectively, compared with pigs fed the BRP. Enzyme addition to pig diets reduced not only the total P in manure, but also the labile P fraction, which is of great environmental concern. Thus, the potential of P loss to runoff and the subsequent eutrophication can be reduced by enzyme addition to pig diets.</str>

      <str>Goat antibody IgG produced against bovine corpus luteum mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc) associated with cholesterol side chain cleavage (CSCC) was used to compare immunological characteristics of mitochondrial cytochrome P-450s from the bovine adrenal cortex (BAM), bovine corpus luteum (BCLM), and human placenta (HPM). In Ouchterlony double diffusion, anti-P450scc produced a single band with BAM and BCLM P-450scc, but not with HPM P-450scc or BAM P-450 11 beta. Appropriate concentrations of this anti-P-450scc IgG inhibited the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in BCLM and BAM preparations equivalently, but inhibition of placental P-450scc was considerably less. The addition of BCLM iron sulfur protein and iron sulfur protein reductase to HPM P-450scc increased CSCC approximately 5-fold. Under these conditions, anti-P-450scc inhibited CSCC in HPM. Solubilized and sonicated BCLM preparations were inhibited equivalently but more than whole mitochondria. Addition of anti-P-450scc IgG to BAM increased 11 beta-hydroxylation activity in concentration-dependent fashion. It appears that the cytochrome P-450sccs from BAM and BCLM are very similar if not identical, but immunologically different from HPM P-450scc. The BAM P-450 11 beta is immunochemically distinct from BCLM P-450scc. The CSCC and 11 beta-hydroxylation systems of the adrenal are intimately linked because inhibition of P-450scc markedly stimulated 11 beta-hydroxylation. Finally, the inhibition of CSCC activity of BAM, BCLM, and HPM P-450 indicates that the antigenic effect is directed toward the active site.</str>

      <str>Acute cannabidiol treatment of mice inactivated hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450IIIA (P-450IIIA) and markedly inhibited in vitro cannabinoid metabolism. Antibodies raised against purified P-450IIIA inhibited the microsomal formation of quantitatively minor cannabinoid metabolites but had no effect on the major metabolites. Cannabinoid hydroxylation to the major metabolites was used as a functional probe to isolate and purify a P-450 (termed P-450THC) from hepatic microsomes of untreated mice. The purified protein had an apparent molecular weight of 47,000 and a specific content of 15.4 nmol/mg and exhibited an absorbance maximum at 452 nm for the reduced carbon monoxide complex. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the first 16 residues of P-450THC suggests that it is a member of the P-450IIC subfamily, because its sequence is 85 and 69% identical to published sequences of rat hepatic P-450IIC7 and P-450IIC6, respectively. P-450THC exhibited high activity for cannabinoid hydroxylation and specifically produced 6 alpha- and 7-hydroxy-delta 1-tetrahydrocannabinol, as well as 6 alpha-, 7-, and 4"-hydroxycannabidiol. Unlike anti-P-450IIIA antibody, antibody raised against purified P-450THC markedly inhibited the microsomal formation of all major cannabinoid metabolites. Similar immunoinhibition studies also revealed the existence of orthologs of mouse P-450THC and P-450IIIA in human liver microsomes. Thus, cannabidiol treatment of mice resulted in the inactivation of at least two constitutive P-450 isozymes, which together account for the majority of the detected cannabinoid metabolites.</str>

      <str>Since pesticides have been shown to interact with P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the purpose of this study was to examine the possible role of P-gp in pesticide resistance in the tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens). Using three P-gp antibodies, P-gp expression in various resistant populations of tobacco budworms was found to be 2-6-times that of the susceptible larvae. Tobacco budworm P-gp was glycosylated and localized primarily in the cuticle and fat body with little expression in the mid gut. To determine the role of P-gp in pesticide resistance, resistant tobacco budworm larvae were treated with a P-gp inhibitor, quinidine, and challenged with various doses of thiodicarb. Inhibition of P-gp decreased the LD50 for thiodicarb by a factor of 12.5. Quinidine treatment did not result in a significant inhibition of the P-450 system nor did it alter the feeding of the larvae, suggesting the potential involvement of P-gp in pesticide resistance. An age-dependent increase in P-gp expression was detected in resistant larvae as compared to control, susceptible larvae. This correlates with the reported age-dependent increase in resistance and is further evidence supporting the role of P-gp in the development of pesticide resistance.</str>

To monitor its estrous cyclicity, we earlier used an indirect ELISA to show that levels of fecal progesterone (P(4))-metabolite (allopregnanolone: 5α-P-3OH) in semi-captive females sampled randomly positively correlated with serum P(4) levels [12]. In this longitudinal study (51 weeks), we measured levels of fecal 5α-P-3OH and serum P(4) in seven semi-captive female elephants. Females exhibited three types of hormonal profiles. Four females showed cyclical patterns of fecal 5α-P-3OH and serum P(4) typical of normal estrous cycles, two showed acyclic pattern while one showed high values indicative of a pregnant animal. Values for anestrous or follicular phases were ≤ 0.3 μg g(-1) (5α-P-3OH) and ≤ 0.3 ng mL(-1) (P(4)); for luteal phase 0.32-11.09 μg g(-1) (5α-P-3OH) and 0.32-1.48 ng mL(-1) (P(4)); for pregnancy 1.41-7.38 μg g(-1) (5α-P-3OH) and 0.39-1.6 ng mL(-1) (P(4)). A positive correlation (t = 8.8, p &lt; 0.01, n = 321) between levels of fecal 5α-P-3OH and serum P(4) was observed. A random sample of 30 free-ranging female elephants showed fecal 5α-P-3OH values of 0.06-23.4 μg g(-1), indicating them to be in different stages of estrous cyclicity. This study is the first to assess the reproductive phases of female Asian elephants based on the correlative-patterns of both the fecal 5α-P-3OH and serum P(4) values over multiple estrous cycles. This has a potential application in the reproductive management and conservation of Asian elephants.</str>

      <str>Anogenital distance (AGD) at birth is regarded as a useful measurement that reflects the prenatal androgenic status in rodents. However, the impact of xenoantiandrogens on human development is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential antiandrogenic impact of prenatal DDT metabolites (p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT) exposure on infant AGD, using a non-age-dependent anal position index (API). As part of an ongoing perinatal cohort study on the effects of organochlorine pesticides in children's neurodevelopment, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 71 infants (37 males and 34 females). Maternal serum levels of DDT metabolites (p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT) before and during each trimester of pregnancy were determined by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography. During postnatal home visits at 3, 6, and 12 or 18 months of age, the children's weight and API were evaluated. Multiple lineal regression models were used to estimate the potential endocrine disruptor activity of prenatal p,p'-DDE exposure. Boys had significantly higher API values than girls (0.6 versus 0.5; P &lt; 0.001). Only among boys, a doubling increase of maternal p,p'-DDE serum levels during the first trimester of pregnancy, were associated with a significant reduction of API (beta=-0.02; P= 0.02). No effect of p,p'-DDT on AGD was observed. Evidence of the effect of prenatal p,p'-DDE on external genital differentiation is scarce and not consistent in the literature. Further studies are needed to confirm a hormonal disruptive effect on the development of external genitalia, due not only to p,p'-DDE but also due to other antiandrogenic persistent compounds.</str>

      <str>Agricultural P transport in runoff is an environmental concern. An important source of P runoff is surface-applied, unincorporated manures, but computer models used to assess P transport do not adequately simulate P release and transport from surface manures. We developed a model to address this limitation. The model operates on a daily basis and simulates manure application to the soil surface, letting 60% of manure P infiltrate into soil if manure slurry with less than 15% solids is applied. The model divides manure P into four pools, water-extractable inorganic and organic P, and stable inorganic and organic P. The model simulates manure dry matter decomposition, and manure stable P transformation to water-extractable P. Manure dry matter and P are assimilated into soil to simulate bioturbation. Water-extractable P is leached from manure when it rains, and a portion of leached P can be transferred to surface runoff. Eighty percent of manure P leached into soil by rain remains in the top 2 cm, while 20% leaches deeper. This 2-cm soil layer contributes P to runoff via desorption. We used data from field studies in Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arkansas to build and validate the model. Validation results show the model accurately predicted cumulative P loads in runoff, reflecting successful simulation of the dynamics of manure dry matter, manure and soil P pools, and storm-event runoff P concentrations. Predicted runoff P concentrations were significantly related to (r2=0.57) but slightly less than measured concentrations. Our model thus represents an important modification for field or watershed scale models that assess P loss from manured soils.</str>

      <str>We investigated whether vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, alters plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and arginine.</str>
      <str>ADMA, SDMA, and arginine were measured (0-540min) in 12 patients with pulmonary hypertension after a single oral dose of vardenafil. Invasive hemodynamic data were collected at baseline and after 60min.</str>
      <str>A reduction in ADMA was observed at 30 and 45min with a median change of -11.1% (P=0.021) and -12.5% (P=0.002). SDMA decreased with a median -5.3% change (P=0.032) at 45min. An increase in arginine, median 40.3% (P=0.002), 45.0% (P=0.010), and 77.1% (P=0.008) was observed at 120, 300, and 540min respectively. An increase in the arginine/ADMA ratio, median 11.7% (P=0.012), 32.5% (P=0.003), 26.5% (P=0.021), 33% (P=0.007), 48.5% (P=0.007), and 63.1% (P=0.008) was observed at 15, 45, 60, 120, 300, and 540min respectively. There was a positive correlation between vardenafil exposure and the percent change in the arginine/ADMA ratio from baseline to 540min (r=0.80; P=0.01). A correlation between baseline mean right atrial pressure (mRAP) and baseline ADMA (r=0.65; P=0.023), and baseline SDMA (r=0.61; P=0.035) was observed. A correlation between the baseline arginine/ADMA ratio and baseline cardiac output (CO) (r=0.59; P=0.045) and baseline cardiac index (CI) (r=0.61; P=0.036) was observed.

      <str>Nonanesthesiologist-administered propofol (NAAP) is controversial due to deep sedation concerns.</str>
      <str>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of moderate sedation with two different NAAP regimens for colonoscopy.</str>
      <str>This was a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial allocating 135 consecutive outpatients to placebo (group P) or midazolam 2 mg (group M+P) before NAAP targeted to moderate sedation. Depth of sedation every 2 min throughout the procedure, propofol doses, recovery times, complications and patient and endoscopist satisfaction were measured.</str>
      <str>A total of 84 % of assessments of the depth of sedation were moderate. Mean induction (76 [40-150] vs. 53 [30-90]) and total propofol doses (mg) (136 [60-270] vs. 104 [50-190]) were significantly higher for group P (p &lt; 0.001). However, deep sedation was significantly more prevalent in group M+P in minutes 4 (16 vs. 1 %, p = 0.05), 6 (20 vs. 3.5 %, p = 0.046) and 8 (17 vs. 1.8 %, p = 0.06) of the procedure, coinciding with midazolam peak action. From minute 8 on, moderate sedation was significantly deeper for M+P (p = 0.002). Early recovery time (6.8 min vs. 5.2, p = 0.007), but not discharge time (10.4 min vs. 9.8, p = 0.5), was longer for M+P. Pain perception (P 1.03 vs. M+P 0.3, p = 0.009) and patient satisfaction scores (P 9.4 vs. M+P 9.8, p = 0.047) were better for M+P. No major complications occurred.</str>
      <str>Moderate sedation was feasible with both NAAP regimens. Drug synergy in the midazolam plus propofol sedation regimen promotes a deeper and longer moderate sedation, improving patient satisfaction rates but prolonging early recovery time (Clinical Trials gov NCT01428882).</str>

      <str>Even though platelet volume has been supposed to be indicator of platelet activation, contrasting results have been reported on its relationship with the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD). No data have been so far reported on Platelet-Large Cell Ratio (P-LCR). Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether P-LCR is associated with CAD. We measured P-LCR in 1882 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography. Significant CAD was defined as stenosis &gt;50% in at least 1 coronary vessel. We additionally measured Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) in 359 patients. The relationship between P-LCR and platelet aggregation was evaluated by PFA-100 and Multiplate. Patients with higher P-LCR were older (P = 0.038), with larger prevalence of diabetes (P &lt; 0.0001), dilated cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease (P = 0.004) and less often family history of CAD (P = 0.045), more often on statins (P = 0.002), and diuretics (P = 0.016). P-LCR was significantly associated with baseline glycaemia (P = 0.001) and RBC count (P &lt; 0.001), but inversely related to platelet count (P &lt; 0.0001). P-LCR was not associated with the prevalence of CAD (adjusted P = 0.3) or its severity. In addition, P-LCR was not related to Carotid IMT or platelet aggregation in patients with or without aspirin therapy. This study showed that P-LCR is not related to platelet aggregation, aspirin resistance, the extent of CAD and carotid IMT. Thus, P-LCR can not be considered as a marker of platelet reactivity or a risk factor for CAD.</str>

      <str>The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling axis controls cell proliferation and survival and has achieved major importance as a target for cancer therapy. This investigation evaluated the expression of the major components P-AKT, P-mTOR, PI3K and P-S6rp in salivary gland cancer.</str>
      <str>Immunohistochemical expression of P-AKT, P-mTOR, PI3K and P-S6rp was evaluated and correlated to clinicopathological parameters and survival of 272 patients with salivary gland carcinomas.</str>
      <str>Analysis of all tumours together revealed an increased expression of all components of the pathway in comparison to normal salivary gland control tissue. Nuclear expression of P-AKT was associated with young age, localised tumour stage, absence of lymph node metastases and favourable prognosis. On the contrary, cytoplasmic P-AKT displayed unfavourable tumour characteristics like high-grade malignancy, and worse overall survival. In comparison to cytoplasmic/membrane mTOR expression, nuclear P-mTOR was associated with absence of lymph node metastases and higher survival rates. PI3K and P-S6rp were exclusively found in the cytoplasm. Expression of P-S6rp was correlated to increased age, advanced tumour size and lymph node metastases. In all tumours together, nuclear P-AKT positively correlated with nuclear P-mTOR, whereas P-S6rp was associated with expression of PI3K and cytoplasmic P-AKT. In acinic cell carcinoma, cytoplasmic expression of P-AKT, P-mTOR, PI3K and P-S6rp was positively associated with each other. In conclusion, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling is active in salivary gland cancer and might function as a target for personalised therapy. P-AKT and P-mTOR possess distinct molecular functions with impact on prognosis depending on their cellular localisation.</str>

      <str>By the method of P fractionation, we examined sedimentary P fractions in Lake Dianchi before and during cyanobacterial blooms, namely in April 2004 and August 2004, respectively. In this study, the whole lake is divided into four areas to discuss P fractions in sediment and the relationship between them and water quality or the nutrient status. The results show that where the water body was much more eutrophic (higher levels of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll and trophic status index) in Lake Dianchi, there can be more potentially available phosphorus (BD-P and NaOH-P) and less no available phosphorus (HCl-P and residual P) in the corresponding sediments. Statistical analysis and statistical plots are used to compare the distribution of every P fraction during cyanobacterial blooms with that before cyanobacterial blooms, and the results indicate that the different P fractions had the different mobility. HCl-P and residual P were relatively stable, while NaOH-P, BD-P and NH4Cl-P were more mobile. BD-P can intensively be released from sediment to water and consequently promote cyanobacterial blooms, and at the same time the NaOH-P concentration increased in sediment, which can result from that BD-P released can be partly immobilized to NaOH-P. During cyanobacterial blooms BD-P can be as a source, but NaOH-P as a sink. Besides, total phosphorus in sediment had no significant differences between two samplings.</str>

      <str>Three cytochrome P-450 preparations, designated as cytochrome P-450ca, cytochrome P-450cb, and cytochrome P-448c fraction, were separated and purified about 23-, 50-, and 29-fold, respectively, from the cholate extracts of rabbit colon mucosa microsomes. Their specific contents were 1.2, 2.6, and 1.5 nmol of cytochrome P-450 per mg of protein, respectively. Cytochrome P-450ca and cytochrome P-450cb migrated as heme-containing polypeptide bands with molecular weights of about 53,000 and 57,000, respectively, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The CO-reduced difference spectra of cytochrome P-450ca, cytochrome P-450cb, and cytochrome P-448c fraction showed maxima at 451, 450, and 449 nm, respectively. Cytochrome P-450ca efficiently catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) and the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of caprate, laurate, and myristate in the reconstituted system containing cytochrome P-450ca, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, cytochrome b5, and phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, cytochrome P-450cb and cytochrome P-448c fraction had no detectable activity toward PGA1 and fatty acids. Both catalyzed aminopyrine and benzphetamine N-demethylation. Cytochrome P-448c fraction also hydroxylated benzo(a)pyrene, and phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylserine exhibited a stimulatory effect on this activity. The results show that rabbit colon microsomes contain catalytically different cytochrome P-450, one of which is specialized for the omega-oxidation prostaglandins, the others being involved in the metabolism of exogenous compounds such as drugs and polycyclic hydrocarbons.</str>

      <str>A P index was developed as a tool to rank agricultural fields on the basis of P loss vulnerability, helping to target remedial P management options within watersheds. We evaluated two approaches, a soil P threshold and components of a P index, by comparing site vulnerability estimates derived from these two approaches with measured runoff P losses in an agricultural watershed in Pennsylvania. Rainfall-surface runoff simulations (70 mm h(-1) for 30 min) were conducted on 57 sites representing the full range of soil P concentrations and management conditions found in the watershed. Each site was comprised of two, abutting 2-m2 runoff plots, serving as duplicate observations. For sites that had not received P additions for at least six months prior to the study, Mehlich-3 P concentration was strongly associated with dissolved P concentrations (r2 = 0.86) and losses (r2 = 0.83) in surface runoff, as well as with total P concentration (r2 = 0.80) and loss (r2 = 0.74). However, Mehlich-3 P alone was poorly correlated with runoff P from sites receiving manure within three weeks prior to rainfall. The P index effectively described 88 and 83% of the variability in dissolved P concentrations and losses from all sites in the watershed, and P index ratings exhibited strong associations with total P concentrations (r2 = 0.81) and losses (r2 = 0.79). When site-specific observations were extrapolated to all fields in the watershed, management recommendations derived from a P index approach were less restrictive than those derived from the soil P threshold approach, better reflecting the low P loads exported from the watershed.</str>

      <str>Substance P at micromolar concentrations enhances the uptake of [14C]guanidinium in neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cells, an effect which most likely indicates activation of Na+ permeability. The substance P receptor was characterized pharmacologically. Analogues of substance P with D-amino acids e.g. spantide, and substance P-methyl ester were similarly active. Substance P (free acid), fragments of the substance P precursor, and substance P-(1-9) displayed no activity. This indicates the importance of the hydrophobic C-terminal for stimulation of the hybrid cells. The potency was reduced with decreasing length the of C-terminal fragments. However, the substance P antagonists [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,Nle11]substance P-(4-11) and [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,10]substance P-(4-11) showed substantially greater activity than substance P-(4-11). Substance P-(6-11) (i.e. H-Arg-DTrp-MePhe-DTrp-Leu-Met-NH2) behaved as a mixed agonist-antagonist. At concentrations higher than 10 microM, it inhibited the stimulation exerted by substance P. No other peptides of the tachykinin family (neurokinins A and B, physalaemin, eledoisin, kassinin) nor the synthetic analogues with specificity for certain receptor subtypes ([pGlu6,Pro9]substance P-(6-11), DiMe-C7, i.e. [pGlu5,MePhe8,Sar9]substance P-(5-11) and senktide, i.e. N-succinyl-[Asp6,MePhe8]substance P-(6-11) had any effect on guanidinium uptake in the hybrid cells. Hence, the substance P site with low affinity on the hybrid cells does not fit into the usual classification of tachykinin receptors but resembles the site that modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on chromaffin cells.</str>

      <str>Little is known about P species in agro-industrial byproducts from developing countries, which may be either pollutants or valuable soil amendments. The present study speciated P in dry (COD) and wet (COW) coffee, sisal (SIS), barley malt (BEB) and sugar cane processing (FIC) byproducts, and filter cakes of linseed (LIC) and niger seed (NIC)with sequential fractionation, solution (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and P K- and L(2,3)-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The sequential P fractionation recovered 59% to almost 100% of total P (P(t)), and more than 50% of P(t) was extracted by H(2)O and NaHCO(3) in five out of seven samples. Similarly, the NaOH + EDTA extraction for solution (31)P NMR recovered 48-94% of P(t). The (31)P NMR spectra revealed orthophosphate (6-81%), pyrophosphate (0-10%), and orthophosphate monoesters (6-94%). Orthophosphate predominated in COD, COW, SIS, and FIC, whereas BEB, UC, and NIC were rich in orthophosphate monoesters. The concentrations of P(i), and P(o) determined in the sequential and NaOH + EDTA extractions and (31)P NMR spectra were strongly and positively correlated (r = 0.88-1.00). Furthermore, the P K- and L(2,3)-edge XANES confirmed the H(2)SO(4)--P(i) detected in the sequential fractionation by unequivocal identification of Ca--P phases in a few samples. The results indicate that the combined use of all four analytical methods is crucial for comprehensive P speciation in environmental samples and the application of these byproducts to soil.</str>

      <str>The average age of all women was 34.8 years (standard deviation (SD) ± 5.7 years), and time since PM diagnosis was 3.8 years (SD ± 4.4 years, p = 0.19). The gynecologist (69%) and internet (67%) were the best expected sources of information. Women with PM feared osteoporosis more than controls (p &lt; 0.0001). Women with SIPM (p = 0.006) and POF (p = 0.01) had higher rates of depression compared to controls. SIPM women were more anxious than women with POF (p = 0.04) and both SIPM (p = 0.002) and CIPM (p = 0.02) women were more anxious than controls. Women with POF had higher health evaluation (p = 0.03), fitness evaluation (p = 0.01) and fitness orientation (p = 0.01) than women with SIPM. Controls had higher health evaluation than women with SIPM (p = 0.001) and CIPM (p = 0.04), higher fitness evaluation than women with SIPM (p = 0.02) and CIPM (p = 0.04), and higher fitness orientation than SIPM women (p &lt; 0.0001). Sexual dysfunction (p &lt; 0.0001) and dyspareunia (p = 0.001) were higher in CIPM women than controls. Controls were more sexually responsive than POF women (p = 0.008). SIPM (p = 0.008) and POF (p = 0.04) women reported decreased confidence to manage disease.</str>

      <str>The pantropical fern genus Pteris L. has about 250 species of which 60 occur in the American continent. We studied the morphogenesis of the gametophyte, and the morphology of the young sporophytes of four species: P. cretica, P. ensiformis, P. multifida and P. vittata, together with a palynological analysis that includes the ability of spores to germinate. Gametophytes were obtained trough in vitro culture techniques with agar-gellified Knudson medium. Young sporophytes were placed in earth-sand (3:1) sterile substrate. We used light and SEM microscopy. Triletes spores predominate, but monolete, tetralete, and other types of apertura are often found. The viability of spores is not affected by the variation, so the term spore polymorphism is applied to the condition occurring among these species. Spore polymorphism is similar in P. cretica and P. multifida. Germination occurs following the Vittaria type, 3-7 days after the sowing. Filamentous, 3-5 celled gametophytes were found in P. cretica, P. multifida and P. vittata, and 7-9 celled in P. ensiformis. Development of gametophytes takes place following Adiantum type and Ceratopteris type. The symmetry of the laminae differ in gametophytes, those of P. ensiformis and P. multifida are similar and differ from the other two species, P. cretica and P. vittata. Gametophytes of P. ensiformis, P. multifida and P. vittata are bisexual and protandric, while male gametophytes were found in P. cretica. Antheridia correspond to the common leptosporangiate type; they are cylindric in P. vittata and ovoid in the other three species. Archegonia necks have 4 rows of 4 cells each. The sporophytes complete their development 3 months after sowing, and have indument close to the adult plants. P. cretica shows obligated apogamy.</str>

The DNA hydrolysate is first separated into a low and a high molecular weight mixture of pyrimidine nucleotides by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The nucleoside bisphosphates pdCp and pdTp, the dinucleotides p(dC)2 and p(dT)2 and the sequence isomers p(dC, dT) are largely separated out of the mixture of the low molecular weight pyrimidine nucleotides. The remaining mixture is rechromatographed at pH 3.5 on QAE-Sephadex. This separates the pyrimidine nucleotides containing a majority of cytidylic acid units from those containing more thymidylic acid units, which are then fractionated at pH 7.5 according to the number of bases in the chain. The pyrimidine nucleotides and mixtures of sequence isomers separated to 83-99% purity by column chromatography are further separated by paper chromatography and are obtained in chromatographically pure form after this step. The structures of the isolated DNA fragments are determined from chromatographic data, absorption and enzymatic degradation.</str>

      <str>One hundred and eighty-seven patients with a transitional cell bladder cancer were followed by retrospectively for a mean of 9.5 years. Clinical stage (p less than 0.0001), histological grade (p less than 0.0001), papillary (p less than 0.0001), SPF (p less than 0.0001), M/V index (p less than 0.0001), MAI (p less than 0.0001), DNA index (p = 0.0001) SDNA (p = 0.0004), NA10 (p = 0.0023), NA (p = 0.0044) and G2% (p = 0.0158) were significantly correlated with survival in univariate analysis. In Cox's analysis T-category, papillarity and MAI had independent prognostic value and in combination they predicted bladder cancer-related survival significantly (X2 = 117.5, p less than 0.0001). When histological parameters only were analysed, WHO grade, SPF and papillarity were independent predictors and their combined prognostic significance was high (X2 = 76.6, p less than 0.0001). In papillary tumours SPF (p v 0.0005), MAI (p = 0.0009), DNA index (p = 0.0010) and M/V index (p = 0.0021) predicted survival significantly in addition to stage (P less than 0.0001) and grade (p = 0.0003) in univariate analysis. In Cox's analysis T-category, MAI and M/V index were independent predictors and their combined prognostic value was high (X2 = 54.1, p less than 0.0001). In Ta-T1 and in T2-T3 tumours, WHO grade, papillarity, SPF, mitotic indexes and DI were significant predictors in univariate analysis. In Cox's analysis of Ta-T1 tumours papillarity had independent prognostic value, whereas in papillary Ta-T1 tumours mitotic activity included all prognostic information. In T2-T3 tumours WHO grade and SPF were independent predictors. In conclusion, in papillary bladder tumours T-category is the most important predictor of survival followed by parameters reflecting proliferative activity of cancer cells.</str>

      <str>To quantify the effects of an acute phase response in broilers, chicks were injected with 1 mg/kg Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 15 and 23 d. Lipopolysaccharide injection increased feed/gain (P = 0.03), increased liver weight (P = 0.09), and decreased tibia calcium (P = 0.05) and breaking strength (P &lt; 0.04) by d 28. In a second experiment, 3 d postinjection of chicks at d 31, LPS decreased BW (P &lt; 0.01), breast weight (P = 0.08), and tibia breaking strength (P = 0.05), and increased liver weight (P &lt; 0.01), mortality (P = 0.05), and titers to bronchitis and Mycoplasma gallisepticum that were induced by vaccination at hatch or by field exposure, respectively (P = 0.04). For experiment 3, chicks were challenged with LPS at 23d and 27d. Lipopolysaccharide-injected chicks had decreased BW (P = 0.06), feed consumption (P = 0.05), tibia weight (P&lt; 0.01), and breaking strength (P &lt; 0.01), and increased feed/gain (P &lt; 0.01), liver weight (P &lt; 0.01), and plasma ionized calcium level (P = 0.08).

Experiment 5 compared 4 broiler strains. Strain x LPS interactions were found for bone breaking strength (P = 0.01). Mortality before LPS challenge was inversely correlated to liver weight (r2 = 0.95, P = 0.02) and bone breaking strength (r2 = 0.99, P = 0.01) only after an LPS challenge.</str>

Patients were classified into 2 groups as troponin-negative (&lt;0.2 ng/ml, n=129) or positive (&gt;or=0.2 ng/ml, n=73). Soluble P-selectin concentrations were found to be higher (p&lt;0.001) and correlated with troponin concentrations (r=0.313, p&lt;0.005) in troponin-positive patients with NSTE-ACS. In these patients fibrinogen (p&lt;0.001), plasminogen (p&lt;0.001) and PAI-1 (p&lt;0.026) concentrations were higher and t-PA concentrations were lower (p&lt;0.013) and all these parameters correlated with P-selectin concentrations (p&lt;0.001).

Soluble P-selectin concentrations were found to be an independent predictor of troponin positivity (beta=0.295, odds ratio =1.05, p&lt;0.001).

Individual compounds formed upon digestion of (A2'/3'p)n with binase have been isolated. Their structure was determined on the basis of their chemical and enzymatic conversions and confirmed by 1H-, 13C- and 31P-NMR spectra. According to these data, the circular triadenylate contains one 2'-5' and two 3'-5' internucleotide bonds, linear oligoadenylates of one series contain exclusively 2'-5' internucleotide bonds [(A2'p)nA &gt; p], while each compound of the other series contains a single 3'-5' internucleotide bond connecting the 5'-ultimate nucleotide residue with the penultimate one [A3'p(A2'p)n-1A &gt; p]. The incubation of compounds of the former series A3' p(A2'p)n &gt; p at pH 1.0 and the subsequent action of phosphatase results in successive formation of compounds of two other new series: A3'p(A2'p)nA2'(3')p and A3'p(A2'p)nA.</str>

      <str>Both enzymatic hydrolysis and solution (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been used to characterize P compounds in animal manures. In this study, we comparatively investigated P forms in 0.25 M NaOH/0.05 M EDTA extracts of dairy and poultry manures by the two methods. For the dairy manure, enzymatic hydrolysis revealed that the majority of extracted P was inorganic P (56%), with 10% phytate-like P, 9% simple monoester P, 6% polynucleotide-like P, and 18% non-hydrolyzable P. Similar results were obtained by NMR spectroscopy, which showed that inorganic P was the major P fraction (64-73%), followed by 6% phytic acid, 14 to 22% other monoesters, and 7% phosphodiesters. In the poultry manure, enzymatic hydrolysis showed that inorganic P was the largest fraction (71%), followed by 15% phytate-like P and 1% other monoesters, and 3% polynucleotide-like P. NMR spectroscopy revealed that orthophosphate was 51 to 63% of extracted P, phytic acid 24 to 33%, other phosphomonoesters 6 to 12%, and phospholipids and DNA 2% each. Drying process increased orthophosphate (8.4% of total P) in dairy manure, but decreased orthophosphate (13.3% of total P) in poultry manure, suggesting that drying treatment caused the hydrolysis of some organic P to orthophosphate in dairy manure, but less recovery of orthophosphate in poultry manure. Comparison of these data indicates that the distribution patterns of major P forms in animal manure determined by the two methods were similar. Researchers can utilize the method that best fits their specific research goals or use both methods to obtain a full spectrum of manure P characterization.</str>

      <str>An abnormality of serotonergic neurotransmission has been hypothesized in p,p'-DDT intoxication to explain myoclonus and the antimyoclonic properties of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). To study the role of serotonin (5-HT) receptors in myoclonus induced by p,p'-DDT in the rat, we performed time-course and dose-response studies of the effects of p,p'-DDT on behavior and regional 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 binding sites. At a time when low dose (80 mg/kg) p,p'-DDT elicited stimulus-sensitive and spontaneous myoclonus, there were no significant changes in Bmax or Kd of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C sites in cortex, striatum, brainstem or spinal cord, agonist- or antagonist-labelled 5-HT2 sites in cortex, or 5-HT uptake sites. High dose p,p'-DDT (1000 but not 500 mg/kg), which also induced convulsions, only slightly increased 5-HT1 (unsubtyped) binding sites in cortex but not in brainstem or spinal cord and had no effect on antagonist-labelled 5-HT2 sites. In naive frontal cortex in vitro, 1 microM p,p'-DDT displaced neither [3H]5-HT or [3H]ketanserin specific binding. Lesions of central indoleamine neurons made with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine significantly prolonged the latency and attenuated the severity of p,p'-DDT behavioral abnormalities, increasing the dose of p,p'-DDT which induced myoclonus (MD50) or convulsions (CD50) in 50 percent of the rats. This is the first report of 5,7-DHT-induced attenuation in the p,p'-DDT myoclonic model.</str>

      <str>Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of Bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, Prevotella. The non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. A polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. Reference strains of P. oralis, P. veroralis, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. buccae, P. zoogleoformans, P. bivia, P. disiens, P. oulora, B. (P.) capillus and B. (P.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by SDS-PAGE. There was close correlation between patterns of results in biochemical and GLC tests and the SDS-PAGE profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in SDS-PAGE. The periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by SDS-PAGE; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. By SDS-PAGE, clinical isolates of P. buccae (42 isolates) and P. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. However, for P. veroralis (15), P. oris (7), P. bivia (4), P. zoogleoformans (2) and P. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. Twelve isolates remained undesignated in SDS-PAGE analysis. Variant SDS-PAGE profiles divided clinical isolates of P. buccae into two subgroups and those of P. veroralis into five subgroups.</str>

After being diluted with water, plasma, liver and brain samples were applied to a solid-phase extraction C18 cartridge. The extraction containing p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE from the cartridge were cleaned-up using a Florisil Sep-Pak cartridge. The samples were analyzed by HPLC using UV detection at 238 nm. The limit of detection for p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE was 0.1 mg kg(-1) liver or brain and 0.1 mg l(-1) plasma. For six replicate samples at 40, 4 and 0.2 mg kg(-1), intra-day precision values were within 4.9% for plasma, 6.4% for liver, and 9.7% for brain. Inter-day precision values at 4 mg kg(-1) were within 8.2% for plasma and tissues. The method performances were shown to be selective for p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, and linear over the range 0.04-12 mg kg(-1) (mg L(-1) for plasma). The absolute recoveries of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in rat plasma and tissues were over 92%. The method was proved to be applicable to the pharmacokinetic study of DDT in rats after a single oral administration.</str>

      <str>Different doses of rac-p-HPPH (0.4 and 4 mg/h) were given repeatedly to rats infused with [14C]phenytoin. The serum levels of 14C-labeled and unlabeled p-HPPH, and [14C]phenytoin were measured by an HPLC method and radiometric analysis. The clearance of phenytoin and p-HPPH was determined by rate of dosing divided by the steady-state concentration. The phenytoin clearance was significantly lower in the high dose p-HPPH injection group than in the low dose group (87 versus 262 ml/h), whereas p-HPPH clearance showed no difference. The formation clearance of [14C]p-HPPH was also significantly lower in rats injected with high dose of p-HPPH (35 versus 169 ml/h). The clearance of other elimination pathways was also lower in rats with high dose of p-HPPH (53 versus 89 ml/h). The serum protein binding of phenytoin was lower in rats injected with high dose of p-HPPH. The result indicated that injections of rac-p-HPPH mainly inhibited on the formation of p-HPPH itself. The formation of (R)-p-HPPH and (S)-p-HPPH in microsomal preparation was measured by a ligand-exchange chromatographic method. The formation of (S)-p-HPPH or (R)-p-HPPH was not only inhibited by the enantiomer itself, but also cross-inhibited by the other enantiomer. To the formation of either (S)-p-HPPH or (R)-p-HPPH, (S)-p-HPPH showed a higher inhibitory activity. The use of rac-p-HPPH to inhibit phenytoin metabolism in vivo involved several mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Among 1004 patients, 137 (14 %) were &lt; or = 45 years. Younger patients were more commonly female (57 % versus 34 %; p &lt; 0.0001), had a lower frequency of diabetes (1 % versus 15 %; p &lt; 0.0001), hypercholesterolemia (26 % versus 56 %; p &lt; 0.0001), hypertension (19 % versus 65 %; p &lt; 0.0001), coronary heart disease (14 % versus 40 %; p &lt; 0.0001), and a lower mean Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI), (0.18 versus 0.84; p &lt; 0.0001). Tobacco use was more prevalent in the young (39 % versus 26 %; P &lt; 0.0001).

      <str>The study aimed to compare the fall characteristics between parkinsonian single (P-SF) and recurrent fallers (P-RF), and the clinical features among parkinsonian non-fallers (P-NF), P-SF, P-RF and age-matched healthy controls. As many as 72 patients with PD and 74 healthy subjects completed the study. Each subject was evaluated for gait speed, timed up-and-go test, one-leg-stance test, six-minute walk test, five-times-sit-to-stand test, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale at baseline. Subjects were then followed up for 12 months by telephone interview to record the fall incidence and fall characteristics. Among the PD patients, 12 fell once (P-SF) and 13 fell 2-29 times (P-RF), accounting for a total of 133 falls in the 12-month follow-up period. The most common fall-related activity for both P-SF and P-RF was walking. P-SF fell mostly outdoors due to "tripping", while P-RF mostly fell at home due to "muscle giving way". Clinical measures indicated that P-SF did not differ from P-NF. However, P-RF had significantly longer five-times-sit-to-stand time, shorter 6-min walk distance, and lower ABC score than P-SF. P-RF could be distinguished from P-SF by fall characteristics (i.e. location and perceived causes of falls), and by clinical measures including leg muscle weakness, reduced exercise endurance and increased level of fear of falling. Findings from the present study suggest that P-NF/P-SF and P-RF may require different intervention strategies to prevent future falls.</str>

      <str>The phosphorylated signal transduction protein P(II) (P(II)-P) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is dephosphorylated by PphA, a protein phosphatase of the 2C family (PP2C). In this study, the physiological conditions of P(II)-P dephosphorylation were investigated with respect to the in vivo specificity of P(II)-P towards PphA and the cellular abundance of PphA in cells growing under different nitrogen regimes. Furthermore, the consequences of impaired P(II)-P dephosphorylation with respect to short-term inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS) were studied. With a contribution of approximately 15 % of total Mn(2+)-dependent p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis activity, PphA has only a minor impact on the total PP2C activity in Synechocystis extracts. Nevertheless, residual P(II)-P dephosphorylation in PphA-deficient cells could only be observed after prolonged incubation in the presence of ammonium. The abundance of PphA correlates with the phosphorylation state of P(II) under nitrogen-replete conditions and is specifically enhanced by nitrite. Regulation of pphA expression operates at the post-transcriptional level. In the presence of nitrate/nitrite, PphA is present in molar excess over P(II)-P, enabling the cells to rapidly dephosphorylate P(II)-P in response to changing environmental conditions. A PphA-deficient mutant is not impaired in short-term inhibition of GS activity following ammonium treatment. Down-regulation of GS occurs by induction of gif genes (encoding GS inactivating factors 7 and 17), which is controlled by NtcA-mediated gene repression. Thus, impaired P(II)-P dephosphorylation does not affect ammonium-prompted inactivation of NtcA.</str>

      <str>We conducted solution hybridization and Northern blot experiments utilizing synthetic 18'-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to two major rat hepatic phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450s, P-450b and P-450e, to assess their mRNA expression during rat development. At all ages studied, with one exception (i.e. in day 22 neonates), P-450b mRNA was not detected in control animals. However, traces of P-450e message were observed in control animals on day 22 and persisted to adulthood. Phenobarbital pretreatment caused marked increases in hepatic mRNA for both P-450s as early as 22 days after conception. No increases were observed in RNA isolated from phenobarbital-pretreated day 10 or 19 rats. In general, the inducible levels of P-450b and P-450e mRNA increased as a function of age. The age-dependent increase in responsiveness to phenobarbital was associated with an age-dependent decrease in the ratio of P-450b to P-450e mRNA levels. The levels of P-450b/P-450e varied from a ratio of 19 at day 22 of development to a ratio of 5 at day 62 of development. Maximal levels of phenobarbital-induced hepatic RNA for both isozymes occurred 24 days after birth (day 46 of development), at which time P-450b and P-450e mRNAs accumulated to levels 2.4- and 1.8-fold greater, respectively, than levels found in comparably induced adult rat liver. Northern blot analyses indicated that the major mRNA species hybridizing to either the P-450b or P-450e oligomers in all age groups studied was approximately 1.8 kilobases.</str>

      <str>To assess whether the known pulsatility of P secretion by the corpus luteum, which is detected in blood by P measurements, translates into fluctuations of saliva P concentrations, and to determine how well saliva P measurements reflect plasma P concentration. A second objective was to see whether there is a window in the luteal phase, where P secretion has reached its maximum capacity, but the amplitude is not very accentuated, which would be an ideal time to measure P.</str>
      <str>Twenty-one ovulatory women were randomly assigned to be studied on day 5, 7, or 8 after the luteinizing hormone surge. Blood samples were drawn every 20 minutes, and saliva samples were obtained hourly over a 24-hour period. Comparison between saliva plasma P was performed, and pulse analysis of plasma P was done.</str>
      <str>The percent variation of saliva P concentration over a 24-hour period was much higher when compared with the percent variation of plasma P concentration over the same time period (saliva P: 149%; plasma P: 107%). Also, the ratio of saliva to plasma P varied significantly between individuals (range: 0.0050 to 0.0148). A single plasma P concentration (8:00 A.M.) correlated better with the 24-hour mean plasma concentration than the respective single saliva value or the mean of two or three saliva samples (8:00 A.M. and 12:00 P.M.; 8:00 A.M., 12:00 P.M., and 8:00 P.M.). Plasma pulse frequency, mean pulse interval, pulse width, pulse amplitude, and 24-hour mean P level did not differ between the 3 study days.</str>
      <str>A single plasma P determination reflects more accurately 24-hour P secretion than repeated saliva P samples measured in the same individual. We could not identify a window in the luteal phase when P measurements are more representative of corpus luteum function.</str>

      <str>The molecular genetic basis of the P histo-blood group system has eluded characterization despite extensive studies of the biosynthesis of the P(1), P, and P(k) glycolipids. The main controversy has been whether a single or two distinct UDP-Gal:Galbeta1-R 4-alpha-galactosyltransferases catalyze the syntheses of the structurally related P(1) and P(k) antigens. The P(1) polymorphism is linked to 22q11.3-ter. Data base searches with the coding region of an alpha4GlcNAc-transferase identified a novel homologous gene at 22q13.2 designated alpha4Gal-T1. Expression of full coding constructs of alpha4Gal-T1 in insect cells revealed it encoded P(k) but not P(1) synthase activity. Northern analysis showed expression of the transcript correlating with P(k) synthase activity and antigen expression in human B cell lines. Transfection of P(k)-negative Namalwa cells with alpha4Gal-T1 resulted in strong P(k) expression. A single homozygous missense mutation, M183K, was found in six Swedish individuals of the rare p phenotype, confirming that alpha4Gal-T1 represented the P(k) gene. Sequence analysis of the coding region of alpha4Gal-T1 in P(1)+/- individuals did not reveal polymorphisms correlating with P(1)P(2) typing.</str>

      <str>Establishment and maintenance of a lysogen of the lambdoid bacteriophage 434 require that the 434 repressor both activate transcription from the P(RM) promoter and repress transcription from the divergent P(R) promoter. Several lines of evidence indicate that the 434 repressor activates initiation of P(RM) transcription by occupying a binding site adjacent to the P(RM) promoter and directly contacting RNA polymerase. The overlapping architecture of the P(RM) and P(R) promoters suggests that an RNA polymerase bound at P(R) may repress P(RM) transcription initiation. Hence, part of the stimulatory effect of the 434 repressor may be relief of interference between RNA polymerase binding to the P(RM) promoter and to the P(R) promoter. Consistent with this proposal, we show that the repressor cannot activate P(RM) transcription if RNA polymerase binds at P(R) prior to addition of the 434 repressor. However, unlike the findings with the related lambda phage, formation of RNA polymerase promoter complexes at P(RM) and at P(R) apparently are mutually exclusive. We find that the RNA polymerase-mediated inhibition of repressor-stimulated P(RM) transcription requires the presence of an open complex at P(R). Taken together, these results indicate that establishment of an open complex at P(R) directly prevents formation of an RNA polymerase-P(RM) complex.</str>

      <str>Adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells are characteristic of the development of atherosclerotic lesions, but the receptors involved remain to be defined. P-selectin is an adhesion receptor expressed on activated endothelial cells or platelets and was shown to be involved in fatty streak formation in LDL receptor-deficient mice on an atherogenic diet. The main purpose of this study is to examine the role of P-selectin in the spontaneous development of advanced atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice. METHODDS AND RESULTS: We intercrossed P-selectin-deficient mice with mice lacking apoE and compared lesion development in apoE-deficient mice with P-selectin (apoE(-/-) P(+/+)) and without P-selectin (apoE(-/-) P(-/-)) that were fed normal mouse chow. At 4 months of age, apoE(-/-) P(-/-) mice had 3. 5-fold smaller aortic sinus lesions than apoE(-/-) P(+/+) mice. These were limited to fatty streaks in the apoE(-/-) P(-/-) mice, whereas 70% of apoE(-/-) P(+/+) lesions contained smooth muscle cells. Significantly more of the aortic sinus circumference was covered by lesions in the apoE(-/-) P(+/+) animals. The P-selectin genotype affected macrophage recruitment, because twice as many mononuclear cells were present in the P-selectin-positive lesions. At 15 months, the lesions progressed to the fibrous plaque stage in both genotypes and spread throughout the aorta, but this process was delayed in apoE(-/-) P(-/-) mice. In the aortic sinus, the lesions of the apoE(-/-) P(-/-) mice were 2.6-fold smaller and less calcified.</str>

      <str>In Drosophila melanogaster, some clusters of P transgenes ( P-lacZ-white) display a variegating phenotype for the white marker in the eye, a phenomenon termed "Repeat-Induced Gene Silencing" (RIGS). We have tested the influence of the P element repression state (P cytotype) on the eye phenotype of several P-lac-w clusters that differ in transgene copy number or genomic insertion site. P element-encoded regulatory products strongly enhance RIGS. The effect occurs in both sexes, is detectable with clusters having at least three copies and is observed at both genomic locations tested (cytogenetic regions 50C and 92E). Single variegating P-lac-w transgenes located in pericentromeric heterochromatin are not affected by P regulatory products. All P strain backgrounds tested enhance RIGS, including chromosomes bearing a single P element encoding a truncated P transposase or carrying a single internally deleted KP element. Therefore, clusters are highly sensitive to different types of P repressors. Finally, a chimeric gene in which the 5' portion of the P element is fused to the polyhomeotic coding sequence (ph(p1)) also strongly enhances silencing of P-lac-w clusters. These results have implications for the mechanism of action of the P repressors and show that P transgene clusters represent a new class of P-sensitive alleles, providing a simple assay for somatic P repression that can be completed in one generation.</str>

      <str>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), although considered as an independent risk factor for CVD, remains underdiagnosed. The aim of this paper was to determine the prevalence, predictors of CAN in patients with T1D and its association with other chronic complications of diabetes. Patients with T1D underwent a clinical-epidemiological survey, had blood and urinary samples collected, performed ophthalmoscopic and clinical neurological examination and cardiovascular reflex tests. One hundred and fifty one patients with T1D, 53.6% female, 45.7% Caucasian, mean age of 33.4 ± 13 years, diabetes duration of 16.3 ± 9.5 years, and glycated hemoglobin levels of 9.1 ± 2% were evaluated. The prevalence of CAN in the studied population was 30.5%. CAN was associated with age (p = 0.01), diabetes duration (p = 0.036), hypertension (p = 0.001), resting heart rate (HR) (p = 0.000), HbA1c (p = 0.048), urea (p = 0.000), creatinine (p = 0.008), glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.000), urinary albumin concentration (p = 0.000), LDL (p = 0.048), free T4 (p = 0.023), hemoglobin (p = 0.01) and presence of retinopathy (p = 0.000), nephropathy (p = 0.000) and diabetic neuropathy (p = 0.000), the following symptoms syncope (p = 0.000), post prandial nausea (p = 0.042), early satiety (p = 0.031), sexual dysfunction (p = 0.049), and gustatory sweating (p = 0.018). In logistic regression model, it was observed that only resting HR, diabetic neuropathy, and retinopathy were independent associated with CAN. In conclusion, CAN is a common chronic complication of T1D affecting about 30% of the studied population and is associated with the presence of other chronic complications. Indicators of CAN included age, diabetes duration, hypertension, resting HR, diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy, and symptoms suggestive of autonomic neuropathy. This study confirms the importance of systematic and early screening for CAN. </str>

      <str>The seasonal differences were found in phosphorus (P = 0.001), creatinine before HD (P &lt;0.001), creatinine after HD (P = 0.005), alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.012), alanine aminotransferase (P = 0.042), urea before HD (P = 0.039), albumins (P &lt;0.001), total cholesterol (P &lt;0.001), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P &lt;0.001), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P &lt;0.001), glucose (P = 0.033), and ultrafiltration per HD (P = 0.037). When the data were grouped into cold (March and December) and mild (June and September) months, we found differences in phosphorus (1.48 +/- 0.47 versus 1.72 +/- 0.51, P = 0.005), alkaline phosphatase (119.46 +/- 69.03 versus 169.78 +/- 107.98, P = 0.002), urea before HD (27.13 +/- 5.35 versus 24.40 +/- 5.99, P = 0.006), albumins (37.92 +/- 5.17 versus 40.58 +/- 5.69, P = 0.006), total cholesterol (4.93 +/- 0.93 versus 5.30 +/- 0.93, P = 0.023), LDL cholesterol (2.85 +/- 1.04 versus 3.23 +/- 0.87, P = 0.046), glucose (4.62 +/- 1.15 versus 5.57 +/- 1.46, P = 0.004), and ultrafiltration per HD (3.57 +/- 1.18 versus 2.97 +/- 1.20, P = 0.004).</str>
      <str>In Mediterranean climates, seasonal differences in predialysis urea concentration and ultrafiltration rate per dialysis could be attributed to different food and water intake. The seasonal differences in blood concentration of phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and glucose might be the results of neurohormonal influences. This climate has no impact on haemoglobin and blood pressure levels.</str>

      <str>To study the association between obesity and P-wave duration and dispersion (P(d)) in order to evaluate the potential risk for atrial fibrillation development in Chinese subjects using the definitions applied for Asian populations.</str>
      <str>The study population consisted of 40 obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 25 Kg/m(2), according to the World Health Organization classification for the Asian population) subjects and 20 age- and sex-matched normal weight controls. Maximum P-wave duration (P(max)), minimum P-wave duration (P(min)), and P(d) were carefully measured using a 12-lead electrocardiogram, while the presence of interatrial block (IAB; P &gt; or = 110 ms) was assessed.</str>
      <str>There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, sex, history of hypertension or diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Compared to controls, BMI, left atrial diameter (LAD), and interventricular septal thickness were increased, while P(max) (111.9 +/- 9.3 vs 101.1 +/- 6.0 ms, P &lt; 0.01) and P(d) (47.9 +/- 9.3 vs 31.8 +/- 6.9 ms, P &lt; 0.01) were significantly prolonged in the obese group. P(min) was similar between the two groups. The prevalence of IAB was significantly greater in the obese subjects. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that there were positive correlations between P(d) and BMI (r = 0.6, P &lt; 0.001), as well as between P(d) and LAD (r = 0.366, P &lt; 0.05).</str>
      <str>Our data suggest that obesity is associated with increased P(max) and P(d), and increased prevalence of IAB, parameters that have been associated with atrial fibrillation. The correlation of these electrocardiogram parameters with LAD indicates an association between increased BMI and atrial remodeling in Asian subjects.</str>

      <str>Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (odds ratio 2.1 [95% CI 1.3-3.4], P=.003), gestational age at PPROM (P=.025), prolonged rupture of membranes (P&lt;.0001), administration of tocolytic agents (1.8 [1.1-3.0], P=.019) and antibiotics (1.9 [1.2-3.1], P=.008) were associated with PVL. The use of tocolytic agents &gt;24 h (P=.008), prolonged latency between the increase in maternal leukocyte count and birth (P=.034), spontaneous onset of labor (1.8 [1.0-2.9], P=.026), vaginal delivery (1.7 [1.1-2.8], P=.029) and male gender (1.5 [1.0-2.0], P=.04) were found more frequently in PVL cases. Preeclampsia (0.4 [0.1-0.9], P=.034), hypertension at booking (P=.009), sonographic IUGR (P=.020), abnormal blood flow of the umbilical artery (P=.032) and cesarean section without labor (0.5 [0.3-0.8], P=.006) were found less frequently.

      <str>(Pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) is a specific receptor for both renin and its precursor prorenin. (P)RR was shown to be involved in pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Soluble (pro)renin receptor (s(P)RR), which is generated by furin from full length (P)RR, is present in blood. The aim of the present study is to clarify the association of plasma s(P)RR levels and the severity of OSAS. Plasma levels of s(P)RR were measured by ELISA in 58 male patients diagnosed as OSAS based on polysomnography, and 14 age-matched male control subjects. Blood samples were obtained at 6:00 a.m. just after overnight polysomnography. Plasma s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in patients with OSAS (9.0±2.0 ng/mL, mean ± SD) than in control subjects (7.4±1.5 ng/mL) (P=0.0026). Plasma s(P)RR levels showed a significant negative correlation with % stage rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (r=-0.377, p&lt;0.005), and significant positive correlations with % stage 1 (r=0.374, p&lt;0.005), arousal index (r=0.341, p&lt;0.01), apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (r=0.352, p&lt;0.01) and desaturation index (r=0.302, p&lt;0. 05). In 12 OSAS patients with AHI ≥20, plasma levels of s(P)RR were studied after 3-month treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). Plasma s(P)RR levels were significantly decreased after the nCPAP treatment (p=0.0016). The present study has shown for the first time elevated plasma s(P)RR levels in patients with OSAS. Plasma s(P)RR levels were associated with the severity of OSAS. Soluble (P)RR may serve as a plasma marker reflecting the severity of OSAS.</str>

      <str>Four steroid 21-hydroxylase B [P-450(C21)B] genes (designated P.7, P.10-1, P.10-2, and P.3) from three P-450(C21)-deficient patients were isolated to analyze their structures and functions. Several base changes were observed in the sequences of the four P-450(C21)B genes as compared to that of the functional B gene. Many of these base changes were identical to those of the P-450(C21)A pseudogene. The three DNAs (P.10-1, P.10-2, and P.3) produced no P-450(C21) activity in a functional assay for P-450(C21) by the COS cell expression system, while the P.7 DNA expressed the activity. The P.10-1 and P.10-2 DNAs were shown to have a point mutation in the second intron, causing aberrant splicing. The P.3 DNA carried three clustered missense mutations in the sixth exon, which impaired P-450(C21) activity. All these critical mutations could be seen in the corresponding site of the P-450(C21)A pseudogene. These data strongly suggest the involvement of gene conversion in this genetic disease.</str>

The effects of vehicle alone (0.1% ethanol), the positive control 17-β-E2 (10(-5) M) and p-NP (10(-9) M, 10(-8) M, 10(-7) M, 10(-6) M) on spontaneous and KCl-induced uterine contractility of rats were studied. Also, the effects of p-NP in combination with actinomycin D (10(-5) M) (gene transcription inhibitor), cycloheximide (10(-4) M) (protein synthesis inhibitor), fulvestrant (10(-6) M) (pure estrogen receptor antagonist), 2-hydroxy-5-nonanoylbenzamide (10(-3) M) (compound 1b, anti-uterotrophic compound) on spontaneous uterine contractions, and with propranolol (20 µM) (β-adrenoceptor antagonist) and noradrenaline (5 µM) on KCl (40 mM) induced contractions were investigated. p-NP exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition on spontaneous uterine contractions. There was no significant difference between the highest p-NP concentration (10(-6) M) and the positive control 17-β-E2 in terms of % inhibition (p&gt;0.05). The inhibitory effect of p-NP (10(-6) M) on spontaneous contractions was blocked by actinomycin D (p&lt;0.001), cycloheximide (p&lt;0.001), fulvestrant (p&lt;0.001) and compound 1b (p&lt;0.001). 17-β-E2 (10(-5) M) exerted a higher inhibition % on KCl induced contractions than p-NP (10(-6) M). The relaxant effect of p-NP on KCl-induced uterine contractions was inhibited by noradrenaline (p&lt;0.05) but not by propranolol (p&gt;0.05). We suggest that p-NP inhibited uterine contractions similar as 17-β-E2 and genomic pathways are involved and β-adrenoceptors might modulate the activity of p-NP. In addition, compound 1b showed an uterotonic activity and reversed the effect of p-NP. </str>

      <str>A major form of pulmonary cytochrome P-450 (pulmonary P-450MC) was purified approximately 313 fold from lung microsomes of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC)-treated rats. The purified preparation contained 12.5 nmol of cytochrome P-450 per mg protein and was essentially free from NADPH-cytochrome c-reductase, NADH-cytochrome b5-reductase, and cytochrome b5. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of pulmonary P-450MC was estimated to be 54,000, which is smaller than that of a major form of hepatic cytochrome P-450 (hepatic P-450MC) purified from MC-treated rats. The peptide patterns of the purified pulmonary P-450MC were apparently different from those of hepatic P-450MC on partial proteolysis with either S. aureus V8 protease or papain, indicating that the primary structure of pulmonary P-450MC is different from that of hepatic P-450MC. In reconstituted systems, pulmonary P-450MC efficiently catalyzed benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation and ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation, but showed a low activity for benzphetamine N-demethylation. Pulmonary P-450MC formed a single precipitation line with the antibody prepared against hepatic P-450MC in Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis. The pulmonary and hepatic P-450MC activities of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation and ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation were inhibited in the same manner by the antibody against hepatic P-450MC. These results suggest that pulmonary P-450MC is immunologically very similar to hepatic P-450MC.</str>

      <str>P-Selectin expressed on endothelial cells contributes to acute and chronic inflammation by promoting leukocyte tethering/rolling. Despite increasing evidence of P-selectin expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro, the regulatory mechanisms of P-selectin expression on dermal endothelial cells in skin diseases are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate increased expression of P-selectin in dermal vessels of regional skin in urticaria and atopic dermatitis. The present in vitro analyses with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) revealed that histamine rapidly induced P-selectin expression. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 induced prolonged expression of surface P-selectin by HDMECs. A combination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-4 inhibited P-selectin expression. Pretreatment of HDMECs with tumor necrosis factor-alpha followed by incubation with IL-4 markedly increased P-selectin expression. Notably, incubation with substance P alone induced prolonged P-selectin expression. Activation of STAT6 appears to be a key factor in P-selectin expression induced by substance P and IL-4 because treatment with STAT6 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides significantly inhibited P-selectin expression. The present results indicate that novel, complex mechanisms are involved in endothelial P-selectin expression in the skin. STAT6 in dermal endothelial cells appears to be a potent target for controlling cellular infiltrate in allergic and/or neuroinflammatory skin diseases.</str>

      <str>Push/pull hemodiafiltration (HDF) is characterized by alternate repetition of filtration and backfiltration during hemodialysis with high-flux membrane. In the pressure-controlled push/pull (PC P/P) HDF system, which is the newest push/pull HDF system, there are about 25 repetitions of dilution and concentration of the blood while it passes through the hemodiafilter. Hence, the PC P/P is functionally close to the predilution mode of on-line HDF. In the PC P/P, body fluid is replaced usually by more than 120 L of dialysate during the 4 h treatment. In selecting a hemodiafilter for PC P/P, one must be certain that the blood flow channels in the hemodiafilter do not collapse by the positive pressure on the dialysate side in the backfiltration phase. Thus, the polyacrylonitrile hollow-fiber hemodiafilter and polysulfon hollow-fiber hemodiafilter are suitable for PC P/P. In the short term, PC P/P has been reported to be effective against joint pain, itchiness, insomnia, irritability, and restless leg syndrome experienced by hemodialysis patients. Midterm clinical effectiveness of PC P/P includes the requisite lowering of the erythropoietin dose and improvement in skin pigmentation. The albumin loss per treatment with the PC P/P was significantly lower than that with the conventional HDF approach when a protein-permeable membrane is used. In terms of the removal rate of prolactin, no significant difference was found between PC P/P and conventional HDF. On the other hand, the removal rates of myoglobin and beta2M, where molecular size was smaller than prolactin, was significantly greater with the PC P/P than with conventional HDF.</str>

In this study, therefore, we observed the effects of p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT and its major metabolite p,p'-DDE on the differentiation and survival of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. After stimulation with nerve growth factor, PC12 cells exhibited remarkable neurite outgrowth, suggesting that neuronal differentiation was induced by this growth factor. p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT suppressed this neurite outgrowth dose dependently, and p,p'-DDE also revealed a similar effect but to a lesser extent. Apoptotic cell death was induced within 3-6 h after treatment with p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT. Again p,p'-DDE showed a weaker apoptosis-inducing effect. In the organochlorine-treated PC12 cells phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was upregulated, whereas phosphorylation bands were not detected in any kinases of other MAPK groups such as p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. A kinase assay on p44/42 MAPK revealed that the extent of phosphorylation of Elk-1 substrates well correlated with the suppressive effect on neuronal differentiation and apoptosis-inducing activity. These results suggest that p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT exerted their effects on neuronal cells by the stimulation of p44/42 MAPK, and p,p'-DDE had less effects than the other two organochlorines.</str>

      <str>Temporal variations in sediment phosphorus (P) composition and mobility were estimated in surface sediments of accumulation (core PS509 44 cm) and erosion (core PS2009 30 cm) areas of the shallow, large Lake Peipsi sensu stricto (s.s.; 2611 km(2), unregulated water level). The P pool in sediments including buried and mobile P is evaluated for the first time, which will provide baseline data for the future modelling of internal loading in L. Peipsi. Five sedimentary P fractions (including inorganic and nonreactive P) were separately quantified: loosely adsorbed and pore-water P (NaCl-P); redox-sensitive fraction P (NaBD-P); P bound to oxides of non-reducible Fe and Al (NaOH-P); calcium-bound P, mainly from apatite minerals (HCl-P) and refractory, mainly organic P (Res-P). Concentrations of P fractions varied during the 100 years with the highest values around 2007-2008 and 1923-1935. The P in "active" layers that are available for bacteria and algae or those undergoing changes and diagenetic transformations in the sediment could follow sediments with the water content of ∼88%. Potentially mobile P is not decreased in the sediments deposited 50-100 years ago and makes up ca 63 mg m(-2) y(-1) (with range 8.3-23.7% of the total P (TP)) in the accumulation area, and ca 0.047 mg cm(-3) (with range 1.3-22.4% of TP) in the erosion area. The result shows that 13-60% of TP contained in the surface sediment (from 34 to 398 mg P m(-2) y(-1)) has been remobilised during accumulation and could be exported to the overlying water.</str>

      <str>The subsite specificity of rat nardilysin was investigated using fluorogenic substrates of the type 2-aminobenzoyl-GGX(1)X(2)RKX(3)GQ-ethylenediamine-2,4- dinitrophenyl, where P(2), P(2)', and P(3) residues were varied. (The nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (Schechter, I., and Berger, A. (1967) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 27, 157-162) is used where cleavage of a peptide occurs between the P(1) and P(1)' residues, and adjacent residues are designated P(2), P(3), P(2)', P(3)', etc.) There was little effect on K(m) among different residues at any of these positions. In contrast, residues at each position affected k(cat), with P(2) residues having the greatest effect. The S(3), S(2), and S(2)' subsites differed in their amino acid preference. Tryptophan and serine, which produced poor substrates at the P(2) position, were among the best P(2)' residues. The specificity at P(3) was generally opposite that of P(2). Residues at P(2), and to a lesser extent at P(3), influenced the cleavage site. At the P(2) position, His, Phe, Tyr, Asn, or Trp produced cleavage at the amino side of the first basic residue. In contrast, a P(2) Ile or Val produced cleavage between the dibasic pair. Other residues produced intermediate effects. The pH dependence for substrate binding showed that the enzyme prefers to bind a protonated histidine. A comparison of the effect of arginine or lysine at the P(1)' or P(1) position showed that there is a tendency to cleave on the amino side of arginine and that this cleavage produces the highest k(cat) values.</str>

      <str>Excessive fertilizer and manure phosphorus (P) inputs to soils elevates P in soil solution and surface runoff, which can lead to freshwater eutrophication. Runoff P can be related to soil test P and P sorption saturation, but these approaches are restricted to a limited range of soil types or are difficult to determine on a routine basis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether easily measurable soil characteristics were related to the soil phosphorus requirements (P(req), the amount of P sorbed at a particular solution P level). The P(req) was determined for 18 chemically diverse soils from sorption isotherm data (corrected for native sorbed P) and was found to be highly correlated to the sum of oxalate-extractable Al and Fe (R2 &gt; 0.90). Native sorbed P, also determined from oxalate extraction, was subtracted from the P(req) to determine soil phosphorus limits (PL, the amount of P that can be added to soil to reach P(req)). Using this approach, the PL to reach 0.2 mg P L(-1) in solution ranged between -92 and 253 mg P kg(-1). Negative values identified soils with surplus P, while positive values showed soils with P deficiency. The results showed that P, Al, and Fe in oxalate extracts of soils held promise for determining PL to reach up to 10 mg P L(-1) in solution (leading to potential runoff from many soils). The soil oxalate extraction test could be integrated into existing best management practices for improving soil fertility and protecting water quality.</str>

      <str>Soils that receive large applications of animal wastes and sewage sludge are vulnerable to releasing environmentally significant concentrations of dissolved P available to subsurface flow owing to the gradual saturation of the soil's P sorption capacity. This study evaluated P sorption (calculated from Langmuir isotherms) and availability of P (as CaCl2-P and resin P) in soils incubated for 20 d with poultry litter, poultry manure, cattle slurry, municipal sewage sludge, or KH2PO4, added on a P-equivalent basis (100 mg P kg(-1)). All the P sources had a marked negative effect on P sorption and a positive effect on P availability in all soils. In the cattle slurry- and KH2PO4-treated soils, the decreases in P sorption maximum (19-66%) and binding energy (25-89%) were consistently larger than the corresponding decreases (7-41% and 11-30%) in poultry litter-, poultry manure-, and sewage sludge-treated soils. The effects of cattle slurry and KH2PO4 on P availability were, in most cases, larger than those of the other P sources. In the poultry litter, poultry manure, and sewage sludge treatments, the increase in soil solution P was inversely related (R2 = 0.75) to the input of Ca from these relatively high Ca (13.5-42 g kg(-1)) sources. Correlation analyses implied that the magnitude of the changes in P sorption and availability was not related to the water-extractable P content of the P sources. Future research on the sustainable application of organic wastes to agricultural soils needs to consider the non-P- as well as P-containing components of the waste.</str>

      <str>In rat kidney, beta-naphthoflavone induced 53 kDa and 55 kDa proteins, which were both recognized by the antibodies against rat liver cytochrome P-450 1A1 (55kDa). The major inducible 53 kDa protein was purified from the beta naphthoflavone-treated rat kidney and shown to be a new cytochrome P-450 having a high aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. Purified cytochrome P-450, named P-450KAh, was homogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 53 kDa. The absorption spectra of the oxidized form of P-450KAh showed a Soret peak at 416 nm, a characteristic of low-spin hemoprotein, and the Soret peak of the reduced cytochrome P-450-CO complex was at 446 nm. In the reconstituted system, purified P-450KAh showed high catalytic activity for benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation. P-450KAh could activate genotoxicities of not only B[a]P, but also 2-acetylaminofluorene and aflatoxin B1 on the umu test. These catalytic properties of P-450KAh were almost the same as those of P-4501A1, a major P-450 form having arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase in liver microsomes of 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats, and P-450KAh could not be distinguished from P-4501A1 even by immunochemical analysis. However, the electrophoretic peptide patterns after alpha-chymotrypsin or trypsin treatment of P-450KAh were different from those of P-4501A1, and the NH2-terminal 11 amino acid sequence of the P-450 was also different from that of P-4501A1 and any other P-450s of rat.</str>

      <str>Hypophysectomy decreased the content of a male specific cytochrome P-450, P-450-male, in male rats, while it expressed P-450-male and completely depressed a female specific cytochrome P-450, P-450-female, in female rats. Intermittent injections of human growth hormone (GH), which mimic the secretion in males, restored P-450-male in hypophysectomized (Hypox) male rats and partially restored P-450-female in Hypox female rats. Continuous infusion of GH, which mimics the female secretion pattern, into Hypox male rats caused a further decrease in P-450-male content, and it caused the expression of P-450-female. In Hypox female rats, the same treatment depressed P-450-male and expressed P-450-female to the level of an intact female. These results indicate that the diurnal changes in the pattern of serum growth hormone level regulate the expression of P-450-male and P-450-female. The activities of testosterone 2 alpha- and 16 alpha-hydroxylases were closely correlated to P-450-male content with the correlation coefficients (r) of 0.955 and 0.929, respectively. Benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation was also correlated to P-450-male content (r = 0.850). Aminopyrine N-demethylation and propoxycoumarin O-depropylation were correlated to less extents (r = 0.692 and r = 0.720), while aniline hydroxylation and O-ethylresorufin O-deethylation were not correlated to P-450-male content. These results indicate that testosterone 2 alpha- and 16 alpha-hydroxylations are closely dependent, but the metabolism of a variety of drugs are dependent to different extents on P-450-male in rat liver microsomes.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus retention in soils is influenced by the form of P added. The potential impact of one P compound on the sorption of other P compounds in soils has not been widely reported. Sorption isotherms were utilized to quantify P retention by benchmark soils from Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina when P was added as inorganic P (Pi) or organic P (beta-D-glucose-6-phosphate, G6P; adenosine 5'-triphosphate, ATP; and myoinositol hexaphosphate, IP6) and to determine whether soil P sorption by these organic P compounds and Pi was competitive. Isotherm supernatants were analyzed for pH and total P using standard protocols, while Pi and organic P compounds were assayed using ion chromatography. Under the controlled conditions of this study, the affinity of all soils for P sources followed the order IP6 &gt; G6P &gt; ATP &gt; Pi. Each organic P source had a different potential to desorb Pi from soils, and the order of greatest to least Pi desorption was G6P &gt; ATP &gt; IP6. Glucose-6-phosphate and ATP competed more directly with Pi for sorption sites than IP6 at greater rates of P addition, but at the lesser rates of P addition, IP6 actually desorbed more Pi. Inositol hexaphosphate was strongly sorbed by all three soils and was relatively unaffected by the presence of other P sources. Decreased total P sorption due to desorption of Pi can be caused by relatively small additions of organic P, which may help explain vertical P movement in manured soils. Sorption isotherms performed using Pi alone did not accurately predict total P sorption in soils.</str>

To survey the effects of p,p'-DDE on gonadal development and gene expressions, male juvenile (20-d post hatch) Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) was exposed to 1, 5, 20, and 100 microg/L p,p'-DDE for two months. Increased hepatosomatic index (HSI) and decreased gonadosomatic index (GSI) were found in the p,p'-DDE-treated groups. Intersex was found in 100 microg/L p,p'-DDE exposure group, as well as 100 ng/L 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) group. By quantitative real-time RT-PCR, it was found that gene expressions of vitellogenins (VTG-1, VTG-2), choriogenins (CHG-H, CHG-L), and estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) in the liver of the fish were significantly up-regulated byp,p'-DDE exposure. VTG-1 and VTG-2 were recommended as the preferred biomarker for assessing anti-androgenic p,p'-DDE because they were the highest up-regulated among the genes and showed good dose-response relationship. The up-regulated ER-alpha suggested that a potential synergetic effect would occur when p,p'-DDE coexists with other ER-alpha-binding endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs).</str>

      <str>The two eukaryotic fatty-acid hydroxylases P-450Cm2 and P-450Alk3A, which represent CYP52A4 variants naturally occurring in the yeast Candida maltosa, were characterized with respect to their substrate specificity. Whereas P-450Cm2 was found to catalyse lauric acid omega-hydroxylation with greater efficiency, P-450Alk3A had higher palmitic acid turnover numbers compared to P-450Cm2, resulting in ratios of lauric acid to palmitic acid turnover rates of nearly 11 and 3 for P-450Cm2 and P-450Alk3A, respectively. As shown by means of chimeric enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis, the key residue determining these differences in substrate specificity was found to be a single amino acid at position 527. Interestingly, the mutual exchange of valine (P-450Cm2) and leucine (P-450Alk3A) led to a direct transposition of specificity, suggesting that amino acids at this site may determine the efficiency of fatty-acid hydroxylation relatively independently of other active-site residues. This was further supported by the finding that P-450Cm2 and P-450Alk3A with methionine at position 527 displayed almost identical hydroxylation activities. Moreover, methionine to leucine substitutions at the corresponding alignment position in P-450Cm1 (CYP52A3), P-450Alk2A (CYP52A5) and P-450Alk5A (CYP52A9) altered the fatty-acid specificity of these enzymes. In comparison to the structure of the bacterial P-450BM3 (CYP102), we propose that the amino acid at position 527 may serve to close the substrate-binding pocket near to the haem in the fatty-acid-omega-hydroxylating P-450 of the CYP52 family.</str>

Our results are based on numerical solutions of analytical expressions and simulations. We find that as the coupling strength between the two networks q reduces from 1 (fully coupled) to 0 (no coupling), there exist two critical coupling strengths q(1) and q(2), which separate three different regions with different behavior of the giant component as a function of p. (i) For q≥q(1), an abrupt collapse transition occurs at p=p(c). (ii) For q(2)&lt;q&lt;q(1), the giant component has a hybrid transition combined of both, abrupt decrease at a certain p=p(c)(jump) followed by a smooth decrease to zero for p&lt;p(c)(jump) as p decreases to zero. (iii) For q≤q(2), the giant component has a continuous second-order transition (at p=p(c)). We find that (a) for λ≤3, q(1)≡1; and for λ&gt;3, q(1) decreases with increasing λ. Here, λ is the scaling exponent of the degree distribution, P(k)[proportionality]k(-λ). (b) In the hybrid transition, at the q(2)&lt;q&lt;q(1) region, the mutual giant component P(∞) jumps discontinuously at p=p(c)(jump) to a very small but nonzero value, and when reducing p, P(∞) continuously approaches to 0 at p(c)=0 for λ&lt;3 and at p(c)&gt;0 for λ&gt;3. Thus, the known theoretical p(c)=0 for a single network with λ≤3 is expected to be valid also for strictly partial interdependent networks.</str>

      <str>The effects of p,p'-DDE on male reproductive organs were investigated in detail in peripubertal Wistar rats following a single intraperitoneal injection. 220 mg/kg of p,p'-DDE (1/4 of LD50) were injected once into prepubertal and postpubertal Wistar rats and its effects were observed until 20 weeks of age. Weights of the body and reproductive organs in p,p'-DDE-injected rats were similar to those in control rats, who were injected with corn oil only. Sperm profile parameters such as spermatid number within the testis, sperm number within the epididymis, sperm motility and its morphology were not different between the prepubertal or postpubertal p,p'-DDE-exposed group and the control group. Like-wise, the histopathological examination at stage VII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, when the germ cells are sensitive to testosterone, was similar in all three groups during the observation period. Serum levels of testosterone also showed no significant changes by exposure to p,p'-DDE under the conditions of this study. From these results, the antiandrogenic or estrogenic activity attributed to p,p'-DDE was not confirmed in male reproductive organs and no impairment of sperm profile was observed. This study confirmed that the reproductive functions of matured animals are scarcely affected by p,p'-DDE exposure during the peripubertal period and revealed that they might be relatively resistant to exogenous endocrine-disrupting chemicals. p,p'-DDE may threaten the hormonal equilibrium required for normal gonadal development during the organogenesis period, at an earlier stage of life. Further studies are necessary to fully reveal all the effects of p,p'-DDE on male reproductive organs and sperm profile.</str>

      <str>Functional renal failure and cardiovascular dysfunction are common complications of liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to evaluate cardiac performance, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and fluid status in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis either with or without functional renal failure.</str>
      <str>Sixty patients diagnosed as having decompensated liver cirrhosis were divided into two groups. Group 1 included 30 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis with ascites and with creatinine values ≤ 1.5 mg/dl. Group 2 included 30 azotemic decompensated cirrhotic patients with diagnostic criteria of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Also, 20 healthy subjects, of matched age and sex to the Group 1 and Group 2 patients, were included in the study as the control group. All patients and normal controls were subjected to clinical examination, laboratory evaluation, ECG, abdominal ultrasonography and echocardiographic studies.</str>
      <str>The echocardiographic and ECG data showed significant increase in LAD (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01), AoD (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), interventricular septum thickness (IVST) (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01), posterior wall thickness (PWT) (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01), EDD (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01), ESD (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), left ventricular (LV) mass (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01), and Corrected QT (QTc) (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01) interval with significant decrease in SVR (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01). Additionally, there was significant decrease in IVC diameter in both patients groups compared to the control group (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.01).</str>
      <str>Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis have low SVR, and Doppler echocardiography provides an easy noninvasive tool to assess this finding. Also, these patients demonstrate small inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter with normal collapsibility, which indicates low effective plasma volume. Measuring IVC diameter and collapsibility are of value in the prediction of intravascular fluid status in liver cirrhosis. This is especially true with renal dysfunction. Early addition of oral vasoconstrictors in decompensated patients may correct the SVR and circulatory dysfunction and hinder HRS occurrence.</str>

      <str>Substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are colocalized in renal pelvic sensory nerves. Increasing renal pelvic pressure results in an increase in afferent renal nerve activity that is blocked by a substance P receptor antagonist but not by a CGRP receptor antagonist. CGRP potentiates the effects of substance P by preventing the metabolism of substance P. Therefore, we examined whether CGRP enhanced the afferent renal nerve activity responses to substance P and increased renal pelvic pressure, a stimulus known to increase substance P release. Combined administration of substance P and CGRP into the renal pelvis resulted in an increase in afferent renal nerve activity (1392+/-217%. s; area under the curve of afferent renal nerve activity versus time) that was greater (P&lt;0.01) than that produced by substance P (620+/-156%. s) or CGRP (297+/-96%. s) alone. Likewise, CGRP enhanced the afferent renal nerve activity response to increased renal pelvic pressure. During renal pelvic administration of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor thiorphan, the afferent renal nerve activity response to substance P plus CGRP was similar to that produced by either neuropeptide alone. Because these studies suggested that CGRP potentiated the afferent renal nerve activity responses to substance P, we examined whether the afferent renal nerve activity response to CGRP was blocked by a substance P receptor antagonist, RP67580. RP67580 blocked the afferent renal nerve activity response to CGRP by 85+/-12% (P&lt;0.02). We conclude that CGRP activates renal pelvic sensory nerves by retarding the metabolism of substance P, thereby increasing the amount of substance P available for stimulation of substance P receptors.</str>

      <str>The complex doublet potential energy surface for the ion-molecule reaction of HCN(+) with C(2)H(4) is investigated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,2pd) (single-point) levels. The initial association between HCN(+) and C(2)H(4) forms three energy-rich addition intermediates, 1 (HCNCH(2)CH(2)(+)), 2 (HC-cNCH(2)CH(2)(+)), and 3 (N-cCHCH(2)CH(2)(+)), which are predicted to undergo subsequent isomerization and decomposition steps. A total of nine kinds of dissociation products, including P(1) (HCN + C(2)H(4)(+)), P(2) (HCNCHCH(2)(+) + H), P(3) (NCCH(2) + CH(3)(+)), P(4) (CN + C(2)H(5)(+)), P(5) (NCCHCH(2)(+) + H(2)), P(6) (HNCCHCH(2)(+) + H), P(7) (c-CHCCH(2)N(+) + H(2)), P(8) (c-NHCCH(2)C(+) + H(2)), and P(9) (HNCCCH(+) + H(2) + H), are obtained. Among the nine products, P(1) is the most abundant product. P(2) is the second feasible product but is much less competitive than P(1). P(3), P(4), P(5), and P(6) may have the lowest yields observed. Other products, P(7), P(8), and P(9), may become feasible at high temperature. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the most favorable pathway all lie below the reactant, the HCN(+) + C(2)H(4) reaction is expected to be rapid, which is confirmed by experiment. The present calculation results may provide a useful guide for understanding the mechanism of HCN(+) toward other unsaturated hydrocarbons.</str>

      <str>Some findings in standard electrocardiogram (ECG) may be associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the study was to evaluate P wave duration and P wave dispersion (Pdysp) derived from 12-lead standard surface ECG in sinus rhythm in patients with history of AF in comparison to control subjects without AF and with premature ventricular ectopic beats (PVEB).</str>
      <str>The study group consisted of 20 patients (pts), 9M. 11F, mean age 47.6 +/- 5.5 years with paroxysmal AF. The control group consisted of 19 pts, 9M, 10F, mean age 46.7 +/- 4.7 years without history of AF with PVEB. All patients in both groups were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Left atrium dimensions (LA) in the transthoracic echocardiographic examinations (TTE) and maximal (P(max)), minimal (P(min)) wave duration and P(dysp) in a ECG recordings were analyzed. Pdysp was calculated as the difference between P(max) and P(min).</str>
      <str>ECG analysis showed statistically significant differences, study group vs control group in P wave duration and P(dysp). We found that in AF group P(max) and P(dysp) were significantly greater (125.5 vs. 114.5 ms, p &lt; 0.005 and 59.5 vs 45.4 ms, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). LA were significantly greater in AF group (43.7 vs 41.8 mm, p &lt; 0.05). P(dysp) correlated significantly with P(mex) and LA.</str>
      <str>In AF patients, P wave duration and P wave dispersion, in other words atrial depolarization/repolarization inhomogeneity, were increased. A significant positive correlation between P wave dispersion and both Pmax and left atrium size were found.</str>

      <str>The estuarine shrimp Palaemonetes pugio and P. vulgaris co-occur across a broad range in salinity. Field surveys and laboratory lethality tests suggest that low salinity conditions favor P. pugio over P. vulgaris. This study compared energetic expenditures across a range in salinity (0.5-35 ppt) to test the hypothesis that P. pugio experiences lower maintenance-energy requirements than P. vulgaris in low-salinity habitats. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) was measured as the minimum oxygen consumption rate at 25 degrees C to estimate daily maintenance-energy expenditure. SMR was greatest at 0.5 and least at 10 ppt (irrespective of species), and greater for P. vulgaris than for P. pugio. At low salinity (1.5-3 ppt), SMR was lower for P. pugio than for P. vulgaris. Energy expenditure did not coincide with the pattern predicted based upon osmoregulatory costs alone; no reduction was observed near the reported hemolymph concentration for P. vulgaris, although a minimum was observed near the hemolymph isoionic concentration for P. pugio. A local minimum in SMR by P. pugio between 1.5 and 3 ppt contrasted with relatively high SMR of P. vulgaris across this range. It appears that low-salinity habitats are energetically more favorable for P. pugio than for P. vulgaris. The results suggest an adaptive mechanism allowing P. pugio to occupy environments that present its competitor, P. vulgaris, with greater energetic challenges. While long-term exposure to very low salinity may be detrimental to both species, energetic traits of P. pugio may confer it with greater success than P. vulgaris in habitats in which salinity periodically fluctuates to low values.</str>

      <str>Mucins are implicated in survival in various cancers, but there have been no report addressed on survival in appendiceal carcinoma, an uncommon disease with different clinical and pathological features from those of other colon cancers. We aimed to investigate the clinical implications of expression of mucins in appendiceal carcinoma.</str>
      <str>Expression profiles of MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, MUC16 and MUC17 in cancer tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry in 108 cases of surgically resected appendiceal carcinoma.</str>
      <str>The following relationships of mucins with clinicopathologic factors were identified: MUC1 with positive lymphatic invasion (p = 0.036); MUC2 with histological type (mucinous carcinoma, p&lt;0.001), superficial invasion depth (p = 0.007), negative venous invasion (p = 0.003), and curative resection (p = 0.019); MUC3 with non-curative resection (p = 0.017); MUC5AC with histological type (mucinous carcinoma, p = 0.002), negative lymphatic invasion (p = 0.021), and negative venous invasion (p = 0.022); and MUC16 with positive lymph node metastasis (p = 0.035), positive venous invasion (p&lt;0.05), and non-curative resection (p = 0.035). A poor prognosis was related to positive lymph node metastasis (p = 0.04), positive lymphatic invasion (p = 0.02), positive venous invasion (p&lt;0.001), non-curative resection (p&lt;0.001), and positive expression of MUC3 (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, positive venous invasion (HR: 6.93, 95% CI: 1.93-24.96, p = 0.003), non-curative resection (HR: 10.19, 95% CI: 3.05-34.07, p&lt;0.001) and positive MUC3 expression (HR: 3.37, 95% CI: 1.13-10.03, p = 0.03) were identified as significant independent prognostic factors in patients with appendiceal carcinoma.</str>

      <str>The serum concentration of type III procollagen N-terminal peptide (P III P) level is known to reflect the activity of collagen biosynthesis. To analyze the correlation between the disease activity and serum P III P levels in collagen diseases, serum P III P levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), and other collagen diseases were measured. In some patients serum levels of prolyl++-hydroxylase, which is an intra-cellular enzyme of collagen biosynthesis, were measured. Serum P III P levels were elevated in patients with PSS and MCTD/overlap syndrome, suggesting a high rate of collagen biosynthesis by fibroblasts. Patients with RA showed no significant elevation of serum P III P compared with normal control group. But the group of RA patients with elevated ESR and/or serum CRP values showed high levels of serum P III P. The correlation between the disease activity and serum P III P levels was observed in RA patients with positive rheumatoid factor (RF), but not patients without RF. In addition we measured P III P levels in synovial fluid of RA and osteoarthritis patients. The levels were one to three hundred times higher than serum levels, and they showed the positive correlation with serum levels, suggesting that serum P III P might be originated from synovial P III P.</str>

      <str>The comparison of the mean scores at the test and the retest shows that the results at the retest are significantly inferior in both the functional scale (p= 0.013) and the global score (p= 0.006). The test/re-test stability is good (ICC: Functional scale (F): 0.869, Emotional scale (E): 0.846, Physical scale (P): 0.85, Global score (G): 0.878/ Spearman's rho F: 0.855, E: 0.834, P: 0.858, G: 0.886). The internal coherence of each sub scale is good (Cronbach's alpha: &gt; 0.80). The correlation between the 3 subscales is quite high (FvsE: 0,613 /EvsP: 0,737/ FvsP: 0,693) which means that each scale measures a specific dimension but that they are still homogeneous. The test/re-test difference between the singers and the controls are not significant but the control group has a greater variability in their answers (Levene test: F: p&lt;0.001; P: p= 0.009; G: p= 0.02).

      <str>Many studies have found a positive association between the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and DDT exposure. These studies mainly focus on the effect of DDT exposure on cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotion. However, the influence of DDT on cell adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma remains to be unclear. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of p,p'-DDT on cell adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. The data showed that p,p'-DDT, exposing HepG2 cells for 6 days, decreased cell-cell adhesion and elevated cell-matrix adhesion. Strikingly, p,p'-DDT increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, and this was accompanied by the activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, ROS inhibitor supplement reversed these effects significantly. However, the addition of ER inhibitor, ICI, had no effect on the p,p'-DDT-induced effects. p,p'-DDT altered the mRNA levels of related adhesion molecules, including inhibition of E-cadherin and promotion of N-cadherin along with CD29. Interestingly, the p,p'-DDT-altered adhesion molecules could be reversed with JAK inhibitor or STAT3 inhibitor. Likewise, p,p'-DDT stimulated the JAK/STAT3 pathway in nude mice, as well as altered the mRNA levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and CD29. Taken together, these results indicate that p,p'-DDT profoundly promotes the adhesion process by decreasing cell-cell adhesion and inducing cell-matrix adhesion via the ROS-mediated JAK/STAT3 pathway.

      <str>Rabbit antibodies to the phenobarbital (PB) inducible rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450s b and e and to 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) inducible P-450c were used to examine the expression of these isozymes in rat lungs. Western blots of total lung microsomes demonstrated that about 40 pmol P-450b/mg protein (and no detectable P-450e) were present in lungs from control or MC treated rats and that pretreatment with PB caused a small but significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the expression of P-450b. Microsomes from control and PB treated lung contained minimal levels of P-450c, and MC induced this isozyme to 185 pmol/mg. Immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate immunoreactivity to these isozymes in specific cell types. Neither P-450b nor P-450c was detectable in endothelial cells from control or PB treated lungs, but MC increased immunoreactivity to P-450c in pulmonary endothelial cells. Type II alveolar cells showed distinct immunoreactivity to P-450b and weak immunoreactivity to P-450c in control or PB treated rats. Individual Clara cells stained for either P-450c or P-450b in control, MC treated, and PB treated rats, and colocalization was observed in some cells. An increase in type II alveolar cell and Clara cell immunoreactivity to P-450c was observed after MC induction. Mast cells, identified by metachromatic Giemsa staining, appeared to react nonspecifically with both antisera. In conclusion, P-450c is highly inducible by MC in rat lung (detected in microsomes by Western blot), specifically in endothelial cells, Clara cells, and alveolar type II cells (as visualized by immunocytochemistry); and P-450b is present in rat lung microsomes, and immunoreactivity to this isozyme is localized in alveolar type II and Clara cells.</str>

      <str>Plasmodium berghei-infected mice, a well-recognized model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), exhibit many of the hallmarks of a systemic inflammatory response, with organ damage in brain, lung, and kidneys. Identification of the molecules mediating pathogenesis of the inflammatory response, such as leukocyte adhesion, may lead to new therapies. Indeed, mice lacking the cell adhesion molecule P-selectin were significantly (P = 0.005) protected from death due to P. berghei malaria compared with C57BL/6 controls despite similar parasitemia (P = 0.6) being found in both groups of mice. P-selectin levels assessed by the quantitative dual radiolabeled monoclonal antibody technique increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in several organs in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei, supporting the concept of a systemic inflammatory response mediating malarial pathogenesis. Intravital microscopic analysis of the brain microvasculature demonstrated significant (P &lt; 0.001) leukocyte rolling and adhesion in brain venules of P. berghei-infected mice compared with those found in uninfected controls. The maximum leukocyte adhesion occurred on day 6 of P. berghei infection, when the mice become moribund and exhibit marked vascular leakage into the brain, lung, and heart. However, P-selectin levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.005) increased in brain, lung, and kidneys during P. berghei malaria in ECM-resistant BALB/c mice compared with those found in uninfected BALB/c controls, indicating that increased P-selectin alone is not sufficient to mediate malarial pathogenesis. Leukocyte adhesion to brain microvessels of P-selectin-deficient mice with P. berghei malaria was similar to that observed in control mice. Collectively, these results indicate that P-selectin is important for the development of malarial pathogenesis but is not required for leukocyte adhesion in brain.</str>

      <str>Increased interest in ethanol production in North America has led to increased production of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), the majority of which are fed to livestock. To determine the impact of including wheat DDGS in broiler diets on nutrient excretion and P characterization and solubility, 125 one-day-old male broiler chicks were fed wheat- and soybean meal-based diets containing 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20% wheat DDGS. There were 5 replicate pens per treatment, with 5 birds per pen arranged in a randomized block design. Apparent retention of both N and P were determined by using the indicator method. Nutrients excreted per kilogram of DM intake were also calculated. Characterization of excreta P was determined by (31)P-solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and water-soluble P (WSP) was determined by extraction of excreta with deionized water. The apparent retention of both N (P &lt; 0.001) and P (P &lt; 0.008) decreased linearly with increasing inclusion rates of DDGS from 0 to 20%. The nutrient output per kilogram of DM intake increased linearly with increased DDGS inclusion rate for N (P &lt; 0.04), P (P &lt; 0.0001), and WSP (P &lt; 0.0003). As the inclusion rate of DDGS increased, the P concentration in excreta increased (P &lt; 0.008), whereas excreta phytate P concentrations decreased (P &lt; 0.01), which led to an increase in WSP and the fraction of total P that was soluble. Because the inclusion of DDGS in poultry diets increased N and P output, as well as the solubility of P excreted, care should be taken when including high levels of DDGS in poultry diets, because increases in N and P excretion are a concern from an environmental standpoint.</str>

      <str>We have analyzed the conserved regions of the gene coding for the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) in 12 species of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite. The closest evolutionary relative of P. falciparum, the agent of malignant human malaria, is P. reichenowi, a chimpanzee parasite. This is consistent with the hypothesis that P. falciparum is an ancient human parasite, associated with humans since the divergence of the hominids from their closest hominoid relatives. Three other human Plasmodium species are each genetically indistinguishable from species parasitic to nonhuman primates; that is, for the DNA sequences included in our analysis, the differences between species are not greater than the differences between strains of the human species. The human P. malariae is indistinguishable from P. brasilianum, and P. vivax is indistinguishable from P. simium; P. brasilianum and P. simium are parasitic to New World monkeys. The human P. vivax-like is indistinguishable from P. simiovale, a parasite of Old World macaques. We conjecture that P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. vivax-like are evolutionarily recent human parasites, the first two at least acquired only within the last several thousand years, and perhaps within the last few hundred years, after the expansion of human populations in South America following the European colonizations. We estimate the rate of evolution of the conserved regions of the CSP gene as 2.46 x 10(-9) per site per year. The divergence between the P. falciparum and P. reichenowi lineages is accordingly dated 8.9 Myr ago. The divergence between the three lineages leading to the human parasites is very ancient, about 100 Myr old between P. malariae and P. vivax (and P. vivax-like) and about 165 Myr old between P. falciparum and the other two.</str>

PPV without tamponade (group 2). Corneal biomechanical parameters were measured preoperatively and at the first postoperative month by ocular response analyzer. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) and the mean corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) were significantly lower in group 1 than group 2 (p = 0.005, p = 0.002, respectively). The mean preoperative corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 (p = 0.017, p = 0.002, respectively). However, the difference in Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg) between the groups was not significant (p = 0.360). In group 1, IOPcc, IOPg and IOP-GAT significantly increased postoperatively (p = 0.002, p = 0.004, p = 0.002, respectively) but CH and CRF decreased (p = 0.007, p = 0.153, respectively). In group 2, IOPcc, IOPg and IOP (GAT) increased postoperatively but the differences were not significant (p = 0.851, p = 0.693, p = 0.336, respectively). The mean CRF increased significantly (p = 0.026) postoperatively but the decrease in CH was not significant (p = 0.196).

However, the difference in the decreases in CH between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.206). SO tamponade may affect corneal biomechanical parameters in the early postoperative period, which may be related to the surgery itself, SO tamponade or IOP changes.</str>

      <str>Meta-analysis methods that combine P-values into a single unified P-value are frequently employed to improve confidence in hypothesis testing. An assumption made by most meta-analysis methods is that the P-values to be combined are independent, which may not always be true. To investigate the accuracy of the unified P-value from combining correlated P-values, we have evaluated a family of statistical methods that combine: independent, weighted independent, correlated, and weighted correlated P-values. Statistical accuracy evaluation by combining simulated correlated P-values showed that correlation among P-values can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the combined P-value obtained. Among the statistical methods evaluated those that weight P-values compute more accurate combined P-values than those that do not. Also, statistical methods that utilize the correlation information have the best performance, producing significantly more accurate combined P-values. In our study we have demonstrated that statistical methods that combine P-values based on the assumption of independence can produce inaccurate P-values when combining correlated P-values, even when the P-values are only weakly correlated. Therefore, to prevent from drawing false conclusions during hypothesis testing, our study advises caution be used when interpreting the P-value obtained from combining P-values of unknown correlation. However, when the correlation information is available, the weighting-capable statistical method, first introduced by Brown and recently modified by Hou, seems to perform the best amongst the methods investigated.</str>

Am. Chem. Soc.2001, 123, 4107-4118]. To provide information on the structural consequences of propynylation, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was used to study the structures of several oligonucleotides. Intraresidue nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy cross peaks were observed at 30 degrees C and a 200 ms mixing time in the H6-H1' region for 5'(dC(P)C(P)U(P)C(P)C(P)U(P)U(P)) (ssPrODN) but not for 5'(dCCUCCUU) (ssODN), suggesting preorganization of the propynylated single strand. NMR structures of the duplexes 5'(dC(P)C(P)U(P)C(P)C(P)U(P)U(P))3':3'(rGAGGAGGAAAU)5' (PrODN:RNA), 5'(dCC(P)U(P)C(P)C(P)U(P)U(P))3':3'(rGAGGAGGAAAU)5' (sPrODN1:RNA), and 5'(dCCUCCUU)3':3'(rGAGGAGGAAAU)5' (ODN:RNA) indicate that their global structures are almost identical. The NMR data, however, suggest that the 5'-end of sPrODN1:RNA is more dynamic than that of PrODN:RNA. In the propynylated duplexes, the propyne group stacks on the aromatic ring of the 5'-base and extends into the major groove. The results suggest that the increased stability of the propynylated duplexes is caused by preorganization of the propynylated single strand and different interactions in the double strand. The propynyl group provides volume exclusion, enhanced stacking, and possibly different solvation.</str>

      <str>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most leading causes of cancer-related death. Cancer stem cell is responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis and relapse. Sox9 is a pancreatic stem cell marker. PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC is an important signal for maintaining stem cells. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression pattern of Sox9 and p-Akt in human PDAC and its correlation with prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to explore the expression of Sox9 and p-Akt in 88 human PDAC patients. The Pearson's test was used to compare the clinicopathological parameters between negative and positive expressors. The Pearson's correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between Sox9 and p-Akt expression. Kaplan-Meier's method and Cox regression analysis were used to analyze patients' survival. The results showed that Sox9 and p-Akt overactivated in PDAC (p = 0.011, p = 0.008). Sox9-positive expression is significantly associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.046). p-Akt-positive expression is significantly associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.000), TNM stage (0.001) and PCNA expression (p = 0.000). Sox9 expression is positively correlated with p-Akt expression (r = 0.314, p = 0.003). In 54 patients with survival information, both Sox9- and p-Akt-positive expressions are associated with unfavorable prognosis (p = 0.002, p = 0.000). Sox9 and p-Akt double-positive expressor showed much poorer prognosis (p = 0.000). Cox regression analysis showed that Sox9- or p-Akt-positive expression and LN metastasis were independent prognostic factors. This study provides the first evidence that Sox9 and p-Akt are both relevant to distant metastasis and proliferation. Our data suggest the potential of Sox9 and p-Akt as prognostic biomarkers for PDAC. </str>

      <str>Water treatment residuals (WTR) can reduce runoff P loss and surface co-application of P-sources and WTR is a practical way of land applying the residuals. In a rainfall simulation study, we evaluated the effects of surface co-applied P-sources and an Al-WTR on runoff and leacheate bioavailable P (BAP) losses from a Florida sand. Four P-sources, namely poultry manure, Boca Raton biosolids (high water-soluble P), Pompano biosolids (moderate water-soluble P), and triple super phosphate (TSP) were surface applied at 56 and 224 kg P ha(-1) (by weight) to represent low and high soil P loads typical of P- and N-based amendments rates. The treatments further received surface applied WTR at 0 or 10 g WTR kg(-1) soil. BAP loss masses were greater in leachate (16.4-536 mg) than in runoff (0.91-46 mg), but were reduced in runoff and leachate by surface applied WTR. Masses of total BAP lost in the presence of surface applied WTR were less than approximately 75% of BAP losses in the absence of WTR. Total BAP losses from each of the organic sources applied at N-based rates were not greater than P loss from TSP applied at a P-based rate. The BAP loss at the N-based rate of moderate water-soluble P-source (Pompano biosolids) was not greater than BAP losses at the P-based rates of other organic sources tested. The hazards of excess P from applying organic P-sources at N-based rates are not greater than observed at P-based rates of mineral fertilizer. Results suggest that management of the environmental P hazards associated with N-based rates of organic materials in Florida sands is possible by either applying P-sources with WTR or using a moderate water-soluble P-source.</str>

Paraffin-embedded tumour biopsy specimens from the primary tumours were available for flow cytometry (FCM) in 273 cases. Intra-tumour heterogeneity in DNA index (DI) was found in 4% of the tumours (54 cases were analysed). S-phase fraction (SPF) and DNA ploidy were significantly interrelated. Aneuploidy and high SPF were significantly related to both a high T category and high Gleason score.

In the entire cohort, the T category (P &lt; 0.001), M category (P &lt; 0.001), Gleason score (P &lt; 0.001), DNA ploidy (P &lt; 0.001) and SPF (P &lt; 0.001) were significant prognostic factors. In Cox's analysis, the M category (P &lt; 0.001), Gleason score (P &lt; 0.001), T category (P = 0.003), age (P = 0.001) and SPF (P = 0.087) were independently related to prognosis. In the T1-2M0 tumours, Gleason score (P &lt; 0.001), T category (P = 0.022) and SPF (P = 0.058) were independent predictors. A novel classification system in which the DNA ploidy or SPF and the Gleason score were combined was found to be of significant prognostic value in all M0 tumours (P &lt; 0.001). The results suggest that FCM can be used as an adjunct to conventional histological assessments for determination of the correct prognostic category in prostatic adenocarcinoma.</str>

      <str>Crop residues are a vital organic resource and their extensive use in soil management for sustainable agriculture is widely advocated. The effects of soybean residue (SR) and wheat residue (WR) applied alone or in combination with fertilizer P (FP) on dynamics of labile P, distribution of P fractions and P sorption in a Vertisol (Typic Haplustert) were assessed in a 16 week long incubation study. The amount of P added through crop residues, FP or their combination was kept constant at 10 mg P kg(-1) soil. Addition of SR or WR resulted in net increase of labile inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) P, and microbial P throughout the incubation period, except that the WR decreased labile Pi during the first two weeks due to Pi immobilization. Integration of FP with SR had no added benefit compared to SR alone, while use of FP + WR proved better in ensuring short-term P availability by offsetting initial P immobilization associated with WR alone. Sequential fractionation of soil P at the end of 16 weeks showed that addition of SR and WR alone or in combination with FP favoured a build-up in labile Pi and Po (NaHCO3-Pi and Po), and moderately labile Po (NaOH-Po) fractions at the expense of recalcitrant P (HCl-P). The P sorption capacity of soil and P required to maintain optimum solution P concentration of 0.2 mg P 1(-1) also decreased with addition of these crop residues. The implication of the results of this study is that soybean and wheat residues can potentially improve soil P fertility by increasing labile Pi and Po, and moderately labile Po fractions, decreasing P sorption and concomitantly causing dissolution of recalcitrant P in soil.</str>

      <str>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is rarely seen in patients younger than 50 years, but rapidly increases with advancing age. Data on MDS biology in young patients are yet scarce but more than necessary. The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion of MDS patients &lt;50 years of age and to compare the clinicopathological data between younger and older patients.</str>
      <str>Of our total MDS cases comprising 587 adult patients we studied 83 adults (14.14%) aged &lt; 50 years with primary MDS.</str>
      <str>MDS patients were classified in those aged &lt; 50 years and those aged ≥ 50 years. Younger MDS patients were characterized by female preponderance (p&lt;0.001), better performance status (p=0.0035), less severe anaemia (p=0.008), better preserved kidney function (p=0.037), less often blast infiltration in bone marrow (p=0.015), more cases of RA (p&lt;0.001) and RCUD (p=0.0066), lower MD Anderson score (p&lt;0.001), longer overall survival (OS) (p&lt;0.001), but similar progression rate (p=0.591). Median OS of young MDS patients was 39.7 months and 19 months of patients &gt;50 years (p&lt;0.001). In this group, 24 patients (28.92%) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) vs 111 (22.02%) patients&gt;50 years (p=0.402). Multivariate analysis identified platelet count (p=0.008) and percent of blasts in bone marrow (p=0.024) to be predictive for shorter OS in patients &lt; 50 years of age; the same factors (p&lt;0.001) together with IPSS-R cytogenetic risk group (p&lt;0.001) were identified in patients &gt;50 years of age. Platelet count (p=0.003) and percent of blasts in bone marrow (p=0.001) were predictive for higher risk of transformation to AML in patients &lt;50 years, and bone marrow infiltration (p=0.022) and IPSS-R cytogenetic risk group (p=0.027) for patients &gt;50 years of age.</str>
      <str>Presenting features in young MDS patients may identify subjects at higher risk for unfavorable outcome.</str>

      <str>P-flavin-bound luciferase, P-flavin-free luciferase, and P-flavin-bound beta-subunit of luciferase were prepared from Photobacterium phosphoreum using hydrophobic interaction chromatography after conventional purification using DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel-filtration. The P-flavin-bound luciferase preparation contained about 20% P-flavin-free luciferase not removable by the present procedure. Since the specific activity of the P-flavin-bound luciferase preparation was about 20% of that of the P-flavin-free luciferase, it was concluded that the P-flavin-bound luciferase is an enzyme-product complex and has no more luciferase activity. Unlike the absorption spectrum of FP390 or other flavoproteins, that of P-flavin-bound luciferase preparation has a high absorption peak around 370 nm and resembles the spectrum synthesized by superposing the P-flavin-free luciferase spectrum on the P-flavin-bound beta-subunit spectrum: the P-flavin-bound beta-subunit spectrum is similar to that of FP390, while that of P-flavin-free luciferase has an absorption peak around 370 nm but practically no peak around 450 nm. In addition, P-flavin-free luciferase exhibits a weak but distinct NADH-FMN oxidoreductase activity. These results suggest that a prosthetic group, which absorbs around 370 nm, binds to the luciferase and that this compound is required to yield P-flavin; and they support the hypothesis that the physiological function of bacterial luciferase is to produce P-flavin. Furthermore, the presence of P-flavin-bound beta-subunit of the luciferase in the cell extract supports the hypothesis that physiological function of the lux operon is the biosynthesis of FP390 including its prosthetic group.</str>

      <str>With two rice genotypes (cv. Zhongbu 51 and Azucena) differing in their root-secreted acid phosphatase activity (APA) under low P condition as test materials, an agar culture experiment was conducted to investigate their P utilization from myo-inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) under conditions of sterilization and inoculating with soil microorganisms. Under sterilization, the shoot dry mass, P absorption and P concentration of test genotypes supplied with hexaphosphate (IHP) as the P source were significantly higher than those with no P supply, but significantly lower than those supplied with inorganic P, indicating that rice plants could partly acquire P from IHP under sterilized condition. The root-secreted APA of the two genotypes was significantly higher under low P than under sufficient P supply, and the higher APA of Zhongbu 51 under low P could be one of the mechanisms of higher P utilization capability of Zhongbu 51 than Azucena under deficient P supply. When supplied with high level IHP (0.96 mmol P x L(-1)), the shoot dry mass, P absorption and P concentration of both Zhongbu 51 and Azucena were higher than those when supplied with low level IHP (0.16 mmol P x L(-1)), indicating that substrate availability could be one of the limiting factors to the utilization of phytate by rice. Inoculation with soil microorganisms had no significant effects on the shoot dry mass, P absorption and P concentration of rice plants, regardless of IHP level and rice genotypes, implying that the utilization of IHP by rice could not be improved via inoculation with soil microorganisms.</str>

      <str>The metabolism of Mg was studied in young dairy calves fed two levels of added Al (0 and .20% Al) and two levels of added P (0 and .22% P) for 7 wk. The four treatments were 1) normal P-low Al, 2) low P-low Al, 3) normal P-high Al and 4) low P-high Al. The basal diet (low P-low Al) contained, by analysis, .132% P, .021% Al and .17% Mg. Added Al did not affect (P greater than .10) serum Mg. An Al x P interaction on bone Mg was detected (P less than .01). Magnesium was reduced in tibia shaft (.34 vs .44%) and in tibia joint (.43 vs .53%) in calves fed high Al in the presence of normal dietary P, but Mg was not reduced in the calves fed low-P diets. Apparent absorption of Mg was reduced by approximately five-fold (.18 g/d vs -.84 g/d, P less than .01); urinary Mg excretion was reduced 31% (1.12 g/d vs .77 g/d, P less than .01); and Mg retention declined 41% (-95 g/d vs -1.61 g/d, P less than .01) in calves fed added A1. Compared with calves fed low-P diets, calves fed normal levels of P had a higher Mg concentration in tibia shaft (P less than .01) and tibia joint (P less than .05). The data indicate that supplemental Al may adversely affect Mg metabolism in calves.</str>

      <str>In all animals a decline in the vitamin B12 concentration (p ≤ 0.05) at 4 weeks p. p. was observed. Animals of both groups (healthy/morbid) had higher values for the erythrocyte count, haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration 2-6 days p. p. when compared to 4 weeks p. p. In all cows, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity was closely correlated to the vitamin B12 concentration (p ≤ 0.01). Furthermore, all animals displayed elevated concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids and bilirubin (p ≤ 0.05) at 2-6 days p. p. as a consequence of partus-dependent increased lipolysis. There was a smaller decrease in the vitamin B12 concentration in the morbid cows compared to the healthy cows (p   ≤   0.05).</str>
      <str>The vitamin B12 concentration is significantly dynamic during lactation and displays a close relationship with the GGT activity and the parameters of energy metabolism. Vitamin B12 may act as an indicator for increased lipolysis and cholestasis. Higher vitamin B12 concentrations may indicate clinical problems. A relationship with haematopoiesis is recognizable from the red cell readings. Decreasing red cell readings associated with reduced performance could be related to a low vitamin B12 concentration. The close correlations of vitamin B12 with GGT activity and bilirubin concentration may indicate cholestatic metabolic stress in dairy cows at blood serum concentrations ≥ 227 ng/l (3rd quartile 2-6 days p. p. healthy group). Morbid cows can already be identified at the subclinical stage.</str>

      <str>To characterize the relationship between P element activities and their structures, we cloned P elements from genomic libraries of three isogenic P and Q strains derived from natural populations in Japan. These P elements were mapped with BamHI, AvaII and PstI and were classified by their size. The majority of P elements cloned were classified as either complete or relatively small P elements rather than medium size. The numbers of full length (2.9 kb) P elements per haploid genome of NP280 (P), AK194 (weak P) and WY113 (Q) were at least four, five and one, respectively. However, the 2.9 kb P element of WY113 was thought to be defective since this strain has no transposase activity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the ORF 3-deleted P element is essential for P cytotype determination in WY113. A similar P element also exists in NP280, and this may have an important role for P cytotype determination in this strain. Two and one copies of the KP element, a deletion derivative of the P element, were found in NP280 and AK194, respectively. One of four complete P elements in NP280 was fully sequenced, and the base sequence was completely identical to that of p pi 25.1 originally derived from the U.S.A. This result is consistent with the notion that these P elements have a relatively recent origin in Drosophila melanogaster.</str>

      <str>BACKGROUND To study the relationship between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) risk factors in a Chinese population. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data analyzed in this study were from the Chinese Hyperuricemia and Gout Database. Indicators of serum uric acid (SUA) level, height, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), smoking status, alcohol consumption, blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. T test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation, multivariate linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression were used. RESULTS Compared with normouricemic men, hyperuricemic men had greater height (P&lt;0.01), weight (P&lt;0.001), body mass index (BMI) (P&lt;0.001), SBP (P&lt;0.01), DBP (P&lt;0.001), cholesterol (P&lt;0.01), and triglyceride (P&lt;0.001). Compared with normouricemic women, hyperuricemic women were older (P&lt;0.01) and had greater weight (P&lt;0.05), BMI (P&lt;0.01), SBP (P&lt;0.01), DBP (P&lt;0.05), glucose (P&lt;0.05), and triglyceride (P&lt;0.001). In men, an increase of 1 mg/dL in SUA was associated with a 0.279 kg/m2 increase in BMI (P&lt;0.001), a 2.438 mg/dL increase in cholesterol (P&lt;0.05), a 10.358 mg/dL increase in triglyceride (P&lt;0.001), and a 3.1 mg/dL decrease in glucose (P&lt;0.01). In women, an increase of 1 mg/dL SUA was associated with a 0.168 kg/m2 increase in BMI (P&lt;0.01) and a 3.708 mg/dL increase in triglyceride (P&lt;0.01). After adjustment, SUA was strongly associated with obesity and hyperlipidemia in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS Elevated serum uric acid concentration was strongly associated with obesity and hyperlipidemia in both men and women. These results indicated that, among hyperuricemia patients, we should pay more attention to the possibility of cardiovascular complications. These results might provide a novel target or a possible new treatment for cardiovascular diseases by lowering the level of serum uric acid. </str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) surplus on dairy farms, especially confined operations, contributes to P buildup in soils with increased potential for P loss to waters. One approach to reduce P surplus and improve water quality is to optimize P feeding and improve P balance on farms. Here we report how varying P concentrations in lactating cow diets affects the amount as well as the chemical forms and fraction distribution of P in fecal excretion, and the environmental implications of this effect. Analysis of fecal samples collected from three independent feeding trials indicates that increasing dietary P levels through the use of P minerals not only led to a higher concentration of acid digest total phosphorus (TP) in feces, but more importantly increased the amount and proportion of P that is water soluble and thus most susceptible to loss in the environment. For instance, with diets containing 3.4, 5.1, or 6.7 g P kg(-1) feed dry matter (DM), the water-soluble fraction of fecal P was 2.91, 7.13, and 10.46 g kg(-1) fecal DM, respectively, accounting for 56, 77, and 83% of acid digest TP. The other fecal P fractions (those soluble in dilute alkaline and acid extractants) remained small and were unaffected by dietary P concentration. Excess P in the P supplemented diets was excreted in feces as water-soluble forms. A simple measure of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in a single water extract is highly responsive to changes in diet P concentrations and hence can be indicative of dietary P status. A fecal P indicator concept is proposed and discussed.</str>

The bioconcentration factor reached a maximum of 19 x 10(3) in oysters, and 1657 in Humbug fish after 24 hours. The sediment concentration reached 117 ng g(-1) after 168 hours from start of application. A peak bioconcentration factor of 111 x 10(3) was calculated after 120 hours when 0.24 mg kg(-1) of 14C-p,p'-DDT was maintained through dosing every 24 hours with 0.002 mg kg(-1) of a mixture of labelled and non-labelled pesticide. The rate of depuration of accumulated 14C-p,p'-DDT sediment residues was up to 78.3% after 24 hours while oysters lost only 14.0% during the same period. The loss in Humbug fish was only 22.2% in three days. Volatilisation and sorption losses from seawater alone (without sediment/biota) were found to be very high in the range of 73.8 - 91.5% over 24 h for p,p'-DDT in aerated and nonaerated ecosystem. Gas chromatograph and TLC analysis of water, sediment and oyster samples revealed presence of p,p'-DDT and substantial amounts of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD three days after pesticide dosage.</str>

      <str>We have measured the concentrations of substance P, somatostatin, homovanillic acid (HVA), vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of six patients suffering from narcolepsy and 12 age- and gender-matched controls using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Substance P and somatostatin were significantly decreased in our patients compared to controls (36.9 +/- 9.1 fmol/ml versus 52.5 +/- 9.9 fmol/ml, P &lt; 0.05 and 30.3 +/- 7.8 fmol/ml versus 43.9 +/- 9.8 fmol/ml, P &lt; 0.05, respectively). 5-HIAA (P &lt; 0.05) and VMA (P &lt; 0.05) were also significantly decreased. HVA was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01). The CSF concentrations of substance P and somatostatin correlated with the clinical parameters duration of disease (r = -0.68, P &lt; 0.05 and r = -0.72, P &lt; 0.05, respectively) and severity of cataplectic symptoms (r = -0.71, P &lt; 0.05 and r = -0.78, P &lt; 0.01). In addition, substance P correlated with the intensity of sleepiness and the frequency of day-sleep attacks (r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.05 and r = -0.68, P &lt; 0.05, respectively). Substance P affects the amount of dopamine release in the nigra-striatal region, and decreased amounts could contribute to the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. Reduced levels of substance P, which affects serotonin release, may be responsible for diminished release of serotonin which in turn could affect sleep cycles. Because somatostatin affects motor behavior through dopaminergic mechanisms and since the levels of somatostatin correlate with the intensity of cataplectic symptoms, we speculate that an interaction between somatostatin and dopaminergic neurons plays a role in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy.</str>

      <str>An experiment was conducted to study the effect of microbial phytase (Natuphos 500) supplementation in chicks (0 to 6 wk of age) fed different levels of nonphytate phosphorus (nPP) on performance, mineral retention, bone and plasma minerals and serum enzyme activities. Data were analyzed as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two levels of nPP for age periods of 1-d-old to 3 wk (0.35 and 0.22%) and 3 to 6 wk (0.27 and 0.14%) and two levels of phytase (0 and 500 U/kg) in each period. A positive control, adequate in nPP and Ca without phytase, was used. The low-nPP diets caused a negative effect on the performance (P &lt; 0.05) compared to the normalnPP diet. Phytase had a favorable effect on weight gain at 3 wk (P &lt; 0.004) and 6 wk (P &lt; 0.0475) of age and on feed consumption only at 3 wk (P &lt; 0.0106). Feed efficiency was not affected at any stage by addition of phytase. Performances of chicks fed with 0.35 and 0.27% nPP and phytase were comparable to those obtained with the normal-nPP diets. Decreasing nPP content in the diet increased (P &lt; 0.0001) P retention at 3 and 6 wk of age, increased Mg retention at 6 wk, and decreased (P &lt; 0.0001) Ca and Zn retentions at 3 and 6 wk, respectively. Phytase supplementation increased (P &lt; 0.0001) Ca, P, Mg, and Zn retention at 3 and 6 wk of age. Likewise, the decrease in nPP content in the diet caused a significant reduction of tibia ash (P &lt; 0.0023) and Mg content (P &lt; 0.0001) in tibia ash and reduced liver (P &lt; 0.0240), spleen (P &lt; 0.0176), and tibia (P &lt; 0.0001) weights. Similarly, Ca (P &lt; 0.0369) and Zn (P &lt; 0.0181) contents in tibia ash were increased in response to decreasing nPP levels in the diet. Phytase supplementation increased tibia weight (P &lt; 0.0019), tibia ash (P &lt; 0.0021), and Mg (P &lt; 0.0339) and Zn (P &lt; 0.0353) concentrations and reduced (P &lt; 0.0161) the relative liver weight. By decreasing nPP levels in the diet, plasma Ca (P &lt; 0.0001), Mg (P &lt; 0.0001) and Zn (P &lt; 0.0048) concentrations, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (P &lt; 0.0299) increased, and plasma P content (P &lt; 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (P &lt; 0.0001), and total protein (TP) content (P &lt; 0.0050) were reduced. Phytase supplementation increased plasma P level (P &lt; 0.0001) and serum AST activity (P &lt; 0.0049), reduced plasma Ca (P &lt; 0.0001) and Mg (P &lt; 0.0050) contents, and reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P &lt; 0.0048), ALP (P &lt; 0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P &lt; 0.0192) activities. Plasma Zn was not affected by phytase supplementation. These results demonstrated that microbial phytase supplementation to low-P diets improved performance; P, Ca, Mg, and Zn use; and tibia weight and relative liver weight in broiler chickens. Likewise, serum AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH activities, as well as TP concentration, were also affected by phytase supplementation.</str>

      <str>After open-chest cardiac surgery, ventricular function remains depressed (myocardial stunning). Catecholamines (epinephrine) improve ventricular function by increasing the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. In parallel, the oxygen consumption is increased, so that the hitherto intact myocardium can be jeopardized. In the very insufficient ventricle, epinephrine can even become ineffective. Since Ca(2+) sensitizers provide another therapeutic avenue, the effects of epinephrine and levosimendan on postischemic hemodynamics were investigated.</str>
      <str>After hemodynamic steady state, isolated, blood (erythrocyte-enriched Krebs-Henseleit solution)-perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 25 min normothermic, no-flow ischemia and 20 min reperfusion. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular pressure (LVP), coronary blood flow (CBF), and arterio-venous oxygen difference (AVDO(2)) were recorded during reperfusion and after administration of either epinephrine (n=16; 0.03 micromol), or levosimendan (n=11; 0.75 micromol) or epinephrine plus levosimendan (n=5).</str>
      <str>Epinephrine increased HR (19%, p=0.01) and improved hemodynamics in terms of CO (62%, p=0.0006), stroke volume SV (46%, p=0.02), stroke work W (158%, p=0.01), LVP(max) (58%, p=0.0001), maximal pressure increase dP/dt(max)(140%, p=0.0004), minimal pressure increase dP/dt(min) (104%, p=0.0002), LVP(ed) (-26%, p=0.02), and increased coronary resistance CR (31%, p=0.05). Epinephrine impaired hemodynamics in terms of AVDO(2) (+63%, p=0.003), myocardial oxygen consumption MVO(2) (+67%, p=0.0003) and MVO(2)/beat (+36%, p=0.01). External efficiency eta was increased by 92% (p=0.02). Levosimendan in postischemic hearts increased HR (32%, p=0.009) and improved hemodynamics in terms of CO (85%, p=0.01), SV (44%, p=0.03), W (115%, p=0.04), LVP(max) (95%, p=0.04), dP/dt(max) (133%, p=0.009), dP/dt(min) (121%, p=0.007), LVP(ed) (-63%, p=0.0006), and CR (-17%; n.s., p=0.1). It altered hemodynamics in terms of AVDO(2) (+7.0%; n.s., p=0.3) and MVO(2) (+32%, p=0.007) and MVO(2)/beat (+2.3%; n.s., p=0.4). External efficiency was increased by 307% (p=0.04). In five additional extremely dysfunctional rabbit hearts, epinephrine was ineffective. Additional levosimendan increased hemodynamics in terms of HR (56%; n.s., p=0.1), CO (159%, p=0.04), SV (89%, p=0.03), W (588%, p=0.02), LVP(max) (168%, p=0.03), dP/dt(max) (102%, p=0.005), dP/dt(min) (78%, p=0.006), LVP(ed) (-98%, p=0.0006), and CR (-50%, p=0.02). It altered hemodynamics in terms of AVDO(2) (-11%; n.s., p=0.05), MVO(2) (+131%, p=0.04) and MVO(2)/beat (+171%, p=0.03). External efficiency was increased by 212% (p=0.04).</str>
      <str>In contrast to epinephrine, levosimendan improves ventricular function without increasing oxygen demand, thereby considerably improving external efficiency. Even during epinephrine resistance in extremely dysfunctional hearts, levosimendan successfully improves ventricular function.</str>

      <str>In this study, the effect of polymorphisms in the leptin gene on the hematological variables in periparturient dairy cows was investigated. The hematological profile of 67 Holstein cows was assessed for 6 wk around calving. The DNA of the cows was genotyped at 6 polymorphic loci within the leptin gene, and 7 haplotypes were reconstructed. Significant haplotype substitution effects were found, for haplotype 1, on total white blood cell count for 2 wk around calving (+0.70 10(3)/μL, P = 0.05; +1.38 10(3)/μL, P = 0.0001); on neutrophil cell count in the first week after calving (+0.94 10(3)/μL, P = 0.001); on lymphocyte count during the 3 wk before and the first week after calving (+0.32 10(3)/μL, P = 0.05; +0.27 10(3)/μL, P = 0.03; +0.26 10(3)/μL, P = 0.04; +0.34 10(3)/μL, P = 0.01); on red blood cell count during the last week before calving and wk 1 and 2 after calving (+0.21 10(6)/μL, P = 0.02; +0.23 10(6)/μL, P = 0.01; +0.20 10(6)/μL, P = 0.03); on mean corpuscular volume (-1.35 fL, P = 0.01; -1.29 fL, P = 0.002; -1.18 fL, P = 0.004; -1.09 fL, P = 0.008; -1.23 fL, P = 0.003; -1.31 fL, P = 0.003); and on mean corpuscular hemoglobin (-0.37 pg, P = 0.05; -0.38 pg, P = 0.02; -0.39 pg, P = 0.01; -0.34 pg, P = 0.03; -0.40 pg, P = 0.01; -0.40 pg, P = 0.01) during all 6 wk analyzed. Significant haplotype substitution effects, but opposite those of haplotype-1, were found for haplotype-2 on white blood cell count (-1.10 10(3)/μL, P = 0.01; -1.30 10(3)/μL, P = 0.002; -1.09 10(3)/μL, P = 0.01) and neutrophil count (-0.82 10(3)/μL, P = 0.02; -0.95 10(3)/μL, P = 0.005; -0.92 10(3)/μL, P = 0.01). Haplotype-3 influenced red blood cell count (-0.23 10(6)/μL, P = 0.03; -0.28 10(6)/μL, P = 0.01; -0.34 10(6)/μL, P = 0.002) during the last 2 wk before and the first week after calving, and also, with effects evident only in wk 3 and 2 before calving, mean corpuscular volume (+1.38 fL, P = 0.03; +0.97 fL, P = 0.05; +1.08 fL, P = 0.05), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (+0.58 pg, P = 0.02; +0.38 pg, P = 0.04; 0.51 pg, P = 0.01), and red blood cell distribution width (-0.56% P = 0.02; -0.47%, P = 0.05). The current study provided evidence that several polymorphisms in the leptin gene play a role in the variability of hematological variables during the peripartum period, and might be used as genetic markers for improving the immunological conditions of dairy cows in critical productive periods.</str>

      <str>Substance P has been localized to the neuropil of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in light and electron microscopic studies. Two recent reports have suggested that the majority of substance P in the rat intermediolateral cell column was contained in synaptic terminals of bulbospinal axons. However, previous investigations in our laboratory indicated the presence of major substance P spinal-sympathetic preganglionic neuron circuitry in pigeon. The present study used radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry to examine substance P levels in rat intermediolateral cell column following various spinal lesions in order to assess the relative contributions of bulbospinal and intraspinal substance P neurons to the substance P content of the intermediolateral cell column. The results from these experiments support the existence of both bulbospinal and intraspinal substance P-containing projections to the rat intermediolateral cell column. In addition, characterization of spinal cord substance P-like immunoreactivity by combined high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, revealed that substance P in rat intermediolateral cell column was indistinguishable from synthetic substance P. Following transection of thoracic spinal cord, substance P-immunoreactive staining was still evident in the intermediolateral cell column caudal to the lesion. These substance P-positive fibers were studded with bouton-like swellings and appeared normal. Following high cervical hemisection, depletion of substance P (radioimmunoassay measurements) was bilateral and equal in the intermediolateral cell column: 25% depletion was observed after 7 days and 35% depletion after 14 days. However, rats which were hemisected at low cervical and/or mid-thoracic levels contained normal or elevated amounts of substance P in the intermediolateral cell column. Since substance P remains in the intermediolateral cell column following total transection, substance P spinal-sympathetic preganglionic neuron circuitry must exist. Additionally, depletion of substance P following high cervical hemisection suggests the existence of a substance P-containing, bilateral bulbospinal pathway to the intermediolateral cell column. The observation that substance P levels were normal or elevated following low cervical lesions raises the possibility that intraspinal substance P neurons can compensate for loss of substance P in the spinal cord. Sprouting or altered substance P metabolism and/or release by intraspinal substance P neurons could be responsible, suggesting an important homeostatic mechanism for maintaining substance P content within the intermediolateral cell column.</str>

      <str>In opossum kidney (OK) cells as well as in kidney proximal tubules, P(i) depletion increases apical (A) and basolateral (B) Na(+)-dependent P(i) cell influxes. In OK cells' monolayers in contrast to proximal tubules, there is no increase in transepithelial P(i) transport. This limitation may be due to altered cell-matrix interactions. A and B cell (32)P(i) uptakes and transepithelial (32)P(i) and [(14)C]mannitol fluxes were measured in OK cells grown on uncoated or on Matrigel-coated filter inserts. Cells were exposed overnight to solution of either low (0.25 mM) or high (2.5 mM) P(i). When grown on Matrigel, immunofluorescence of apical NaPi4 (an isoform of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter) transporters increased and A and B (32)P(i) uptakes into P(i) depleted cells were five and threefold higher than in P(i) replete cells (P &lt; 0.001). P(i) deprivation resulted in larger increase in A to B (4.6x, P &lt; 0.001) than in B to A (3.5x, P &lt; 0.001) P(i) flux and net P(i) transport from A to B increased 10-fold (P &lt; 0.001). With P(i) depletion increases in B to A (3.4x) and A to B (3.3x) paracellular [(14)C]mannitol fluxes were similar, and its net flux was opposite to that of P(i). In cells grown on uncoated filters, transepithelial and paracellular unidirectional and net P(i) fluxes decreased or did not change with P(i) depletion, despite twofold increases in apical and basolateral P(i) cell influxes. In summary, Matrigel-OK cell interactions, particularly in P(i)-depleted cells, led to enhanced expression of apical NaPi4 transporters resulting in higher P(i) transport rates across cell boundaries; apical P(i) readily entered the transcellular transport pool and paracellular fluxes were smaller fractions of transepithelial P(i) fluxes. These Matrigel-induced changes led to an increase in net transepithelial apical to basolateral P(i) transport.</str>

In the present study, an array of 12 different monoclonal antibodies produced against cytochrome P-450b has been used to distinguish among these closely related phenobarbital-inducible rat hepatic cytochromes P-450. In immunoblots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, 10 monoclonal antibodies bind to cytochromes P-450b, P-450e, and P-450bH; one monoclonal antibody (B50) recognizes cytochromes P-450b and P-450bH but not cytochrome P-450e; and one monoclonal antibody (B51) is specific for cytochrome P-450b. In addition, one monoclonal antibody (BEF29) reacts strongly with cytochrome P-450f, and another antibody (BEA33) reacts weakly with cytochrome P-450a. No cross-reactions with cytochromes P-450c, P-450d, and P-450g-P-450j were detected with any of the monoclonal antibodies in these assays. Six spatially distinct epitopes on cytochrome P-450b were identified, and differences in antibody reactivity provided evidence for three additional overlapping epitopes. Several monoclonal antibodies are potent inhibitors of testosterone and benzphetamine metabolism supported by cytochrome P-450b in a reconstituted system. B50 and BE52 do not inhibit metabolism of the two substrates by microsomes from untreated rats, but inhibit benzphetamine N-demethylation and testosterone metabolism to 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxytestosterone as well as androstenedione formation 67-94% by microsomes from phenobarbital-treated rats. No other pathways of testosterone metabolism are inhibited by these monoclonal antibodies. The differential inhibition of microsomal metabolism of benzphetamine and testosterone by these monoclonal antibodies is a reflection of the content and inducibility of cytochromes P-450b and P-450e as well as other cytochrome P-450 isozymes.</str>

      <str>The study was aimed at exploring the mechanism of tenderization by establishing a correlation between caspase-3 activity and shear force, verifying the activation occurring by analyzing active caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragments, and understanding the pathways involved in activation of caspase-3 by evaluating its correlation with caspase-8 and -9 activities in LM, semitendinosus (STN), and psoas minor (PM) muscles. The results indicated that shear force decreased at 48 h in PM (P &lt; 0.01), LM (P &lt; 0.01), and STN (P &lt; 0.05). We detected p22, p23, p20, and p18 caspase fragments as well as distinctive PARP fragments of 24 kDa by caspase-3 and 36 kDa by µ-calpain. Caspase-3 activity correlated with shear force negatively at 24 and 48 h in STN (P &lt; 0.01 at 24 h; P &lt; 0.01 at 48 h), PM (P &lt; 0.001 at 24 h; P &lt; 0.01 at 48 h), and LM muscles (P &lt; 0.05 at 24 h; P &lt; 0.01 at 48 h). The greatest activities of caspase-8 (P &lt; 0.001 in PM and STN; P &lt; 0.01 in LM) and caspase-9 (P &lt; 0.001 in muscles) appeared at 4 h whereas that of caspase-3 was at 24 h (P &lt; 0.001 in muscles). Caspase-9 activity correlated positively with caspase-3 at 4, 24, and 48 h in STN (P &lt; 0.01 at 4 h; P &lt; 0.05 at 24 h; P &lt; 0.001 at 48 h) and at 4 and 96 h in PM (P &lt; 0.001 at 4 h; P &lt; 0.05 at 96 h) and LM muscles (P &lt; 0.001 at 4 h; P &lt; 0.001 at 96 h). The caspase-8 activity correlated with caspase-3 at 4, 48, and 96 h in STN (P &lt; 0.05 at 4 h; P &lt; 0.001 at 48 h; P &lt; 0.05 at 96 h), at 4 and 24 h in PM (P &lt; 0.001 at 4 h; P &lt; 0.05 at 24 h), and at 4 and 96 h in LM (P &lt; 0.001 at 4 h; P &lt; 0.01 at 96 h). We concluded that caspase-3 was associated with the decline of shear force; the activation of caspase-3 was mediated by caspases -8 and -9 in muscles. However, more detailed studies are needed to define the precise mechanism for the cleavage of pro-caspases -8 and -9 during conditioning.</str>

      <str>Although the expression pattern of phosphorylated (p)-mTOR pathway components has attracted scientific interest in several neoplasms, to our knowledge, there is no published information regarding its significance in mycosis fungoides (MF).</str>

      <str>In all, 54 skin biopsy specimens (21 tumors, 30 plaques, and 3 folliculotropic MF) from 50 patients with MF were analyzed immunohistochemically for p-mTOR, its upstream p-AKT, its downstream effectors p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1, and for p-ERK1/2, NOTCH1, and p-STAT3.</str>
      <str>p-mTOR was coexpressed with p-p70S6K in 67.3% of lesions, but coexpression with other molecules was less common. p-p70S6K and marginally NOTCH1 displayed higher H-scores in tumors than in plaques. Significant correlations were recorded between p-ERK and p-4E-BP1, as well as between NOTCH1 and p-p70S6K or p-4E-BP1. NOTCH1, p-4E-BP1, and p-p70S6K expression were associated with advanced stage. In survival analysis simultaneous overexpression of p-AKT and p-p70S6K, along with p-4E-BP1 positivity, adversely affected cancer-specific, disease-free, and progression-free survival in advanced-stage cases.</str>

      <str>A previous report from this laboratory showed that two DDT isomers, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD, increased the frequency of spontaneous oscillatory contractions to a similar extent in isolated rat uterine segments. Because regulation of intracellular calcium is fundamental for the development of oscillatory contractions, the present study examined the effects of p,p'-DDD on intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual rat myometrial smooth muscle cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2. In the presence of extracellular calcium, 50 and 100 microM p,p'-DDD significantly increased peak [Ca2+]i 586 and 921%, respectively, over basal [Ca2+]i. No significant effect was observed with 10 microM p,p'-DDD. In the absence of extracellular calcium, the response to 100 microM p,p'-DDD was significantly attenuated, with cells averaging a 108% increase in peak [Ca2+]i over basal levels, presumably through Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Nifedipine and cadmium chloride, blockers of voltage-dependent calcium channels, inhibited 100 microM p,p'-DDD-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i such that peak [Ca2+]i was increased 250% and 259%, respectively. Because of the prominent inhibition observed with the voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers, the effect of p,p'-DDD on membrane depolarization was examined using a cationic fluorescent indicator of membrane potential, [diS-C2(5)]. A concentration of 50 microM p,p'-DDD depolarized the cells by 35% of maximum during treatment with p,p'-DDD. The data demonstrate that p,p'-DDD increased [Ca2+]i in rat myometrial smooth muscle cells in a concentration-related manner, and that this increase was largely dependent on influx of extracellular calcium through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent calcium channels. The data further show that p,p'-DDD depolarized the plasma membrane, providing a possible mechanism for activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Additionally, another calcium source, perhaps an intracellular pool, contributes significantly less to the rise of [Ca2+]i. Whether p,p'-DDD initiates the calcium response by direct actions on the plasma membrane or by other means remains to be determined.</str>

      <str>A trial was conducted to evaluate the dose response of a novel microbial 6-phytase expressed in Aspergillus oryzae (Ronozyme HiPhos; DSM Nutritional Products, Basel, Switzerland) in pigs. Forty-eight individually housed pigs (Landrace × Pietrain; 52 kg BW; 24 males and 24 females) were distributed among 6 experimental treatments consisting of a low-P diet (3.5 g P/kg; 1.1 g digestible P/kg), which was supplemented with 500, 1000, 2000, or 4000 units of phytase activity/kg, and a standard-P diet (4.5 g P/kg; 1.8 g digestible P/kg) that was supplemented with CaHPO(4). After 17 d, fresh feces were sampled from all pigs and the apparent total tract digestibility of DM, OM, ash, P, and Ca was measured using TiO(2) as indigestible marker. Blood samples were also obtained from each pig and serum was analyzed for P and Ca concentrations. The nonsupplemented low-P diet increased Ca and reduced P blood serum concentrations (P &lt; 0.05) relative to the standard-P diet (10.8 vs. 10.2 and 6.7 vs. 7.7 mg/dL, respectively). Phytase supplementation of the low-P diet reduced Ca (from 10.8 to 9.9 mg/dL; linear, P &lt; 0.001) and increased P concentrations (from 6.7 to 8.0 mg/dL; linear and quadratic, P &lt; 0.001) in serum and reduced P concentration in feces (from 13.7 to 7.6 g/kg DM; linear and quadratic, P &lt; 0.001). Phytase improved the total tract digestibility of P (from 29.0 to 62.3%; linear and quadratic, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05), Ca (from 54.0 to 75.7%; quadratic, P &lt; 0.01), and ash (from 46.2 to 57.7%; quadratic, P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, the microbial 6-phytase tested improves the apparent total tract digestibility of P in growing pigs and reduces P excretion in feces in a dose-dependent manner.</str>

      <str>A simple and practical radioimmunoassy (RIA) for pregnanediol without any pretreatment of urine specimens such as hydrolysis and/or extraction was developed. Antisera were produced by immunizing rabbits with pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (P-diol-3-G)-BSA conjugates and P-diol-3-hemisuccinate-BSA conjugates. The specificities of the antisera were examined by their cross-reactivities with related steroids. Antiserum to P-diol-3-G-BSA was significantly cross-reacted with 20 alpha-OH-P(201%), P-diol(100%), P -diol-3-G (77.3%, where 119% as free P-diol), to a lesser extent with 20 beta-OH-P(17.8%), and did not react with other steroids. Antiserum to P-diol-3-hemisuccinate-BSA, on the other hand, was capable of reacting with P-diol(100%), P-diol-3-G(46.9%), 20 alpha-OH-P(75.2%) and 20beta-OH-P (8.97%), respectively. Antiserum generated against P-diol-3-G-BSA was almost twice as high in its avidity for P-diol-3-G as compared with antiserum raised against P-diol-3-hemisuccinate-BSA. Antiserum to 20alpha-OH-P-3-carboxy-methyl oxime-BSA conjugate was only reactive with 20alpha-OH-P and not with P-diol or P-diol-3-G. From the data presented here, antiserum to P-diol-3-G-BSA with high specificity toward urinary P-diol-3-G was used for the present assays. Ammonium sulfate precipitation was employed for the separation of antibody-bound and free tracer hormones. A direct method in which simply diluted urine was directly applied to RIA and the enzymatic hydrolysis method which requires extraction of P-diol with ether following hydrolysis of urine by beta-glucuronidase were both examined in the present RIA on the same specimens which contained known amounts of 3H-P-diol-3-G. Values obtained by the direct method were in good correlation with those determined by the hydrolysis method (r=0.994 p less than 0.01, Y=1.07X + 0.30). The working range of the assay was from 50pg to 5ng of P-diol per tube, and intra- and interassay precisions were 9.8, 12.5 and 12.9, 16.7%, respectively. Determination of radioimmunoassayable P-diol-3-G in urine was also in good correlation with the values obtained by the currently used analytical procedure, the Klopper-Kambegawa method.</str>

      <str>The distal portion of rotavirus (RV) VP4 spike protein (VP8*) is implicated in binding to cellular receptors, thereby facilitating viral attachment and entry. While VP8* of some animal RVs engage sialic acid, human RVs often attach to and enter cells in a sialic acid-independent manner. A recent study demonstrated that the major human RVs (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) recognize human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). In this study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of RVs and showed further variations of RV interaction with HBGAs. On the basis of the VP8* sequences, RVs are grouped into five P genogroups (P[I] to P[V]), of which P[I], P[IV], and P[V] mainly infect animals, P[II] infects humans, and P[III] infects both animals and humans. The sialic acid-dependent RVs (P[1], P[2], P[3], and P[7]) form a subcluster within P[I], while all three major P genotypes of human RVs (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) are clustered in P[II]. We then characterized three human RVs (P[9], P[14], and P[25]) in P[III] and observed a new pattern of binding to the type A antigen which is distinct from that of the P[II] RVs. The binding was demonstrated by hemagglutination and saliva binding assay using recombinant VP8* and native RVs. Homology modeling and mutagenesis study showed that the locations of the carbohydrate binding interfaces are shared with the sialic acid-dependent RVs, although different amino acids are involved. The P[III] VP8* proteins also bind the A antigens of the porcine and bovine mucins, suggesting the A antigen as a possible factor for cross-species transmission of RVs. Our study suggests that HBGAs play an important role in RV infection and evolution.</str>

      <str>Prorenin, the precursor of renin, binds to the (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] and triggers intracellular signaling. The ligand binding sites of (P)RR are disconnected and are present in the soluble form of the receptor in serum. Given that the clinical significance of serum prorenin and soluble (P)RR in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear, we investigated the relationship between serum prorenin, soluble (P)RR, and various clinical parameters in patients with CKD.</str>
      <str>A total of 374 patients with CKD were enrolled. Serum samples were collected, and the levels of soluble (P)RR and prorenin were measured using ELISA kits. Serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (UA), hemoglobin (Hb), soluble secreted α-Klotho, and the urine protein/Cr ratio were also measured. Similarly, clinical parameters were also evaluated using serum and urine sample collected after 1 year (n = 204).</str>
      <str>Soluble (P)RR levels were positively associated with serum Cr (P &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.263), BUN (P &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.267), UA (P &lt; 0.005, r = 0.168) levels, CKD stage (P &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.311) and urine protein/Cr ratio (P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.157), and inversely with estimated glomerular infiltration rate (eGFR) (P &lt; 0.0001, r = -0.275) and Hb (P &lt; 0.005, r = -0.156). Soluble (P)RR levels were inversely associated with α-Klotho levels (P &lt; 0.001, r = -0.174) but did not correlate with prorenin levels. With respect to antihypertensive drugs, soluble (P)RR levels were significantly lower in patients treated with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) than in those without ARB therapy (P &lt; 0.005). Soluble (P)RR levels were significantly lower in CKD patients with diabetes mellitus or primary hypertension than in those without these conditions (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, serum levels of prorenin did not correlate with parameters related to renal function. Serum prorenin levels were significantly higher in CKD patients with diabetes mellitus than in nondiabetic patients (P &lt; 0.05), but not in CKD patients with hypertension (P = 0.09). Finally, with respect to the relationship between basal soluble (P)RR levels and the progression rates of renal function, soluble (P)RR levels were positively associated with ΔCr (P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.159) and inversely associated with ΔeGFR (P &lt; 0.05, r = -0.148).</str>

      <str>Young leaves of Mangifera indica (mango tree) from nine sites were used as bioindicators of local atmospheric contamination by organochlorine pesticides and metabolites from a point source, an old storage site at Vikuge farm in Tanzania. Sample extracts were analysed by GC-ECD and GC-MS. The concentrations ranged 2.7-649 ng g(-1)p,p'-DDT, below detection limit (bdl)-290 ng g(-1) o,p'-DDT, 0.4-13 ng g(-1) p,p'-DDE, bdl to 4 ng g(-1) o,p'-DDE, 1-231 ng g(-1) p,p'-DDD and 0.5-55 ng g(-1) o,p'-DDD. The concentrations of other compounds were up to 3.9 ng g(-1) pentachloroanisole, 1.3 ng g(-1) alpha-HCH, 12 ng g(-1) beta-HCH and 2 ng g(-1) gamma-HCH, on fresh weight basis. The compounds p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'DDD and o,p'-DDD were found in 100% of the samples, while pentachloroanisole, o,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDE were detected in 78%, 56% and 67% of the samples, respectively. The low DDE/DDT ratios (0.01-0.20) in all samples indicate recent input of significantly non-degraded DDT from the point source. The low alpha-/gamma-HCH ratios (&lt;0.3-0.7) in most samples indicate recent input of lindane (99% gamma-HCH). The slightly high alpha-/gamma-HCH ratios in some samples might be due to photochemical or bacterial transformation of gamma-HCH to alpha-HCH, or could reflect input of technical HCH. The very strong positive correlations in the concentrations of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDD (r=0.91-0.98, n=18, p&lt;0.01) indicate that they have a common source. The results suggest that young mango leaves are suitable bioindicators of recent inputs of organochlorine contaminants from a point source.</str>

      <str>P-selectin (CD62P) is an adhesion molecule expressed on the activated endothelium and activated platelets that is involved in the initial attachment of leukocytes to inflamed vascular endothelium. Blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and P-selectin-deficient mice have shown that P-selectin is a potential target in anti-inflammatory therapy. Most mAbs against P-selectin do not bind to conserved epitopes, including the ligand-binding region, since P-selectin from mammalian species shares high amino acid sequence homology. The aim of this study was to generate a novel panel of anti-P-selectin mAbs against the conserved epitopes present in several animal species. To produce these mAbs, P-selectin-deficient mice were immunized with a pre-B-cell line transfected with human P-selectin cDNA. Twelve mouse mAbs that recognize human P-selectin were obtained. Individual mAbs that bound to human, rat, mouse, rabbit and pig activated platelets were characterized by flow-cytometry, immunohistochemistry, adhesion assays and immunoprecipitation. Four of these mAbs (P-sel.KO.2.3, P-sel.KO.2.4, P-sel.KO.2.7 and P-sel.KO.2.12) cross-reacted with human, rat and mouse P-selectin. Another three mAbs (P-sel.KO.2.2, P-sel.KO.2.11 and P-sel.KO.2.12) blocked the attachment of HL60 cells to P-selectin-transfected COS cells, demonstrating that these mAbs inhibit P-selectin-mediated adhesion. MAb cross-blocking experiments showed that these three mAbs bind to very close and overlapping epitopes. An ELISA assay using mAbs P-sel.KO.2.3 and P-sel.KO.2.12 was designed to measure soluble rat, mouse and human P-selectin. These anti-P-selectin mAbs are unique since they recognize common epitopes conserved during mammalian evolution and they may be useful for studying P-selectin function in inflammatory models in various species.</str>

Four semipurified diets were formulated from each of ingredient to contain graded concentrations of nonphytate P. The experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with 4 weight blocks of 8 cages each (6 birds per cage). A total of 192 broilers (Ross 308), 21 d old, were assigned to the 8 test diets. Ileal digestibility and total tract retention coefficients of P were determined by the indicator and total collection methods, respectively, and linear regression method was used to determine the true P digestibility and true P retention coefficients. The apparent ileal digestibility of P in corn was influenced (quadratic, P &lt; 0.05) by increasing dietary nonphytate P concentrations, whereas P retention was unaffected (P &gt; 0.05). The apparent ileal P digestibility in broilers fed diets based on canola meal was similar (P &gt; 0.05) at different P concentrations. Phosphorus retention in broilers fed diets based on canola meal (linear, P &lt; 0.01) decreased with increasing P concentrations. True ileal P digestibility and true P retention coefficients of corn were determined to be 0.676 and 0.632, respectively. The corresponding values for canola meal were 0.469 and 0.486, respectively. In both ingredients, the determined true ileal digestibility and total tract retention coefficients were not different (P &gt; 0.05). Total P, nonphytate P, true digestible P, and true retainable P contents of corn were determined to be 2.5, 0.8, 1.7, and 1.6 g/kg (as received), respectively. The corresponding values for canola meal were 9.7, 2.8, 4.6, and 4.7 g/kg (as received), respectively. The present data demonstrated that the regression method can be successfully used to measure true P digestibility of low and high P feed ingredients and that both true ileal digestibility and retention coefficients are suitable to assess P availability in broilers.</str>

      <str>Two methylenedioxyphenyl compounds, isosafrole (5-propenyl-1,3-benzodioxole) and an analog, 5-t-butyl-1,3-benzodioxole (BD), differ markedly as inducers of cytochrome P-450 isozymes in rat liver microsomes. Isosafrole is a mixed-type inducer, inducing P-450b, P-450c, and P-450d. In contrast, BD is a phenobarbital-type inducer, increasing P-450b, but producing little or no increase in P-450c or P-450d. Similarly, isosafrole increases the amount of translatable mRNA for P-450b, c and d, while BD induces only the mRNA for P-450b. Dimethylation of the methylene bridge carbon of BD to give 2,2-dimethyl-5-t-butyl-1,3-benzodioxole (DBD) blocks the formation of NADPH-reduced Type III metabolite-P-450 complexes in vitro, and diminishes but does not abolish the ability of the compound to induce P-450b. Western blots of microsomes from isosafrole and BD-treated rat livers confirm that in contrast to isosafrole, BD does not induce P-450d or P-450c. However, the antibody to P-450d recognizes two new polypeptides (approximately 50K Mr) from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of liver microsomes from BD-treated rats. These polypeptides are not observed in control, isosafrole, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), or DBD-treated rats. They are intensified by coadministration of 3-MC with BD and may represent either modified isozyme-metabolite adducts or degradation products of P-450d. However, the polypeptides could not be generated in vitro by addition of BD to 3-MC-induced microsomes with NADPH under conditions which produced spectral metabolite complexes, or in a reconstituted system with P-450d. The two methylenedioxyphenyl compounds do not form stable metabolite complexes with the same P-450 isozymes. BD formed distinct spectral metabolite complexes in vitro with both P-450b and P-450c but not with P-450d in a reconstituted system. In contrast, isosafrole forms metabolite complexes with all three isozymes. Coadministration of 3-MC with BD blocked induction of P-450b by 80% and produced a similar repression of its translatable mRNA. This finding indicates that 3-MC type inducers not only induce certain cytochrome P-450 isozymes, but also repress synthesis of other isozymes.</str>

      <str>Phorbol myristate acetate (PM A) increased the formation of |(32)P | PI 4,5-P, in (32)P-prelabeled human platelet. In saponin-permeabilized platelets, in which (32)P from exogenous |γ-(32)P| ATP was incorporated into PI 4-P and PI 4,5-P(2), addition of 10 nM PMA resulted in increased formation of |(32)P|PI 4,5-P(2) and |(32)P|PI 4-P. In order to distinguish whether increased [(32)P]PI 4,5-P(2) formation by PMA reflected merely an increase of [(32)P]PI 4-P, the substrate for PI 4-P 5-kinase, or activation of PI 4-P Skinase, we examined the membrane fraction in which most of the kinase activity was located. Although PMA itself did not affect the PI 4-P 5-kinase activity in the control membranes, the kinase activity was increased nearly 2-fold in membranes pretreated with 10 nM PMA but not 4α-phorbol didecanoate which does not activate protein kinase C (PKC). These results suggested that membrane PI 4-P 5-kinase activity was stimulated by the activation of PKC. However, 100 nM PMA did not stimulate [(32)P]PI 4,s-P(2) formation in saponin-permeabilized platelets, and the PI 4-P 5-kinase activity in membranes from platelets pretreated with 100 nM PMA was almost the same as that in control membranes. This can be explained by product inhibition, since PI 4,5-P(2) inhibited concentration-dependently the membrane PI 4-P 5-kinase activity. The Ca(2+) -dependent PKC fraction partially purified from the platelet cytosol stimulated the membrane PI 4-P 5-kinase activity, whereas the Ca(2)'-independent PKC fraction inhibited the kinase activity. Taken together, the present results suggest that the platelet membrane PI 4-P 5-kinase activity is stimulated by Ca(2+) -dependent PKC (cPKC) and is negatively regulated by PI 4,s-p(2) and Ca(2+) -independent PKC(nPKC).</str>

      <str>Both sexes of BALB/c X DBA/2 F1 mice and F344 rats were treated for 1 week with a diet containing 0.02% of hepatocarcinogenic tryptophan pyrolysate component (Trp P-1 or Trp P-2), and changes in the carcinogen activation enzyme activity in various organs were examined comparatively using a mutation test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as a tester bacterium. Hepatic enzymes from untreated mice and rats showed a definite catalytic activity for mutagenic activations of Trp P-1 and Trp P-2, whereas the activities of other organs--such as lung, kidney, small intestine and colon--were undetectable or very low. In both mice and rats either the Trp P-1 or Trp P-2 feeding resulted in induction of cytochrome P-450 isozyme(s), which could mediate in the liver but not in other organs the mutagenic activation of the carcinogen itself. As to the sex difference, the induction of the activation enzyme(s) was greater in the female animals than in the males. Species difference in the activity of hepatic enzymes catalyzing the Trp P-1 and Trp P-2 mutageneses was also observed in animals treated with the basal diet; the activity was higher in mice than in the sex-matched rats (Trp P-1, approximately 1.5-fold; Trp P-2, approximately 7-fold). When diet containing Trp P-1 or Trp P-2 was fed for 1 week, the activity of the rat liver for Trp P-1 mutagenesis was of a level similar to that of the sex-matched mice, but for Trp P-2 mutagenesis it was less than half that in the mice. The induced hepatic enzymes in mice and rats were suggested to be 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochrome P-448 isozymes as determined by mutation tests with Trp P-1, Trp P-2 and two other substrates and by immunochemical analyses of rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 using monoclonal antibodies against rat cytochrome P-448 isozymes. These results indicate that a form of cytochrome P-450 responsible for activation of Trp P-1 and Trp P-2 is inducible by dietary treatment of mice or rats with these carcinogens and that the amount of the cytochrome P-450, including resident and induced forms, is related to the species, sex and organ differences in their carcinogenic susceptibility to these chemicals.</str>

      <str>The presence of rotavirus strains in sewage samples from Cairo, Egypt (November 1998 to October 1999), and Barcelona, Spain (November 1998 to December 2002), was investigated by using a generic molecular detection method based on amplification of a VP6 gene fragment. Overall, 85.7 and 66.9% of the sewage samples from Cairo and Barcelona, respectively, were positive. Positive samples were characterized further, and VP7 and VP4 genotypes were determined. Although 30% of the positive samples from Cairo were G untypeable, the distribution of G types in the positive samples was 69.6% G1, 13% G3, 8.7% G4, and 8.7% G9. The percentage of untypeable samples was much higher for the Barcelona samples (56.5%), and the distribution in the positive samples was 56.4% G1, 31.5% G3, 6% G9, 4% G2, and 2% G5. When the P types were examined, 26.7% of the positive samples from Cairo were untypeable, and the distribution of types in the positive samples was 53.3% P[8], 30% P[6], and 16.6% P[4]. In Barcelona, 27.2% of the samples were P untypeable, and the frequencies of the types detected were 49.7% P[8], 37.2% P[4], 8.8% P[6], and 4.2% P[9]. The distribution for strains from Cairo was 38.5% P[8]G1, 27% P[6]G1, 11.5% P[4]G1, 11.5% P[8]G3, 7.7% P[6]G4, and 3.8% P[8]G9. Strikingly, equivalent frequencies of common and uncommon strains were observed for Barcelona samples, and the distribution was 38.8% P[8]G1, 30.6% P[4]G1, 11.6% P[8]G3, 6.6% P[4]G3, 5.8% P[6]G1, 1.6% P[6]G3, 1.6% P[9]G1, 0.8% P[4]G2, 0.8% P[6]G9, 0.8% P[8]G9, and 0.8% P[8]G5. Additionally, two P[-]G5 strains were isolated in Barcelona, and the porcine or human origin of these strains was unclear.

      <str>A gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry method was developed for analysis of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in coral samples, which were extracted with accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and cleaned up on a sulfuric acid-modified silica gel column. The optimal ASE conditions were found to be 100 degrees C and 2000 psi, with a mixture of acetone and methylene chloride (1:1, v/v). The target analytes include hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs, specifically, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-HCH isomers), heptachlor, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p'-, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p'-, p,p'-DDT), o,p'-, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (o,p'-, p,p'-DDE), and o,p'-, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (o,p'-, p,p'-DDD). Standard sand samples were used as an alternative matrix spiked with OCP standards to determine the method precision and accuracy. Average recoveries of OCPs ranged from 82% to 102%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 3%-6%, at a level of 10 ng/g and from 50% to 68%, with RSDs of 13%-19% at a level of 2 ng/g. The developed method was applied for analysis of OCPs in coral samples collected from Tern Island and Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The concentrations of HCB were 7-26 pg/g dry weight in the samples from Bikini Atoll and 3-45 pg/g in those from Tern Island, and heptachlor concentrations were 208-2200 and 44-104 pg/g in the coral samples from Bikini Atoll and Tern Island, respectively. (summation operator)HCH (sum of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-HCH) were 8-82 pg/g in Bikini Atoll coral and 86-629 pg/g in Tern island coral, and (summation operator)DDT (sum of o,p'-, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-, p,p'-DDE, and o,p'- p,p'-DDT) were 80-212 pg/g in Bikini Atoll coral and 593-3165 pg/g in Tern Island coral. The results suggest that coral is a viable indicator species for pollution monitoring, which pollutants and their concentrations may be related to dated carbonate layers.</str>

      <str>The distribution of a soluble form of a cell adhesion molecule, P-selectin, in human platelets and cultivated endothelial cells has been studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The concentration of soluble P-selectin in the blood plasma of healthy donors and patients with abnormal platelet count has also been determined. P-selectin was measured in the Triton X-100 lysate of platelets and endothelial cells (total P-selectin), in the 100,000g supernatant obtained after sedimentation of the membrane fraction from the homogenate of sonicated platelets and endothelial cells (intracellular soluble P-selectin), in the supernatant of activated and nonactivated platelets, and in the culture medium of endothelial cells. A soluble form of P-selectin which did not coprecipitate with the membrane fraction was detected in platelets and accounted for approximately 10% of the total P-selectin. Platelet activation by thrombin, ADP, or a thromboxane A2 analog resulted in the secretion of 30-50% of the intracellular soluble P-selectin. Measurements of P-selectin in endothelial cell culture revealed that endothelium from aorta contained about twofold more P-selectin than endothelium from umbilical vein. Intracellular soluble P-selectin was identified in both types of endothelial cells. In endothelial cells from the umbilical vein this form made up approximately 10% of the total P-selectin. Soluble P-selectin was also detected in the medium of cultivated endothelial cells, where its content correlated with the total cellular P-selectin. Concentration of P-selectin in blood plasma strongly correlated with the platelet count in the blood of healthy donors and patients with thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia. These data indicate that platelets serve as one of the main source of plasma P-selectin. However, the presence of P-selectin in the plasma of patients with severe thrombocytopenia suggests that endothelium can also be involved in plasma P-selectin production. Thus, in vitro experiments as well as measurements of plasma P-selectin have shown that both platelets and endothelial cells can produce a soluble form of the protein. Platelet-derived soluble P-selectin and plasma P-selectin were shown to react with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin. These data prove that at least part of soluble P-selectin is produced by synthesis employing special mRNA which lacks the sequence encoding the transmembrane domain, but not by the proteolytic shedding of the extracellular portion of membrane P-selectin.</str>

      <str>The time course of induction of rat liver microsomal cytochromes P-450a, P-450b + P-450e, P-450c, and P-450d and epoxide hydrolase has been determined in immature male rats administered a single large dose [1500 mumol (500 mg)/kg body wt] of the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254. Differential regulation of these xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes was indicated by their characteristic patterns of induction. The rate of induction of cytochrome P-450a and epoxide hydrolase was relatively slow, and steady-state levels of these enzymes were maintained from approximately Days 9 to 15 after Aroclor 1254 treatment. In contrast, cytochrome P-450c was maximally induced 2 days after Aroclor 1254 treatment and remained at a constant level through Day 15. Steady-state levels of cytochrome P-450d, beginning 1 week after Aroclor 1254 treatment, were preceded by a fairly rapid rate of induction and possibly by a small decline from maximal levels observed around Days 4 to 5. Like those of the other cytochrome P-450 isozymes and epoxide hydrolase, the levels of cytochromes P-450b + P-450e were constant from Day 9 to 15 after Aroclor 1254 treatment. However, an unexpected but reproducible decline (approximately 25%) in total cytochrome P-450 content observed between Days 4 and 9 after Aroclor 1254 treatment principally reflected a dramatic and totally unanticipated decrease (approximately 45%) in the level of cytochromes P-450b + P-450e. This transient decline in the level of cytochromes P-450b + P-450e was not due to an unusual effect of a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls, since identical results were obtained with two individual congeners, namely 2,3,4,5,4'-penta- and 2,3,4,5,3',4'-hexachlorobiphenyl, that induced the same isozymes as Aroclor 1254. In contrast, when rats were treated with 2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl, which induces cytochromes P-450a and P-450b + P-450e and epoxide hydrolase but not cytochromes P-450c or P-450d, maximal levels of cytochromes P-450b + P-450e were attained on Day 4 and no decrease was observed over the next 11 days. These results suggest that there may be an interaction in the regulation of induction of certain individual cytochrome P-450 isozymes.</str>

      <str>NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase (CPR) is essential for the catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450 (P-450). On a molar basis, the amount of P-450 exceeds that of CPR in human liver. In this study, we investigated whether drug-drug interactions can occur as a result of competition between P-450 isozymes for this ancillary protein. For this purpose, combinations of P-450 isozymes were coexpressed together with P-450 reductase in Escherichia coli. We show that testosterone inhibited the CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity in bacterial membranes containing both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 but not in membranes containing CYP2D6 alone. Conversely, bufuralol inhibited the CYP3A4-mediated testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity in bacterial membranes containing both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 but not in membranes containing only CYP3A4. In each case, inhibition was seen even at a P-450 to P-450 reductase ratio of 1.9:1, which is more favorable than the ratio of 4 reported for human liver. The physiological significance of this mechanism was demonstrated by the observation that testosterone inhibited several prototypical P-450 enzyme activities, such as bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase, coumarin 7-hydroxylase, and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, in human liver microsomes, but not if tested against a panel of bacterial membranes containing the human P-450 isozymes that mainly catalyze these reactions.</str>

      <str>Increasing evidence indicates that lipophilic and/or protein-bound substances such as p-cresol are responsible for adverse physiological alterations in uraemic patients. To better understand the evolution of p-cresol disposition in renal failure and dialysis patients, it is necessary to determine its kinetic characteristics and biotransformation pathways.</str>
      <str>We studied the biotransformation of p-cresol after intravenous injection of the compound in eight rats with normal renal function. Urine was collected in four 1 h intervals. To evaluate the presence of p-cresol metabolites, beta-glucuronidase was added to urine samples and the isolated unidentified chromatographic peak observed in previous experiments was submitted to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis.</str>
      <str>Administration of p-cresol produced a p-cresol peak and an unknown peak, suggesting biotransformation of the compound. Addition of beta-glucuronidase to urine samples and incubation at 37 degrees C resulted in a marked decrease in the unidentified peak height (P&lt;0.001) together with an increase in p-cresol peak height (P&lt;0.001), suggesting that the unidentified peak was composed, at least in part, of p-cresylglucuronide. Mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS analysis of the isolated unidentified peak confirmed the presence of p-cresylglucuronide. Linear regression between the peak height of p-cresylglucuronide before enzyme treatment and the increase in p-cresol peak height after enzyme treatment in samples incubated with beta-glucuronidase allowed us to calculate the amount of p-cresylglucuronide as its p-cresol equivalents. This revealed that 64% of the injected p-cresol was excreted as glucuronide. There was no change in peak heights when sulphatase was added to the urine. When p-cresol and p-cresylglucuronide levels were combined, approximately 85% of all administered p-cresol was recovered in the urine. In addition, the combined urinary excretion of p-cresol and p-cresylglucuronide was more than four times greater than excretion of p-cresol by itself (P&lt;0.01).</str>
      <str>In rats with normal renal function, intravenous administration of p-cresol results in immediate and extensive metabolization of the compound into p-cresylglucuronide. The elimination of p-cresol from the body depends largely on the urinary excretion of this metabolite.</str>

      <str>Cyclophosphamide was administered to adult male rats (130 mg/kg, single i.p. injection) and its effects on the P-450 enzymes that contribute to the activation of this drug in rat liver were then assessed. P-450-mediated cyclophosphamide 4-hydroxylase activity in isolated rat liver microsomes decreased by approximately 70% over a 9-day period following drug treatment. This decrease was due to the loss of cytochrome P-450 form 2c (IIC11), a major contributor to cyclophosphamide 4-hydroxylation in untreated male rat liver, while the other major hepatic cyclophosphamide 4-hydroxylase, P-450 PB-1 (IIC6), was largely unaffected. The loss of P-450 2c activity did not result from a decrease in P-450 reductase or from direct inactivation of the P-450 protein by cyclophosphamide or its metabolites, but rather was due to a reduction in hepatic P-450 2c protein and mRNA levels. Hepatic P-450 2a (IIIA2) and P-450 RLM2 (IIA2) were also suppressed by cyclophosphamide treatment. Serum testosterone, which contributes to the expression of P-450s 2c, 2a, and RLM2, was severely depleted in the cyclophosphamide-treated rats; however, this loss was not the direct cause of the decreases in these hepatic P-450s, since the decreases were not reversed upon restoration of normal testosterone levels by human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation of testicular androgen production. In contrast to the suppression of these testosterone-dependent P-450s, P-450 3 (IIA1), P-450j (IIE1), and the P-450-independent microsomal enzyme steroid 5 alpha-reductase were each elevated in rat liver following cyclophosphamide administration. In contrast to P-450 3 and steroid 5 alpha-reductase, however, the elevation of P-450j protein was transient and was not accompanied by an increase in P-450j-associated hepatic microsomal aniline hydroxylase activity. In vitro experiments revealed that P-450j was severalfold more susceptible to inactivation by the cyclophosphamide metabolite acrolein as compared with P-450 3. These observations suggest that P-450j protein is induced by cyclophosphamide treatment but that the protein is inactivated by the cyclophosphamide metabolite acrolein. These findings establish that cyclophosphamide treatment can modulate hepatic P-450 activities through multiple mechanisms and in a manner that may alter P-450 metabolism of cyclophosphamide and perhaps other anticancer drugs that undergo bioactivation in the liver.</str>

      <str>Specific immunochemical techniques were used to quantitate the levels of eight isozymes of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) and epoxide hydrolase in liver microsomes of untreated rats and rats treated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, a mixture of these two compounds, nine individual polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) congeners, and a commercial mixture of PBBs. Levels of two 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible P-450s (designated P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G) varied over two orders of magnitude and were highly correlated. The levels of four phenobarbital-inducible P-450s (designated P-450PB-B, P-450PB-C, P-450PB-D, and P-450PB/PCN-E) were all correlated to each other. The level of one form, P-450UT-A, which was present at substantial levels in untreated rats, was inversely correlated to the levels of P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G. Among the PBB congeners which were examined, the presence of bromine at carbons o to the biphenyl bridge favored the induction of P-450PB-B, P-450PB-C, P-450PG-D, and P-450PB/PCN-E but did not necessarily eliminate the ability to induce P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF-ISF-G. PBB congeners with 2,2'-dibromo substitution induced P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G if one of the biphenyl rings contained bromines at positions 2,3, and 4. The induction of P-450UT-F was found to occur to a small extent with three of the compounds and is not readily explained in terms of structure-activity relationships. Although correlations were found among levels of some of the forms of P-450, several important exceptions were noted in relative levels of the individual enzymes. While the correlative data are useful in predicting induction patterns, all eight forms of P-450 appear to be independently regulated to some extent.</str>

      <str>Ninety-six weanling pigs (initial BW = 9.3 kg, initial age = 37 d) were used in a 4-wk experiment to evaluate the response to three Ca: total (t) P ratios (1.2:1, 1.6:1, or 2.0:1) fed in combination with two P levels (.07 or .16% available that correspond to .36 or .45% tP) and two phytase levels (PY; 700 or 1,050 units/kg of diet). A 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was employed using a corn-soybean meal diet. Performance, serum mineral concentrations and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Ca and P digestibility and excretion, and bone mechanical measurements were examined. Average daily gain (P &lt; .001), average daily feed intake (P &lt; .01), and gain:feed (P &lt; .05) were decreased linearly as the Ca:tP ratio became wider. The digestibility of P and Ca were decreased (P &lt; .001) linearly as the Ca:tP ratio became wider. The digestibility of P (P &lt; .001) and fecal P excretion (P &lt; .01) were increased at the higher level of P. Increasing PY from 700 to 1,050 units (U)/kg of diet increased (P &lt; .05) P digestibility and decreased (P &lt; .01) P excretion but did not improve bone measurements. Shear force, stress and energy, and percentage of ash of both metacarpal and 10th rib linearly decreased (P &lt; .001 to .05) as the Ca:tP ratio became wider, and bone measurements were generally greater for pigs fed the higher P level. Serum Ca concentration increased (P &lt; .01) and the P concentration decreased (P &lt; .001) as the Ca:tP ratio increased, but Mg, Zn, and ALP activity were not influenced by the Ca:tP ratio. Serum Ca and P concentrations were affected by PY supplementation over the 4-wk trial, but serum Mg and Zn concentrations were not affected by dietary treatments. Adverse effects of a wide Ca:tP ratio were greater at the low P diet for all responses. In addition, the activity of supplemental PY in diets seemed to be decreased as the Ca:tP ratio became wider and this negative effect of Ca:tP ratio seemed greater at the low P level, and seemed to parallel the effects of Ca:tP ratio on performance, P digestibility, bone, and serum measurements. Narrowing the dietary Ca:total P ratio from 2.0:1 to 1.2:1 led to an approximate 16% increase in phytase efficacy for improving performance, digestibility, bone measurements, and serum Ca levels.</str>

      <str>An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the dietary inclusion rate of P does not influence the digestibility of P. The experiment was conducted at 4 experiment stations where the same protocol was followed. A total of 60 growing pigs (initial BW: 22.22 +/- 2.13 kg) were allotted to 6 dietary treatments with 10 replications per treatment. All pigs were placed in metabolism cages that allowed for the total, but separate, collection of urine and fecal materials. Six diets were formulated. The basal diet was based on corn (54.2%), soybean meal (20%), and cornstarch. No inorganic P was used, and the total concentration of P in the basal diet was calculated to be 0.29%. Five additional diets were formulated by adding monocalcium phosphate (MCP) in increments of 0.34% to the basal diet and thereby creating diets that were calculated to contain 0.36, 0.43, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.64% total P, respectively. Ground limestone was also added to these diets to maintain a calculated Ca:P ratio of 1.2:1. The balances of Ca and P and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of Ca and P were calculated for each diet. The contribution of P from the basal diet was then subtracted from the MCP-containing diets to calculate the balance and ATTD for P in MCP. Results of the experiment showed that the absorption and retention of both Ca and P increased (linear, P &lt; 0.001) with increasing concentrations of Ca and P in the diet. The ATTD for Ca ranged from 62.3 to 66.8% and was not influenced by the dietary concentration of Ca. However, the ATTD for P increased from 38.4 to 65.2% as increasing levels of MCP were added to the diet (linear, P &lt; 0.001). Increasing P intake from MCP increased (linear, P &lt; 0.001) the excretion of P in the feces, but the quantity of P that was absorbed and retained also increased (linear, P &lt; 0.001) as more P from MCP was added to the diet. When measured as a percentage of P intake, P retention was not influenced by the dietary P concentration. The ATTD for P in MCP ranged from 79.5 to 88.5% and was not affected by the concentration of P in the diet. Results of this experiment demonstrated that the digestibility and absorption of P from MCP are not influenced by the dietary concentration of P.</str>

      <str>In this study, we determined whether the DDT isomers p,p'-DDT [1,1,1,-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], o,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)ethane], and their metabolites p,p'-DDD [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], o,p'-DDD [1,1-dichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)ethane], p,p'-DDE [1,1,-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene], o,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)ethylene], and p,p'-DDA [2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetic acid], could bind to and transcriptionally activate the human estrogen receptor (hER). Novel results from competitive binding assays showed that o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT, as well as the established environmental estrogen o,p'-DDT, were able to bind specifically to the hER with approximately 1000-fold weaker affinities for the hER than that of estradiol. In contrast, only o,p'-DDT, but not p,p'-DDT, bound to the rat estrogen receptor. Moreover, two yeast expression-reporter systems, constructed to test if the DDT isomers and metabolites could transcriptionally activate the hER, demonstrated that an o,p'-DDT metabolite could transactivate the hER or LexA-hER fusion protein with just a 140- to 300-fold weaker potency than that of estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that bound the hER in vitro triggered estrogen receptor-mediated transcription of the lacZ reporter gene in the yeast systems. Furthermore, the DDT isomers and metabolites that transactivated the hER elicited an additive response when given together or with estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that triggered transcription of the yeast expression-reporter systems also stimulated two estrogenic endpoints in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells: the induction of the progesterone receptor and the down-regulation of the hER. Thus, in MCF-7 cells and in yeast expression-reporter systems, certain DDT isomers and metabolites act directly as agonists and transactivate the hER at concentrations found in human tissues.</str>

      <str>Despite improvements in pharmacological and mechanical devices, the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) is still high, particularly in prothrombotic conditions. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with enhanced platelet function, impaired endothelial function and prothrombotic status, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. No study has, so far, investigated the relationship between homocysteine levels and the risk of periprocedural MI in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this is therefore the aim of the current study.</str>
      <str>In 1150 patients undergoing PCI, homocysteinemia was assessed at admission. Cardiac biomarkers were measured at intervals from 8 to 48 h after PCI. Periprocedural myonecrosis was defined by a troponin I increase to three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or by 50% if elevated at the time of the procedure. PMI was defined as a CK-MB increase to three times the ULN or of 50% if elevated at the time of the procedure.</str>
      <str>We grouped patients according to tertile values of homocysteine. Higher homocysteine levels were associated with older age (P &lt; 0.001), male sex (P = 0.02), arterial hypertension (P = 0.007), diabetes (P = 0.04), renal failure (P &lt; 0.001), higher creatinine levels (P = 0.01), previous MI (P = 0.02), previous PCI (P = 0.04) and previous cerebrovascular accidents (P = 0.01). Homocysteine was associated with lower ejection fraction (P &lt; 0.001), treatment with angiotensin-receptor blockers (P &lt; 0.001), nitrates (P = 0.008) and diuretics (P &lt; 0.001) and acetylsalicylic acid (P = 0.01). Homocysteine levels were directly related with the extent of coronary disease (P = 0.04) and coronary calcifications (P &lt; 0.001) but inversely with type C lesions (P = 0.001), TIMI 3 flow pre-PCI (P = 0.02), stenosis severity (P = 0.01) and thrombus (P = 0.004). In addition, they are associated with higher rates of balloon predilatation (P = 0.02), lower use of thrombectomy (P = 0.01) and periprocedural administration of GPIIbIIIa inhibitors (P = 0.02). Ageing, male sex, diabetes, renal failure, creatinine levels, diuretics use, coronary calcifications and type C lesions were independently related to homocysteine. Homocysteine did not affect the risk of PMI [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.14 (0.91-1.42), P = 0.26], or periprocedural myonecrosis [adjusted OR 1.17 (0.98-1.39), P = 0.08]. Similar results were found after propensity score adjustment [adjusted OR 1.19 (0.95-1.48), P = 0.14 for PMI and adjusted OR 1.18 (0.99-1.4), P = 0.07 for myonecrosis] and at subgroup analysis in higher risk subsets of patients.</str>

      <str>The manner of presentation of research results may affect how clinicians interpret research and make clinical decisions. The authors evaluate whether the use of confidence levels improve research interpretation and decision making compared with P values and 95% confidence intervals.</str>
      <str>The 2 Presentation and Interpretation of Medical Research (PRIMER) studies were 3-arm randomized trials. PRIMER 1 presented results of 5 fictitious scenarios with P values (P), P plus 95% confidence intervals (P + CI), or P, CI, and confidence levels (P + CI + CL); PRIMER 2 compared P + CI + CL, P + CI, and P + CL. Clinicians were asked to identify the correct interpretation of scenarios in terms of statistical and clinical significance and then indicate the intended decision making in terms of treatment recommendation.</str>
      <str>Seventy-five and 246 clinicians participated in PRIMER 1 and PRIMER 2, respectively. In PRIMER 1, P+CI+CL was superior to P + CI and P (P &lt; 0.05); the latter 2 arms did not differ significantly. Decision making was not significantly different between arms. In PRIMER 2, P+CI+CL resulted in better interpretation than P + CI (P = 0.03), with no difference between P + CI and P + CL. In combined analysis, the odds of correct interpretation were higher for P+CI+CL than P+CI (odds ratio = 1.73, P=0.005, 95% CI= 1.19--2.52). Decision making was better for P + CI+ CL (P = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, the P + CI+ CL arm and clinicians with statistics training, not in private practice, or participating in PRIMER 1 had better interpretation. The P + CI+ CL arm was the only factor improving decision making.</str>

      <str>Heart failure complicated by atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with excessive mortality and morbidity. The aim of the study was to determine the role of amiodarone or implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) in patients with AF and heart failure.</str>
      <str>Patients were determined to be in sinus rhythm (SR) or AF on the baseline electrocardiogram. Mortality, ICD discharge, or change in rhythm was assessed.</str>
      <str>Of the 2521 patients at baseline, 2328 were in SR and 173 were in AF. Overall, after adjusting for differences in baseline variables, there was no difference in mortality between patients with SR and patients with AF (P = .98), nor within assigned groups: placebo (P) (P = .82), amiodarone (A) (P = .68), and ICD (P = .40). For patients with SR, ICD decreased mortality (P vs ICD, P = .004; A vs ICD, P = .004; P vs A, P = .75). For patients with AF, there were no differences in mortality among groups (P vs ICD, P = .99; A vs ICD, P = .88; P vs A, P = .88). Of patients with SR at baseline, 11% (264) developed AF by any electrocardiogram during follow-up (P 12%, A 8%, ICD 15%; A vs P, P = .019; A vs ICD, P = .001; P vs ICD, P = .044). Of patients with AF, 70% (121) developed SR during follow-up (P 66%, A 67%, ICD 75%, all P = not significant against each other). Any ICD shock was seen in 52% (34) of patients with AF vs 30% (222) of patients with SR (P = .001). Inappropriate shocks were seen in 37% (24) of patients with AF vs 14% (107) of patients with SR (P = .001). Appropriate shocks were more often seen in AF vs SR (P = .03).</str>
      <str>After adjustments for baseline differences, patients with AF and patients with SR have similar overall mortality rates. Compared to P or A, ICD improves survival in patients with SR, but may not in patients with AF. Amiodarone is effective in reducing new AF, but not in converting AF to SR. Implantable cardioverter/defibrillator, inappropriate, and appropriate shocks were more often seen in AF than in SR.</str>

      <str>Fifty stable HD patients more than 65 years old were enrolled from a single medical center. Serum total and free PCS, IS levels and biochemistry were measured concurrently.

Multivariate analysis showed that diabetes (p = 0.01), total PCS (p = 0.01) and free PCS (p = 0.04) were related to cardiovascular events. For all-cause mortality, only total PCS (p = 0.01) reached significance after adjusting other confounding factors. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that free PCS (p = 0.02) and total PCS (p &lt; 0.01) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events and total PCS (p = 0.048) was related to all-cause mortality during 38-month follow-up.</str>

      <str>The mercury resistance module of Bacillus transposon TnMERI1 is regulated by three operator/promoter regions (O/P merB3, O/P merR1, and O/P merR2) and two regulatory proteins (MerR1 and MerR2) encoded by the module itself. To clarify the roles of MerR1 and MerR2 in the regulatory mechanism, both proteins were overexpressed and purified. MerR1 bound the regulatory regions O/P merB3 and O/P merR1, with a preference for O/P merB3 as measured on in vitro gel shift assays. However, MerR2 bound O/P merR2, as revealed by gel shift and restriction endonuclease protection assays. The transcriptional start sites of O/P merB3 and O/P merR2 were determined by rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends (5'-RACE) in the TnMERI1 original host, Bacillus megaterium strain MB1. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays showed that O/P merB3 and O/P merR1 were induced in the presence of Hg2+ but not O/P merR2. It was concluded that MerR1 regulates O/P merB3 and O/P merR1, while MerR2 regulates O/P merR2.</str>

      <str>The concentrations of different sedimentary phosphorus forms and bioavailable phosphorus were studied and the formation mechanism of BAP in sediments was discussed, under the conditions of sediments re-suspension. The results show that sediment re-suspension had obvious effect on the distribution of different sedimentary phosphorus forms. The BD-P, Al-P, Ca-P were increased evidently and the NH4Cl-P was decreased with the time of sediment re-suspension extending. The BAP in sediments after re-suspended was reduced by 6.59%, indicating that sediment re-suspension could promote the transformation from BAP to nonbioavailable phosphorus. The formation of AAP might mainly have close relationships with BD-P. After extracting AAP, the BD-P was decreased by 33.4% averagely in the sediments after re-suspended, while the release of BD-P in sediments from the control experiment was increased by 19.8%, showing that the formation of AAP was affected marked by the properties of BD-P. The Olsen-P could be mainly formed from BD-P, Al-P, NaOH-nrP. The formation of Olsen-P was closely correlated to BD-P, based on the release of BD-P, Al-P, NaOH-nrP.</str>

      <str>The American Polistes species venom mixture--that of P. annularis, P. fuscatus, P. metricus and P. exclamans--was the only commercially available mixture for diagnosis and therapy until 1996. However, these species of Polistes are not present in Europe, where P. dominulus and P. gallicus and to a lesser extent P. nimphus are widespread. The aim of this study was to assess the allergenic differences among the commercial American mix, P. dominulus and P. gallicus venom in European patients and therefore to verify if this mixture is suitable for diagnosis in these patients. We carried out skin tests, radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) and RAST inhibition in Italian patients with adverse reactions to Polistes stings. RAST inhibition results demonstrated that cross-reactivity between the American and European species is only partial and that P. dominulus and P. gallicus venoms have exclusive allergens. Skin tests and direct RAST confirmed these results and also showed that European Polistes venom is more suitable than the American mix in Italian patients. Moreover, we found a high rate of cross-reactivity between P. dominulus and P. gallicus. To conclude, P. dominulus and/or P. gallicus venoms are necessary for diagnosis and therefore in the therapy of European patients.</str>

A total of 46 strains representing the species P. jensenii and P. thoenii and the former species "P. rubrum" and also including 21 reference strains and 25 strains isolated from dairy sources were studied. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain "P. rubrum" CNRZ 85 (= ATCC 4871) was found to be almost identical to that of the type strain of P. jensenii. DNA hybridization data indicated that "P. rubrum" should belong to the species P. jensenii rather than P. thoenii, as formerly proposed. The "P. rubrum" strains should then be reclassified as a beta-haemolytic biovar of P. jensenii. The genomic species P. jensenii and P. thoenii could be differentiated by biochemical characteristics such as the production of acid from myo-inositol and starch.</str>

      <str>Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant disease with poor prognosis. The main pharmacological choice, o,p'-DDD (mitotane), produces severe adverse effects. Since o,p'-DDD is a chiral molecule and stereoisomers frequently possess different pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties, we isolated the two o,p'-DDD enantiomers, (R)-(+)-o,p'-DDD and (S)-(-)-o,p'-DDD, and determined their absolute structures. The effects of each enantiomer on cell viability and on cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) secretion in the human adrenocortical cell line H295R were assessed. We also assayed the o,p'-DDD racemate and the m,p'- and p,p'-isomers. The results show small but statistically significant differences in activity of the o,p'-DDD enantiomers for all parameters tested. The three DDD isomers were equally potent in decreasing cell viability, but p,p'-DDD affected hormone secretion slightly less than the o,p'- and m,p'-isomers. The small chiral differences in direct effects on target cells alone do not warrant single enantiomer administration, but might reach importance in conjunction with possible stereochemical effects on pharmacokinetic processes in vivo.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this paper was to examine the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of preterm singleton pregnancies complicated by placental abruption following preterm premature rupture of membranes (p-PROM) compared with those without p-PROM. We reviewed the obstetric records of 95 singleton deliveries complicated by placental abruption at 22-36 weeks' gestation. The incidence of placental abruption in singleton pregnancies with p-PROM was 4.7%, and the crude odds ratio of placental abruption for women following p-PROM was 6.50 (P &lt; 0.01). Of the 95 cases of placental abruption in preterm singleton deliveries, 64 cases (67.4%) occurred without p-PROM and 31 cases (32.6%) occurred following p-PROM. The incidence of histological chorioamnionitis stage III in the patients following p-PROM was significantly higher than that in the patients without p-PROM (P = 0.02). The rate of emergency Cesarean deliveries associated with nonreassuring fetal status (NRFS) in the patients following p-PROM was significantly lower than that in the patients without p-PROM. However, there were no significant differences in the maternal and neonatal outcomes between the patients with and without p-PROM. Although p-PROM may be one of important risk factors for placental abruption associated with chorioamnionitis, it may not influence the perinatal outcomes in preterm placental abruption.</str>

      <str>Consistent with prior studies, spaceflight was associated with a significant increase in the number of circulating white blood cells (p &lt;.01), including neutrophils (p &lt;.01), monocytes (p &lt;.05), CD3+CD4+ T-helper cells (p &lt;.05), and CD19+ B cells (p &lt;.01). In contrast, the number of CD3-CD16+56+ natural killer cells was decreased (p &lt;.01). Plasma norepinephrine levels were increased at landing (p &lt;.01) and were significantly correlated with the number of white blood cells (p &lt;.01), neutrophils (p &lt;.01), monocytes (p &lt;.01), and B cells (p &lt;.01). Astronauts who were in space for approximately 1 week showed a significantly larger increase on landing in plasma norepinephrine (p =.02) and epinephrine (p =.03) levels, as well as number of circulating CD3+CD4+ T-helper cells (p &lt;.05) and CD3+CD8+ T-cytotoxic cells (p &lt;.05) as compared with astronauts in space for approximately 2 weeks.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) sorption of light weight aggregate, Filtralite P has been examined through a box experiment which imitates a horizontal subsurface flow wetland system. The results showed that after the P breakthrough, the outlet P concentration increased with time according to the amount of P applied. Small scale boxes with a high inlet P concentration (15 ppm) and high loading rate (5-2.5 L d(-1)) reached 90% saturation level relatively quickly (after about 150 days of operation), while the boxes with low hydraulic loading rate (1.25 L day(-1)) were 70-90% saturated after 18 months of operation. The total P removal was dependent on pH, Ca, and the inlet P concentrations, but was independent of the hydraulic loading rate. Extraction of total P from the saturated filter material showed that the sorbed P accumulated within the inlet section of the box and decreased gradually towards the outlet as well as towards the bottom layer. Even after large amounts of Ca had leached out of the system, Filtralite P still had a very high P removal capacity. After resting periods the P sorption capacity of the material was regenerated, the P concentration in the effluent decreased by 22-53%.</str>

      <str>An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of one alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol (1α-OH D3) on growth performance, tibia quality, and skin and meat color in broilers fed calcium (Ca)- and phosphorus (P)-deficient corn-soybean meal diets. A total of 288 male Ross broilers, at 21 days of age, were randomly assigned to three treatments with eight cages per treatment. Three levels of 1α-OH D3 (0, 5, and 10 μg/kg) were added to a basal diet (0.50% Ca, 0.13% non-phytate phosphorus (NPP), and 0.35% total phosphorus (tP)) without vitamin D3. As a result of this study, the addition of 1α-OH D3 increased body weight gain (p&lt;0.001), feed intake (p = 0.007), feed efficiency (p&lt;0.001), tibia weight (p = 0.002), length (p&lt;0.001), breaking-strength (p = 0.012), ash (p&lt;0.001), Ca (p&lt;0.001), and P content (p = 0.004). Dietary 1α-OH D3 enhanced breast meat yellowness (p = 0.015) and the length and weight of the small intestine of the broilers. Moreover, 1α-OH D3 decreased serum Ca concentration (p = 0.074) and breast meat redness (p = 0.010). These results indicate that the 1α-OH D3 improves growth, tibia quality, and meat color in broilers fed Ca- and P-deficient corn-soybean meal diets. </str>

      <str>Thrombin is a serine protease responsible for blood coagulation. Since thrombin inhibitors appear to be effective in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic and embolic disorders, considerable attention has been focused on the structure and interactions of this enzyme. In this work, to evaluate the relative free energies of hydration and binding to thrombin for some benzamidine derivatives, we used the finite difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI) algorithm within the Discover program of MSI. By this method, two possible orders of hydration for the candidates were obtained: p-amidinophenylpyruvate &gt; p-(2-oxo-1-propyl)benzamidine &gt; p-methylbenzamidine &gt; p-ethylbenzamidine &gt; p-(1-propyl)benzamidine &gt; benzamidine and p-amidinophenylpyruvate &gt; p-(2-oxo-1-propyl)benzamidine &gt; p-methylbenzamidine &gt; p-ethylbenzamidine &gt; benzamidine &gt; p-(1-propyl)benzamidine.

      <str>Prolonged, exhaustive exercise frequently leads to an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) which is linked to transient immunodepression. We investigated potential biochemical markers of stress and fatigue, and URTI symptoms as a surrogate of immunodepression, in US Marines undergoing intensive winter training at altitude. Selected plasma amino acids and leptin (p[Lep]) were measured as possible markers of fatigue and immunodepression, together with nonesterified fatty acids (p[NEFA]) and total antioxidant capacity (p[TAC]). Changes were observed in plasma free tryptophan (p[FT]), p[Gln], p[Lep], p[NEFA], p[TAC] but not branched chain amino acids (p[BCAA]). p[FT] decreased markedly. Resting p[Gln] decreased overall after one month at altitude. p[Gln] routinely decreases 1-2 hrs after prolonged exercise. Importantly, we observed early morning decreases in p[Gln], suggesting a cumulative effect of prolonged activity, stress, and fatigue. Concomitantly, individuals with highest illness scores had the greatest p[Gln] decrease: low p[Gln] may therefore be associated with a diminished stress tolerance.</str>

The C5 protein and P. horikoshii RNase P proteins were unable to activate non-congnate RNase P RNAs, P. horikoshii RNase P RNA (PhopRNA) and E. coli RNase P RNA (M1 RNA) respectively. Two chimeric RNAs, in which functional C- and S-domains of M1 RNA and PhopRNA were exchanged, were prepared and characterized with respect to the cleavage of P. horikoshii pre-tRNA(Tyr) in the presence of C5 or P. horikoshii proteins. The results suggest that PhoPop5 and PhoRpp30 function equivalently to the C5 protein in the E. coli RNase P, being involved in activation of the PhopRNA C-domain. On the other hand, PhoRpp21 and PhoRpp29 are implicated in stabilization of the PhopRNA S-domain.</str>

      <str>Due to long-term positive P-balances many surface soils in areas with high livestock density in Germany are oversupplied with available P, creating a potential for vertical P losses by leaching. In extensive studies to characterize the endangering of ground water to P pollution by chemical soil parameters it is shown that the available P content and the P concentration of the soil solution in the deeper soil layers, as indicators of the P-leaching potential, cannot be satisfactorily predicted from the available P content of the topsoils. The P equilibrium concentration in the soil solution directly above ground water table or the pipe drainage system highly depends on the relative saturation of the P-sorption capacity in this layer. A saturation index of &lt;20% normally corresponds with P equilibrium concentrations of &lt;0.2 mg P/L.

      <str>A molecular phylogeny of 15 (out of 26 recognized) species of Parablennius Miranda Ribeiro, 1915 was constructed based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments, and using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. The closely related genera Hypleurochilus, Salaria and Scartella were also studied to ascertain their relationship with Parablennius. Phylogenetic analyses were compared with morphology-based taxonomical studies. Hypleurochilus, Salaria and Scartella appear well supported within a clade including all Parablennius, indicating that this genus is paraphyletic. The species pairs P. parvicornis-P. sanguinolentus and P. gattorugine-P. ruber are well-supported and relatively distant from remaining Parablennius. Remaining Parablennius form two distinct well-supported groups: (1) a clade of Atlantic-Mediterranean Parablennius (P. pilicornis, P. marmoreus, P. rouxi, P. salensis and P. tentacularis); (2) a clade including Hypleurochilus, the Indo-Western Pacific Parablennius (P. cornutus, P. intermedius, P. tasmanianus and P. yatabei) and the Atlantic-Mediterranean P. incognitus and P. zvonimiri.

Western-blot analysis of liver microsomes with antibodies to P-448-H, P-450 male and P-450 PB-1 which corresponded to P-450d, P-450h and P-450 PCN, respectively, showed that the amount of P-450 PB-1 was decreased more markedly by lipid peroxidation as compared to those of P-450 male and P-448-H.

In diet 2 (1.6% P), 63.5% of P was derived from neutral monobasic/dibasic salts, and the remainder from other organic ingredients of the food. The P intake was nearly the same with both diets, but there was a significant (P less than 0.05) difference between diets in the percentage of ingested P that was excreted in the urine (14.7 +/- 5.3% for diet 1; 34.9 +/- 8.4% for diet 2), and in 6-day urinary P excretion (774 +/- 290 mg for diet 1; 2,004 +/- 556 mg for diet 2). The P concentrations in urine samples obtained by cystocentesis after cats ate were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher when cats were fed diet 2 than when those same cats were fed diet 1. Plasma P concentrations increased after ingestion of diet 2, but were unchanged after ingestion of diet 1. Seemingly, urinary excretion of P was markedly influenced by dietary composition.

      <str>Phosphorus (P) is present in different chemical compounds in animal feeds, and the solubility and digestibility of these different compounds are known to differ significantly. Animal protein ingredients generally have a high P content and are major contributors to total P of feeds for fish and other domestic animals. Estimation of different P compounds in these ingredients could help to improve the accuracy of estimates of digestible P contents of feeds. Bone P and organic P contents were quantified in 32 animal protein ingredients, including 10 fish meals, 14 meat and bone meals, and 8 poultry byproducts meals, using a fractionation protocol. The total P contents of the ingredients ranged from 2.1 to 8.3% on a dry matter (DM) basis. Organic P contents varied between 0.3 and 1.3% of DM. Highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) linear relationships were observed between total P and ash and between bone P and ash for all ingredients combined: total P (%) = 0.185 x ash (%) (R (2) = 0.88), and bone P (%) = 0.188 x ash (%) - 0.852 (R (2) = 0.94). These results suggest that bone P can be easily and reliably estimated on the basis of ash content in animal protein ingredients.</str>

      <str>Platelets in stirred whole blood can be induced to form aggregates and also to form heterotypic platelet-monocyte (P/M) and platelet-neutrophil (P/N) conjugates. Here we have investigated the effects of three GPIIb-IIIa antagonists (GR144053F, MK-852 and Reopro, a CD62P-blocking antibody, GA6, and EDTA on the conjugate formation that occurs on stirring whole blood and in response to adding ADP and PAF. We have confirmed the identities of the conjugates by light microscopy after cell sorting. Platelet aggregation was measured by platelet counting. Monocytes, neutrophils, P/M and P/N were detected and quantitated using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Stirring whole blood resulted in both platelet aggregation and formation of P/M but not P/N. Adding ADP or PAF to whole blood caused rapid platelet aggregation and generation of both P/M and P/N. All of the GPIIb-IIIa antagonists studied had similar effects: inhibition of stirring-induced platelet aggregation and P/M formation, and inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation and P/N formation. In contrast, they accelerated ADP induced-P/M conjugate formation and PAF-induced formation of both P/M and P/N. Both EDTA and GA6 completely inhibited P/M and P/N, which is commensurate with CD62P being involved in platelet-leucocyte conjugate formation. The results of these investigations suggest that GPIIb-IIIa has a dual role in determining the interaction between platelets and leukocytes.</str>

      <str>Cytochrome P-450, designated as P-450-MK2, was purified to an electrophoretic homogeneity from polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-treated female crab-eating monkeys. P-450-MK2 catalyzed nifedipine and nilvadipine oxidations, at a rate comparable to human P-450-HM1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of P-450-MK2 was highly homologous to those of P-450-HM1 and NF 25. The antibodies to P-450-HM1 recognized P-450-MK2 and effectively inhibited the activity of testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase in monkey liver microsomes. These results suggest that a form of cytochrome P-450 corresponding to human P-450-HM1 or P-450NF which belongs to the P450 III gene family is also present in liver microsomes of crab-eating monkeys.</str>

A qualitative reduction (P = 0.05) of the IgE responses to Dp and Der p 2 was observed from t1 to t4, but a highly statistical significant decrease appeared at t3 (P &lt; 0.01). With regard to Der p 1 IgE values, the immunotherapy induced a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.01) at t3, but not before. In group A, the IgE responses to Der p 1 and Der p 2 were not correlated at t0 (rs = 0.31; P = 0.21) but were correlated at t3 (rs = 0.78; P = 0.001). We also examined sera from 14 adult patients (group B, same SIT schedule as group A) who were without respiratory symptoms at the end of the third year (t3) of Dp SIT.

      <str>Typical sediments from Taihu Lake, a meso-to-hypereutrophic lake, were collected and examined on the basis of P-fractionation by sequential extraction scheme. Sedimentary inorganic phosphorus were fractioned into four forms and the rank order according to the mean concentration of P-fractions in Taihu Lake was NaOH-P &gt; BD-P &gt; HCI-P &gt; NH4Cl-P. The concentrations of BD-P were linearly correlated with the content of active Fe (R2 = 0.96). Also, the linear relationship between the sum of BD-P and NaOH-P and the sum of active Fe and active Al content was observed within the six sediments investigated (R2 = 0.96). Moreover, the bio-available phosphorus (BAP) content was estimated by the sum of NH4 Cl-P, BD-P, and NaOH-P, viz. BAP = NH4 Cl-P + NaOH-P + BD-P. In Taihu Lake, the BAP contents are ranging from 0.10 mg/g dw to 1.25 mg/g dw, and average 0.40 mg/g dw for all sediment samples. The relative contributions of BAP to total sedimentary phosphorus (TP) and inorganic sedimentary phosphorus (IP) range from 18.67% to 50.79% (33.61% on average) and from 52.82% to 82.09% (67.81% on average), respectively.</str>

No new polymorphs could be obtained by conventional polymorph screening based on different solvents and different crystallization conditions. Formation of a new polymorph of p-MeBA named p-MeBA I, isomorphous with the crystal of p-ClBA, was induced by hetero-seeding with a small quantity of powdered p-ClBA added to a supersaturated solution of p-MeBA in hexane, while seeding of p-ClBA with p-MeBA II failed to give a new phase of p-ClBA isomorphous with known crystalline p-MeBA II. Mixed crystals of p-MeBA and p-ClBA were also prepared with different p-MeBA/p-ClBA ratios to understand the role of the different functional groups in the crystal structure. Crystal phases were characterized by combined use of single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.</str>

      <str>We used the isolated perfused rat kidney to evaluate the role of renal decarboxylation of p-tyrosine as the source of urinary p-tyramine. Kidneys were perfused with concentrations of p-tyrosine ranging from 0.02 mM to 2.0 mM. p-Tyramine was measured by a sensitive and specific radioenzymatic assay. An increase in the perfusate concentration of p-tyrosine resulted in a significant increase in p-tyramine production that was blocked by the addition of NSD-1015, an inhibitor of aromatic-1-amino decarboxylase (AADC). We conclude p-tyrosine is the precursor for the renal production of p-tyramine, renal AADC catalyzes the formation of urinary p-tyramine, synthesized p-tyramine is predominantly excreted in the urine, and p-tyramine synthesis is modulated by the arterial delivery of p-tyrosine to the kidney.</str>

      <str>The importance of subsoil features for phosphorus (P) leaching is frequently mentioned, but subsoil effects are still poorly documented. This study examined whether the subsoil of four agricultural Swedish soils (two sand and two clay) functioned as a source or sink for P leaching by measuring P leaching from intact soil columns with topsoil (1.05 m deep) and without topsoil (0.77 m deep) over 3 yr. One sandy soil with high topsoil P content (Olsen P, 84 mg kg) and high subsoil sorption capacity (P sorption index [PSI], 3.7 mmol kg) had low leaching of dissolved reactive P (DRP) from full-length and subsoil lysimeters (0.12 and 0.08 kg ha yr, respectively). The other sandy soil, with high Olsen P content in the topsoil and subsoil (27 and 19 mg kg, respectively) and low PSI in the subsoil (1.4 mmol kg), had high DRP leaching from full-length and subsoil lysimeters (3.33 and 3.29 kg ha yr, respectively). High P content at depth (Olsen P, 21 mg kg) in one clay soil resulted in relatively higher subsoil DRP contribution (89%) to total leaching than observed in the other clay soil (71%). These results indicate that the subsoil can act as source or sink for P leaching, depending on P content, degree of P saturation, and P sorption capacity, and therefore subsoil properties should be considered when selecting mitigation measures to reduce P leaching. </str>

      <str>Multidrug resistance (MDR) of neoplastic tissue represents a real obstacle to the effective chemotherapy of cancer. Several mechanisms of MDR were identified, from which the over-expression and efflux activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) - a plasma membrane ATPase (ABCB1 member of ABC transporter family) - represents the most commonly observed reason for neoplastic disease chemotherapy malfunction. The process of P-gp-mediated MDR seems to be related to intracellular calcium homeostasis, at least indirectly, for the following reasons: i. substances blocking calcium influx through L-type of calcium channels like verapamil were often found to antagonize P-gp-mediated MDR; ii. calcium signal abnormalities were observed in cells over-expressing P-gp; iii. cells with P-gp-mediated MDR were often resistant to thapsigargin; iv. several differences in intracellular calcium localization were observed when P-gp-negative and P-gp-positive cells were compared; and v. differences in the contents of several proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum involved in calcium homeostasis were observed to be associated with P-gp over-expression. This current study represents an attempt to summarize the knowledge about the possible relationship between P-gp-mediated MRD and intracellular calcium homeostasis.</str>

The phenotypic identification of 173 isolates was completed by molecular methods. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP PCR) analysis was used to determine the genetic similarity of intraindividual P. intermedia/P. nigrescens group isolates recovered from 12 subjects. All 19 P. gingivalis isolates (16 intraabdominal isolates and three odontogenic isolates) hybridized with the P. gingivalis-specific DNA probe. Of the 154 P. intermedia/ P. nigrescens group isolates, 74 were identified as P. intermedia; 78, as P. nigrescens; and 2, as P intermedia/P. nigrescens-like isolates. P. intermedia and P. nigrescens were isolated with equal frequency from patients with all other infections except those with bacteremia, from whom only P. nigrescens isolates were recovered. There were 12 cases in which multiple P. intermedia/ P. nigrescens group isolates were recovered; in nine, only one of the species was isolated, whereas in three, two different species were detected. The intraindividual isolates representing the same species always exhibited identical AP PCR genotypes.</str>

In the rat, a large fraction (approximately 0.5) of d-amphetamine is biotransformed to p-hydroxyamphetamine. However, the rate of biotransformation to p-hydroxyamphetamine (approximately 0.0099 . min-1) is slow compared to the rate of elimination of p-hydroxyamphetamine (0.049 . min-1). As a result, plasma levels of d-amphetamine exceed those of p-hydroxyamphetamine. The kinetic data suggest that: 1) p-hydroxyamphetamine plays little role in immediate responses to single injections of d-amphetamine; 2) p-hydroxyamphetamine is not involved in tachyphylactic responses to repeated injections of d-amphetamine; and 3) p-hydroxynorephedrine plays no role in immediate or tachyphylactic responses to d-amphetamine.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) bioavailability depends on its concentration and speciation in solution. Andisols and Oxisols have very low soil solution concentration of free orthophosphate, as they contain high concentrations of strongly P-sorbing minerals (Al/Fe oxyhydroxides, allophanes). Free orthophosphate is the form of P taken up by plants, but it is not the only P species present in the soil solution. Natural colloidal P (P associated with Al, Fe, and organic matter of sizes ranging from 1 to 1000 nm) constitutes an important fraction of soil solution P in these soils; however, its availability has not been considered. We measured the uptake of P by wheat (Triticum aestivum) from radiolabeled nonfiltered (colloid-containing) and 3-kDa filtered (nearly colloid-free) soil-water extracts from Andisols and Oxisols. In the Andisol extracts, P uptake was up to 5-fold higher from the nonfiltered solutions than the corresponding 3-kDa filtered solutions. In the Oxisol extract, no difference in P uptake between both solutions was observed. Also the diffusional flux of P as measured with the DGT technique was larger in the nonfiltered than in the 3-kDa filtered solutions. Our results suggest that colloidal P from Andisols is not chemically inert and contributes to plant uptake of P. </str>

      <str>Despite the vast number of risk factors that apparently predispose to the development of osteoporosis (OP), they have not been accurately identified and given relative priority. In order to analyse possible risk factors prospectively in a local patient population with overt OP (histomorphometrically confirmed and characterised) and compare it with an appropriately matched non-OP control group (with normal bone mass on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), a detailed general history, risk factor analysis, dietary history and anthropometric data were obtained from 56 OP and 125 non-OP subjects. In females a positive family history of OP (P = 0.002), a fair complexion (P = 0.009), lower body mass (P = 0.02) and height (P = 0.03), no breast-feeding of babies (P = 0.006), a history of smoking (P = 0.001) and fat distribution around the waist (P = 0.009) were identified as risk factors. In males lack of exercise (P = 0.008), a history of smoking (P = 0.01), lower body mass (P = 0.04) and height (P = 0.04), a preference for salty food (P = 0.02) and fat distribution around the waist (P = 0.002) appeared to predispose. Dietary calcium, phosphorus, protein and caffeine intakes were similar in OP and control subjects, but alcohol consumption was clearly higher in both OP males (P = 0.001) and females (P = 0.01).</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that can cause multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells by acting as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump. The regulatory effects of the small GTPases Rab5 and RalA on the intracellular trafficking of P-gp were investigated in HeLa cells. As expected, overexpressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged P-gp (P-gp-EGFP) is mainly localised to the plasma membrane. However, upon cotransfection of either dominant negative Rab5 (Rab5-S34N) or constitutively active RalA (RalA-G23V) the intracellular P-gp-EGFP levels increased approximately 9 and 13 fold, respectively, compared to control P-gp-EGFP cells. These results suggest that Rab5 and RalA regulate P-gp trafficking between the plasma membrane and an intracellular compartment. In contrast, coexpression of constitutively active Rab5 (Rab5-Q79L) or dominant negative RalA (RalA-S28N) had no effect on the localisation of P-gp-EGFP. Furthermore, the intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin, a substrate for P-gp, increased significantly with an increased intracellular localisation of P-gp-EGFP. These results imply that it may be possible to overcome MDR by controlling the plasma membrane localisation of P-gp.</str>

      <str>The role of sediment-bound organic phosphorus (Po) on lake eutrophication was studied using sequential extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis by collecting sediments from Dianchi Lake, China. Bioavailable Po species including labile monoester P, diester P, and phytate-like P were identified in the sequential extractions by H2O, NaHCO3, and NaOH. For the H2O-Po, 36.7% (average) was labile monoester P, 14.8% was diester P, and 69.9% was phytate-like P. In NaHCO3-Po, 19.9% was labile monoester P, 17.5% was diester P, and 58.8% was phytate-like P. For NaOH-Po, 25.6% was labile monoester P, 7.9% was diester P, and 35.9% was phytate-like P. Labile monoester P was active to support growth of algae to form blooms. Diester P mainly distributed in labile H2O and NaHCO3 fractions was readily available to cyanobacteria. Phytate-like P represents a major portion of the Po in the NaOH fractions, also in the more labile H2O and NaHCO3 fractions. Based on results of sequential extraction of Po and enzymatic hydrolysis, lability and bioavailability was in decreasing order as follows: H2O-Po &gt; NaHCO3-Po &gt; NaOH-Po, and bioavailable Po accounted for only 12.1-27.2% of total Po in sediments. These results suggest that the biogeochemical cycle of bioavailable Po might play an important role in maintaining the eutrophic status of lakes. </str>

      <str>Organic phosphorus (OP) species in sediments of the Baiyangdian Lake in China was investigated via fractionation and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance ((31)P NMR) spectroscopy. Results of chemical fractionation showed that different OP fractions ranked in the order: humic acid-P &gt; HCl-OP &gt; fulvic acid-P ≈ NaHCO(3)-OP &gt; residual OP. Labile OP and moderately labile OP, which can be degraded for phytoplankton uptake, contributed to 58.7-68.5% of total extracted OP, indicative of the potential P release from sediments in the lake. (31)P NMR spectroscopy results suggested the rank order of P species present in the NaOH-EDTA extractant of the sediments: orthophosphate &gt; monoester-P &gt; DNA-P &gt; pyrophosphate-P. Phytate, polyphosphates, and phosphonates, which appeared in sediments of some deeper lakes, were not detected in the shallow lake. Significant correlations were identified between total P (TP) in water column and sediment TP, monoester-P and DNA-P, positively indicating that sediment P species, especially OP components, should probably contribute to the contents of P in water column and further to the lake eutrophication.</str>

Chromatographic separation was carried out on Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 using gradient elution with a H2 O (pH 2.5, adjusted with CF3 COOH) and MeCN mixture at 30°. The contents of analyzed phenolic compounds (% of the dry weight of the leaves, dw) varied among examined species: rutin (max. 0.024%, P. argentea), hyperoside (max. 0.020%, P. lagopus), quercitrin (max. 0.013%, P. holosteum ssp. holosteum), quercetin (max. 0.028%, P. holosteum ssp. scopulorum), chlorogenic acid (max. 0.115%, P. lagopus), and caffeic acid (max. 0.046%, P. coronopus). Isoquercitrin was detected only in P. argentea (0.020%), while isochlorogenic acid content was below limit of quantification in all investigated species. Multivariate analyses (UPGMA and PCA) showed significant differences in contents of investigated polyphenolic compounds between different Plantago taxa. Accordingly, investigated substances might be employed as chemotaxonomic markers in the study of the complex genus Plantago. </str>

      <str>In order to discover good parameters for experimental osteoporosis, we measured the failure load of the femoral neck and the bending strength of the tibia in orchidectomized (ORC) (20 rats for 4 weeks), ovariectomized (OVX) (28 rats for 6 weeks), and immobilized (IMM) (33 rats for 3 weeks) rats. Each of these operations led to a significant decrease in trabecular bone volume when compared with corresponding controls (p &lt; 0.001). The ash weight of femurs was significantly decreased in ORC (p &lt; 0.05) and IMM (p &lt; 0.001) rats, but not in OVX rats. Growth of the femur was somewhat slower in ORC (p &lt; 0.05) and IMM rats (p &lt; 0.05), but not in OVX animals. All three osteoporosis models showed significant decreases in the maximal load of the femoral neck (ORC: 23.9%, p &lt; 0.001; OVX: 15.8%, p &lt; 0.001; IMM: 27.7%, p &lt; 0.001), as well as in energy absorption (ORC: 43.9%, p &lt; 0.001; OVX: 28.3%, p &lt; 0.001; IMM: 45.3%, p &lt; 0.001). In tibia orchidectomy reduced maximal strength and energy absorption significantly (10%, p &lt; 0.01; 27.8%, p &lt; 0.01), but ovariectomy decreased only maximal load (8.7%, p &lt; 0.01) and immobilization only energy absorption (18.0%, p &lt; 0.01). Our results suggest that the mechanical strength of the femoral neck is a sensitive indicator of bone loss in all three osteoporosis models.</str>

      <str>Blast cells obtained from 104 children with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were analysed for the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-170) and glutathione S-transfer pi (GST-pi) using immunohistochemistry. Expression of P-170 was detected in 36 of 104 patients (35%) and increased GST-pi was seen in 52 patients (50%). Coexpression of both resistance proteins was observed in 22 leukaemias (21%), whereas no evidence of the resistance markers was found in 38 cases (37%). In patients with P-170-positive leukaemic cells, a significantly lower probability of remaining in first continuous complete remission (CCR) was observed when compared with patients with P-170-negative tumours (P &lt; 0.05). However, only a trend for a more frequent expression of P-170 was found in the leukaemic cells of patients who experienced relapses (P = 0.099). Overexpression of GST-pi was correlated with a higher relapse rate (P = 0.001) and a lower probability of remaining in first CCR (P = 0.01). Expression of P-170 and GST-pi was independent of sex, FAB type, immunological subtype and initial blast cell count. The multivariate analysis indicated that only the expression of P-170 is an unfavourable prognostic factor for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in addition to the prognostic clinical factors.</str>

      <str>Flavonoids are present in fruits, vegetables and beverages derived from plants, and in many dietary supplements or herbal remedies. A number of naturally occurring flavonoids have been shown to modulate the CYP450 system, including the induction or inhibition of these enzymes. This review focuses on the flavonoid effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP1, 2E1, 3A4 and 19. Flavonoids alter CYPs by various mechanisms, including the stimulation of gene expression via specific receptors and/or CYP protein, or mRNA stabilization and so on. But in vivo and in vitro, the effects of flavonoids are not always coincident as a result of concentrations of flavonoids, genetic and environmental factors. As well, flavonoids may interact with drugs through the induction or inhibition of their metabolism. Much attention should be paid to the metabolism interaction of the flavonoids when coadministered with other drugs.</str>

      <str>von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin are established plasma markers of endothelial cell dysfunction, whilst beta thromboglobulin is an established plasma marker of platelet activity. Soluble P-selectin may be the product of either or both types of cell and levels of all four molecules have been previously found to be increased in atherosclerosis. To determine the relationship of soluble P-selectin to the endothelial cell and platelet products, we measured the four indices in a case control study of 55 patients with peripheral vascular disease and 55 age and sex matched controls. von Willebrand factor (p &lt; 0.0001), beta thromboglobulin (p = 0.0006), soluble P-selectin (p = 0.0021) and soluble thrombomodulin (p = 0.021) were all raised in the patients. Soluble P-selectin correlated with beta thromboglobulin (r = 0.34, p = 0.019) but failed to correlate with either endothelial cell marker. Co-culture of endothelial cells in vitro with bovine thrombin resulted in increased levels of von Willebrand factor in the supernatants but levels of soluble thrombomodulin and soluble P-selectin were not enhanced. Exposure of endothelial cell monolayers to elastase resulted in different patterns of release of von Willebrand factor, soluble thrombomodulin and soluble P-selectin. We suggest that soluble P-selectin is unlikely to arise from the endothelium and may be a new marker of platelet activation in atherosclerosis.</str>

      <str>Phytophthora alni subsp. alni, P. alni subsp. multiformis, and P. alni subsp. uniformis are responsible for alder disease in Europe. Class I and II elicitin gene patterns of P. alni subsp. alni, P. alni subsp. multiformis, P. alni subsp. uniformis, and the phylogenetically close species P. cambivora and P. fragariae were studied through mRNA sequencing and 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-specific PCRs and sequencing. The occurrence of multiple 3'UTR sequences in association with identical elicitin-encoding sequences in P. alni subsp. alni indicated duplication/recombination events. The mRNA pattern displayed by P. alni subsp. alni demonstrated that elicitin genes from all the parental genomes are actually expressed in this allopolyploid taxon. The complementary elicitin patterns resolved confirmed the possible involvement of P. alni subsp. multiformis and P. alni subsp. uniformis in the genesis of the hybrid species P. alni subsp. alni. The occurrence of multiple and common elicitin gene sequences throughout P. cambivora, P. fragariae, and P. alni sensu lato, not observed in other Phytophthora species, suggests that duplication of these genes occurred before the radiation of these species.</str>

      <str>BALB/c mice are about 2,000 times less susceptible to sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei than to Plasmodium yoelii. Associated with this is the innate cellular response mounted after injection with P. berghei. Host inflammatory cells do not normally attack P. yoelii during their development as exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) in the liver. We used P. berghei sporozoites to induce host inflammation that might act against developing P. yoelii EEFs. Mice injected with P. berghei sporozoites followed 1 hr later with P. yoelii had a 58% reduction in P. yoelii EEFs. To establish whether this was due to events that occurred before vs. after invasion of hepatocytes by P. yoelii sporozoites, mice received P. yoelii sporozoites that were allowed to invade for 1 hr before subsequent injection with P. berghei; these mice showed minimal reduction in P. yoelii EEFs. Thus, most of the deleterious effects of P. berghei sporozoites appear to have been directed against P. yoelii sporozoites prior to their invasion of hepatocytes. Plasmodium yoelii that had already invaded were relatively unaffected. Further timing experiments showed that this effect was induced only by viable P. berghei sporozoites, which may thus induce rapid changes in sinusoid physiology leading to host resistance against P. yoelii sporozoites.</str>

      <str>Oral pretreatment with diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and carbon disulfide (CS2) prevented mice from methemoglobinemia induced by phenacetin. This treatment resulted in marked elevation of plasma p-phenetidine concentrations, prolongation of phenacetin levels, and lowering of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol and p-aminophenol levels. Both DTC and CS2 also suppressed p-phenetidine-induced methemoglobinemia with a delay in plasma p-phenetidine disappearance. In vitro, methemoglobin formation by p-phenetidine was decreased in liver microsomes isolated from DTC- or CS2-treated mice. The liver microsomal phenacetin and p-phenetidine O-deethylation activities and p-phenetidine N-hydroxylation activity decreased 1 h after administration of DTC or CS2, whereas deacetylation of phenacetin and N-acetyl-p-aminophenol by microsomes and acetylation of p-phenetidine by a soluble fraction from a liver homogenate were scarcely affected. The suppression of methemoglobinemia by DTC and CS2 may result from an inhibition of metabolic conversion of p-phenetidine to methemoglobin-forming substances such as N-hydroxy-p-phenetidine which is of most importance, p-aminophenol and 2-hydroxy-p-phenetidine by the microsomal cytochrome P-450-containing monooxygenase system in the liver.</str>

      <str>Accumulating evidence indicates that there is a multiplicity of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in plants. These monooxygenases are implicated in the metabolism of sterols, terpenes, gibberellins, isoflavonoids, and xenobiotics. Evidence that cytochromes P-450 are involved in the detoxification of herbicides (chlorotoluron, primsulfuron, and diclofop) includes photoreversible CO inhibition of the reactions, and a requirement for O(2) and NADPH. Several cytochromes P-450, M(r) 45,000 to 65,000, have been isolated, including hydroxylases of cinnamic acid, 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan, and digitoxin. In some cases the purified cytochrome P-450 has been successfully reconstituted with NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase (M(r) 72,000-84,000 protein). This reductase appears to be a nonspecific electron donor to different forms of cytochrome P-450. Immunological techniques and specific inhibitors (triazoles, imidazole derivatives) are being used to characterize plant cytochromes P-450 and the NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase. Specific cytochromes P-450 are induced by wounding or pathogens, others are expressed in specific cell types. Plant cytochromes P-450 are found in various subcellular locations, including endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membranes, glyoxysomes, and perhaps mitochondria. A cytochrome P-450 demethylase from avocado has recently been sequenced and found to have a hydrophobic N terminus similar to the membrane anchor of cytochromes P-450 from other organisms. The existence of cytochromes P-450 in different subcellular locations suggests that there are many genes for cytochromes P-450 in plants which have yet to be identified and classified.</str>

      <str>Induction of the monooxygenase system of xenobiotic metabolism by means of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was studied in rat liver microsomes as compared with induction using phenobarbital (PB) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). HCB was shown to increase the content of cytochrome P-450 as well as aminopyrine- and benzphetamine-N-demethylase activities in liver microsomes. At the same time, HCB increased the benzpyrene hydroxylase activity as it was the case in induction with 3-MC. Electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed that HCB, as phenobarbital does, induced appearance of the protein with a molecular mass 52,000 (cytochrome P-450) but not of the protein of molecular mass 56,000, which is the main isozyme of cytochrome P-450 in 3-MC microsomes (P-448). Except of cytochrome P-450, cytochrome, immunologically similar to cytochrome-P-448 from 3-MC microsomes, constituted 10% of the total content of cytochrome in HCB microsomes as shown by rocket immunoelectrophoresis using monospecific antibodies towards individual cytochromes P-448 and P-450 (anti-P-448 and anti-P-450). Anti-P-450 and especially anti-P-448 inhibited benzpyrene hydroxylase in HCB microsomes. HCB appears to be an inductor of a "mixed" type.</str>

      <str>A ribonuclease P-like activity was partially purified from HeLa cell mitochondria by DEAE-cellulose and octyl-Sepharose chromatography. RNase P-like activity can be quantitatively recovered from intact mitochondrial preparations treated with micrococcal nuclease, strongly suggesting that the enzyme is localized within the organelles. Mitochondrial RNase P (mtRNase P) cleaves the precursor to Escherichia coli suppressor tRNATyr at the same site as E. coli RNase P, producing the mature 5'-end of tRNATyr. The sensitivity of mtRNase P to pretreatment with nucleases or Pronase indicates that the enzyme has essential RNA and protein components. Although the ionic requirements of mtRNase P are similar to those of the RNase P activity isolated from the post-mitochondrial cytosol fraction, the chromatographic properties of mtRNase P are distinct. Mitochondrial RNase P is probably a part of the mitochondrial RNA processing machinery of mammalian mitochondria, being responsible for the endonucleolytic cleavage of the RNA transcripts at the 5'-side of the tRNA sequences.</str>

      <str>Phospho-sulindac (P-S, OXT-328), a novel sulindac derivative, has shown superior anticancer efficacy and safety compared to sulindac. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of topical P-S hydrogel in the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer in preclinical models. P-S is a potent inhibitor of A431 epidermoid carcinoma in vitro and achieves this effect by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. The anticancer efficacy of topical and oral P-S was further evaluated in mice bearing A431 intradermal xenografts. Compared to the controls, topical P-S hydrogel inhibited the A431 xenografts by 70.5% (p&lt;0.01), while oral P-S inhibited it by 43.4% (p&lt;0.05), being significantly less effective than topical P-S (p=0.017). Topical P-S hydrogel generated significant levels (&gt;500 nmol/g tumor tissue) of intact P-S in the tumors, accounting for 92.5% of the total metabolites in the A431 xenografts. This local delivery of high levels of intact P-S to the A431 xenografts is an important contributor to the potent activity of topical P-S and no local or systemic side effects were noted in the treatment group. Thus, topical P-S is a promising treatment modality against non-melanoma skin cancer and merits further evaluation.</str>

      <str>A method for measuring the content of two groups of microsomal cytochrome P-450 isozymes--cytochromes P-450W and P-450L--with the active sites directed into the water phase and membrane lipids, respectively, has been developed. The method is based on the ability of the xanthine oxidase-menadione complex to reduce microsomal cytochromes b5 and P-450 under anaerobic conditions by transferring electrons to hemoproteins with the active sites directed into the water phase. Cytochrome b5 is completely reduced (to the dithionite level) and cytochrome P-450 is reduced partially (only a group of cytochromes P-450W). The amount of cytochromes P-450L is estimated using the difference between the total content of cytochrome P-450 reduced by sodium dithionite and the content of cytochromes P-450W. The possibility of controlling the ratio of these two isozyme groups in cytochrome P-450 in vivo in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum by pretreatment of animals with a variety of chemicals has been demonstrated. The ratio of cytochromes P-450W and P-450L has been shown to decrease two-fold 18 days after three injections of phenobarbital into mice. Carbon tetrachloride and cyclophosphamide also decrease this ratio in vivo.</str>

      <str>Electrochemical oxidation of some p-substituted phenols (p-nitrophenol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phenol, p-cresol, and p-methoxyphenol) with electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents was studied to reveal the relationship between the structure and the electrochemical reactivity of p-substituted phenols using a boron-doped diamond electrode by voltammetry and bulk electrolysis. Voltammetric study shows that the oxidation peak potentials of p-substituted phenols become more positive with an increase of Hammett's constants, that is, the direct electrochemical oxidation of p-substituted phenol with an electron-withdrawing group is more difficult than that of p-substituted phenol with an electron-donating group. However,the p-substituted phenols with electron-withdrawing groups are degraded faster than those with electron-donating groups in bulk electrolysis, which is opposite to the result obtained on the Pt electrode. These results indicate that the p-substituted phenols are mainly degraded by indirect electrochemical oxidation with hydroxyl radicals on a boron-doped diamond electrode. Under the attack of hydroxyl radicals, the release of p-substituted groups from the aromatic ring is the rate-limiting step. Since electron-withdrawing groups are easy to be released, the p-substituted phenols with these groups are degraded faster than those with electron-donating groups. Therefore, the degradation rates of the p-substituted phenols rise with an increase of Hammett's constants.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux pump, is a membrane transporter that influences the absorption and excretion of drugs. There is a striking overlap between the substrates for CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. This study was designed to assess whether udenafil, a substrate of CYP3A4, is also a P-glycoprotein substrate. Udenafil stimulated P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, a putative measure of P-glycoprotein affinity, although with lower affinity than a proven substrate, verapamil. Bidirectional transport studies of udenafil using Caco-2 cell monolayers showed that its efflux (15.9-22.8 x 10(-6) cm/s) was significantly higher than its influx (3.7-9.1 x 10(-6) cm/s). P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tariquidar and verapamil significantly increased the influx of udenafil and decreased the efflux of udenafil. These results indicate that udenafil is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. The low bioavailability, variable absorption and drug-drug interactions of udenafil may be related to the variability of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein expression and to possible CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein interactions.</str>

      <str>Anophelines collected indoors and in the peri-domiciliary area in 3 localities in the Amazon region, state of Acre, Brazil, from August 1990 to January 1991 were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific monoclonal antibodies directed against the repeats of the circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. vivax V247, and P. malariae. Of the 3056 specimens collected, 2610 were Anopheles oswaldoi, 362 A. deaneorum, 60 A. triannulatus and 24 were A. darlingi. The infection rates of A. oswaldoi were 3.41% for P. falciparum, 2.26% for P. vivax, 1.22 for P. vivax VK247, and 0.42% for P. malariae. For A. deaneorum, the infection rates were 2.76% for P. falciparum, 0.55% for P. vivax, and 0.82% for P. vivax VK247. All samples of the other 2 species collected (A. triannulatus and A. darlingi) were negative in the ELISA. There were certain differences in the anopheline distribution and infection rates between these localities, and in one only A. oswaldoi was found to be infected. These results strongly point to A. oswaldoi as the main malaria vector in the region. No difference was found between the potential vectors of P. vivax and P. vivax VK247. The significance of these findings for malaria control is discussed.</str>

      <str>Between 1976 and 1983, 1,783 colorectal cancers were diagnosed among the Cote-d'Or residents; of these 44 (2.5 p. 100) were under age 45. Cancer developed more often on familial polyposis (11.4 p. 100), ulcerative colitis (2.3 p. 100) or in the Lynch cancer family syndrome (4.6 p. 100) before 45 than in older patients: 0.2 p. 100 (p less than 0.01), 0.2 p. 100 (NS) and 0 p. 100 (p less than 0.01) respectively. There was no significant difference between young and older patients concerning the site, the histologic type or the stage of diagnosis. Curative resection rates were similar before age 45 (68.2 p. 100) as after that age (61.8 p. 100). Operative mortality was lower in younger (3.3 p. 100) than in older patients (12.6 p. 100; NS). After surgery for cure (operative mortality excluded) the 5-year corrected survival rates were similar in the two age groups: 69.4 +/- 8.8 p. 100 and 64.0 +/- 1.8 p. 100 respectively (NS). These data suggest that with the exception of predisposing diseases there is no important difference between young and older patients with regard to the anatomoclinical and evolutive aspects of colorectal cancers.</str>

      <str>Progesterone (P) is a mineralocorticoid (MC)-antagonist in vitro. During pregnancy, plasma P concentrations exceed aldosterone concentrations at least 50-fold, but plasma aldosterone increases only 4-8-fold in a compensatory manner. Since the in vivo anti-MC activity of P seems to be only moderate, we hypothesized that P is metabolized by enzymes of MC target tissue similar to the way cortisol is metabolized by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) type 2 in order to protect the MC receptor. We, therefore, examined P metabolism using 4-(14)C-P in subcellular fractions of human postmenopausal and male kidneys, and in homogenates of one premenopausal kidney. We found that P is converted effectively, even at high P concentrations (10(-6) mol/l), to various metabolites: 20alpha-dihydro(DH)-P; 17alpha-OH-P; 17alpha-OH,20alpha-DH-P; 5alpha-DH-P; 3beta,5alpha-tetrahydro(TH)-P; and 20alpha-DH,5alpha-DH-P. Homogenates of premenopausal kidney also showed conversion to 3alpha- and 5beta-reduced P metabolites. These results confirm the existence of an efficient renal enzyme system as a possible mechanism of an enzyme-mediated MC receptor selectivity.</str>

      <str>As benzo[e]pyrene (B[e]P) has been shown to enhance the carcinogenic effects of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on mouse skin [26], it therefore seemed important to determine if it would also act as a cocarcinogen in another target tissue, namely respiratory tract mucosa. Tracheal mucosa of rats was concomitantly exposed to B[a]P and B[e]P for up to 6 months. At B[a]P/B[e]P ratios of 1 : 1 and 0.5 : 1, B[e]P had no cocarcinogenic effects on tracheal epithelium. At the higher B[a]P/B[e]P ratio, B[e]P appeared to reduce the carcinoma incidence from 65% (B[a]P alone) to 40% (B[a]P plus B[e]P). In sharp contrast to the carcinoma incidence, the tracheal and peritracheal sarcoma incidence was enhanced 2-3-fold by B[e]P. Thus, while not cocarcinogenic for tracheal epithelium, B[e]P was cocarcinogenic for connective tissue. Together with other results [26], these point to the importance of the target tissue as a determining factor of cocarcinogenic activity of test substances.</str>

      <str>Intrathecal injection of substance P produced a behavioural syndrome, consisting of reciproacal hindlimb scratching and biting or fore- and hind-licking. Pretreatment with either an analogue of substance P, (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9)-substance P (DPDT-SP) or (D-Arg1, D-Pro2,4, D-Trp7,9, Leu11)-substance P, given intrathecally, reduced the response to substance P in a dose-dependent manner. The behaviour induced by substance P was also inhibited by intrathecal, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of morphine. Intrathecal or subcutaneous injection of naloxone showed a biphasic effect on substance P response; the substance P-induced nociceptive response was increased by a small dose of naloxone, while it was inversely decreased by a large dose of naloxone. The results with analogues of substance P support the hypothesis that substance P, injected intrathecally, acts directly on substance P receptors in the spinal cord. The nociceptive response induced by substance P appears to be controlled by endogenous opioids in the spinal cord.</str>

      <str>P element dysgenesis-associated male recombination in Drosophila was examined with a selective system focused upon a section of the third chromosome divided into eight recombination segments. Tests compared crossing over in the presence of none, one and two doses of P(delta 2-3)(99B), a non-mobile transposase source, in the absence of a mobilizable P element target in the genome. In the presence of the P transposase source, and without a P element target, significant male recombination occurred in genomic regions physically separated from the P(delta 2-3) site. Using two doses of P(delta 2-3) without a P element target, the male recombination rate doubled, and 90% of the crossovers occurred in the pericentric region. The distribution of recombination events, in the absence of P element targets approximates that seen in studies of radiation induced mitotic crossing over and the metaphase chromosome map. Another experiment examined the effects of one dose of P(delta 2-3) on a genome with a single P element target, P(lArB)(87C9), in the third recombination segment. Crossovers increased 58-fold in the immediate region of the P element target.</str>

Only 17,20beta,21-P was produced, in addition to 11-deoxycortisol (17,21-P), which is intermediate between 17-P and 17,20beta,21-P. Also, the 5beta-reduced forms of 17-P, 17,21-P and 17,20beta,21-P were all found. Some sulphation of 21-hydroxylated steroids was demonstrated. The ability of female G. morhua to make 17,20beta,21-P but not 17,20beta-P was confirmed by radioimmunoassay of plasma samples from spawning fish. Although small amounts of 17,20beta-P immunoreactivity were detected in a few plasma samples, this was shown, by thin-layer chromatography, to be mostly due to cross-reaction with other unidentified compounds. The evidence strongly suggests that 17,20beta,21-P is more likely than 17,20beta-P to be the maturation-inducing steroid in G. morhua.</str>

      <str>We derive a new continuous free energy formula for protein folding. We obtain the formula first by adding hydrophobic effect to a classical free energy formula for cavities in water. We then obtain the same formula by geometrically pursuing the structure that fits best the well-known global geometric features of native structures of globular proteins: 1. high density; 2. small surface area; 3. hydrophobic core; 4. forming domains for long polypeptide chains. Conformations of a protein are presented as an all atom CPK model P= union or logical sum(i=1)(N)B(x(i),r(i)) where each atom is a ball B(x(i),r(i)). All conformations satisfy generally defined steric conditions. For each conformation P of a globular protein, there is a closed thermodynamic system Omega(P) supersetP bounded by the molecular surface M(P). Both methods derive the same free energy aV(P)+bA(P)+cW(P), where a,b,c&gt;0, V(P), A(P), and W(P) are volume of Omega(P), area of M(P), and area of the hydrophobic surface W(P) subsetM(P), which quantifies hydrophobic effect.

      <str>Two Nitrification-Denitrification Biological Excess Phosphorus Removal (NDBEPR) systems have been operated for 8.5 months in order to compare their Biological Excess Phosphorus Removal (BEPR) performance. One of these systems, i.e. the University of Cape Town (UCT) system, exhibits mainly aerobic P uptake while the External Nitrification Biological Nutrient Removal Activated Sludge (ENBNRAS) system is characterised by high anoxic P uptake. It was observed that when operating with predominantly aerobic P uptake, the UCT system released more P than the ENBNRAS system, even though it had a lower anaerobic mass fraction. However, when the influent TKN/COD was high, i.e. &gt; 0.1, anoxic P uptake also occurred in the UCT system and P release dropped to lower levels than in the ENBNRAS. Accordingly, P uptake of the UCT system was 5 mg P/l influent higher than that of the ENBNRAS system, when it was predominantly aerobic, but 9 mg P/l influent lower when anoxic P uptake occurred. As a result, the UCT system achieved superior P removal when aerobic P uptake was predominant (23% higher), but when high influent TKN/COD promoted anoxic P uptake the P removal of the UCT system was poorer than that of the ENBNRAS system. This study clearly showed that anoxic P uptake is not beneficial to NDBEPR systems.</str>

      <str>Resistance to chemotherapy is a significant problem in the treatment of colorectal carcinomas. To obtain insight into the mechanism of drug resistance, the expression of P-170 glycoprotein and biotransformation enzymes that are potentially able to contribute to drug resistance were investigated in paired samples of normal mucosa and tumors from 24 patients with colorectal cancer. In the tumors, glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity and content of GST-pi and P-170 glycoprotein were increased significantly compared with normal mucosa (P less than 0.03, P less than 0.003, and P less than 0.02, respectively). In contrast, GST-alpha and -mu, present in minor amounts compared with GST-pi, were downregulated in the tumor. Cytochrome P-450(4,5,6) and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (towards 4-nitrophenol and bilirubin) levels were significantly lower in the tumors (P less than 0.0001 and P less than 0.0002, respectively). Because decreased expression of cytochrome P-450 and increased levels of GST-pi and the P-170 glycoprotein have been implicated in (multi)drug resistance, these findings strongly suggest that in colorectal tumors the inherent resistance is multifactorial. Research to overcome this resistance should therefore be directed toward a combined treatment that eliminates all of these different mechanisms.</str>

      <str>Liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 content, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, aniline 4-hydroxylase and ethylmorphine N-demethylase activities of rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, were found to be 0.16 (n = 10) nmol P-450/mg protein, 38 (n = 5) units/mg protein, 0.04 (n = 4) nmol p-aminophenol/min/mg protein and 0.174 (n = 3) nmol formaldehyde/min/mg protein, respectively. Trout liver cytochrome P-450 was solubilized by treatment of microsomes with sodium cholate. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose column yielded two distinct cytochrome P-450 fractions from solubilized microsomes. Cytochrome P-450-I was eluted with Emulgen 913-containing buffer. Application of 0.08 M KCl in Emulgen 913-containing buffer to the DEAE-cellulose column eluted cytochrome P-450-II fraction. Cytochrome P-450-I was further purified on hydroxylapatite column. CO-difference spectrum of dithionite-reduced cytochrome P-450-I gave a peak at 449 nm while the similar spectrum of cytochrome P-450-II showed a maximum absorbance at 451 nm. Monomer molecular weights of cytochrome P-450-I and cytochrome P-450-II were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and found to be 56,000 and 48,500, respectively.</str>

      <str>The taxonomic position of the Cape Parrot (Poicephalus robustus robustus) has been the focus of much debate. A number of authors suggest that the Cape Parrot should be viewed as a distinct species separate from the other two P. robustus subspecies (P. r. fuscicollis and P. r. suahelicus). These recommendations were based on morphological, ecological, and behavioural assessments. In this study we investigated the validity of these recommendations using multilocus DNA analyses. We genotyped 138 specimens from five Poicephalus species (P. cryptoxanthus, P. gulielmi, P. meyeri, P. robustus, and P. rueppellii) using 11 microsatellite loci. Additionally, two mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I gene and 16S ribosomal RNA) and one nuclear intron (intron 7 of the β-fibrinogen gene) markers were amplified and sequenced. Bayesian clustering analysis and pairwise FST analysis of microsatellite data identified P. r. robustus as genetically distinct from the other P. robustus subspecies. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses on sequence data also supported the microsatellite analyses, placing P. r. robustus in a distinct clade separate from the other P. robustus subspecies. Molecular clock analysis places the most recent common ancestor between P. r. robustus and P. r. fuscicollis / P. r. suahelicus at 2.13 to 2.67 million years ago. Our results all support previous recommendations to elevate the Cape Parrot to species level. This will facilitate better planning and implementation of international and local conservation management strategies for the Cape Parrot. </str>

      <str>To clarify the common characteristics among P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-expressing hematological malignancies and whether chemotherapies could or could not induce P-gp expression, we analyzed P-gp/MDR1 expression in tumor cells from 200 Japanese patients (104 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML); 30 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 66 with mature lymphoid malignancies). Functional P-gp expression was examined by Rhodamine-123 efflux test, and estimated with the data by RT-PCR method. In mature lymphoid malignancies, the cells of T or natural killer (NK) cell malignancies frequently expressed P-gp/MDR1. In AML, frequent P-gp/MDR1 expression was associated with the expression of CD7 or c-kit and with 8; 21 chromosomal translocation (p &lt; 0.01), which were thought to be the characteristics of the hematopoietic stem cell. Though the expression of P-gp/MDR1 was more frequent at onset than at relapse phase, the increase is thought to result from the expansion of blastic fraction expressing P-gp/MDR1. In ALL, P-gp/MDR1 expression was not frequent in B-cell precursor lineage (three of eighteen patients), but the incidence was high in CD7(+) surface CD3(-) cases (seven of the cases). These results indicate P-gp/MDR1 expression is more frequently in the tumor of T, NK cell and stem cell, reflecting the characteristics of its normal counterpart.</str>

      <str>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of hydrated Na Ca aluminosilicate (HSCAS) on P utilization of young broiler chicks. Phosphorus-deficient corn-soybean meal diets containing .36% (.134% available) P and 1% Ca were fortified with 0, .05 and .10% P provided as KH2PO4 (22.8% P) or feed-grade dicalcium phosphate (18.9% P). Diets were available ad libitum to chicks receiving 0, .50 or 1.0% HSCAS during the period 8 to 22 d posthatching. Weight of tibia ash, percentage of tibia ash and bone-breaking force were regressed on supplemental P intake to assess P utilization in the absence or presence of HSCAS. Tibia parameters (ash weight, percentage of ash and bone-breaking force) responded linearly (P less than .01) to P supplementation. Regardless of P source (KH2PO4 or dicalcium phosphate), .5% or 1.0% HSCAS had no effect (P greater than .1) on P utilization. With no supplemental P, tibia parameters also were not affected (P greater than .05) by HSCAS. Phosphorus utilization from dicalcium phosphate was estimated to be 87% as efficient as that observed for KH2PO4. The results suggest that dietary HSCAS does not impair utilization of either phytate or inorganic P.</str>

      <str>The effects of growth hormone (GH) on two constitutively expressed rat liver cytochrome P-450 (P-450) enzymes, namely P-450f (IIC7) and P-450PB1 (IIC6), have been investigated. Hypophysectomy of both male and female rats results in low expression of P-450f. Single daily injections of GH cannot restore expression of P-450f but further repress it. Continuous administration of GH, on the other hand, increases expression of P-450f to levels comparable to those of the normal male and female rat. P-450PB1 is minimally affected by hypophysectomy or GH treatment, although a weak but significant repression by continuous administration of GH can be detected. Run-on analysis shows that continuous GH treatment increases transcription of P-450f. In addition, the sequence of the 5' flanking region of this gene reveals DNA segments that might have a putative role in the transcriptional regulation of P-450f by GH.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug efflux transporter, affects the pharmacokinetics of a wide range of substrate drugs. Our previous study clearly revealed that intestinal P-gp expression levels were decreased via an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated mechanism in the early phases of diabetes. Here, we focused on changes in ileal P-gp expression and the influences of NOS on the P-gp expression levels in the later phase of diabetic condition using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The ileal P-gp expression and activity was analyzed by Western blot analysis and by in situ closed loop method, respectively. In STZ-treated mice, ileal P-gp expression levels and activity significantly decreased on the 9th day after STZ administration. Interestingly, the decrease of P-gp function was recovered to the control level on 15th day in same conditioned mice. In addition, the recovery of P-gp expression levels was completely suppressed by a non-selective NOS inhibitor. These results indicate that the diabetic condition-induced decline of P-gp expression levels was temporary, and both decline- and recovery-process of intestinal P-gp expression levels are mediated by NOS. Furthermore, this study shows the bidirectional effect of NOS on regulation of intestinal P-gp expression.</str>

      <str>Carrot (Daucus carota L.) cells respond to treatment with fungal elicitors by synthesizing wallbound p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA). The biosynthetic pathway to p-HBA is still hypothetical. Tracer experiments with L-phenylalanine indicate the involvement of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. 3,4 (Methylenedioxy) innamic acid, an inhibitor of hydrocycinnamate CoA ligase, inhibits the accumulation of anthocyanins in carrot, while it does not interfere with p-HBA synthesis. Thus p-HBA biosynthesis does not appear to involve CoA thioesters. In the present report the sequence of enzymic reactions leading to p-HBA was investigated in vitro using protein preparations from cells treated with a fungal elicitor from Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. The side-chain degradation from p-coumaric acid to p-HBA is not analogous to the β-oxidation of fatty acids and involves p-hydroxybenzaldehyde as an intermediate. The final step from p-hydroxybenzaldehyde to p-HBA is catalyzed by an NAD-dependent p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.-). This reaction was characterized with regard to cofactor requirements, pH and temperature optima. The in-vitro formation of p-HBA from p-coumaric acid and the activity of the hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase are moderately elicitor-induced but to a much lesser extent than phenylalanine ammonialyase, which is the starting enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. </str>

      <str>Efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts substrate compounds from entering the brain and may thus contribute to pharmacoresistance observed in patient groups with refractory epilepsy and HIV. Altered P-gp function has also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Positron emission tomography (PET), a molecular imaging modality, has become a promising method to study the role of P-gp at the BBB. The first PET study of P-gp function was conducted in 1998, and during the past 15 years two main categories of P-gp PET tracers have been investigated: tracers that are substrates of P-gp efflux and tracers that are inhibitors of P-gp function. PET, as a noninvasive imaging technique, allows translational research. Examples of this are preclinical investigations of P-gp function before and after administering P-gp modulating drugs, investigations in various animal and disease models, and clinical investigations regarding disease and aging. The objective of the present review is to give an overview of available PET radiotracers for studies of P-gp and to discuss how such studies can be designed. Further, the review summarizes results from PET studies of P-gp function in different central nervous system disorders.</str>

Eighty-eight breast cancer patients and 84 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. A Spectraspan V direct current plasma atomic emission spectrometer was used to determine the serum levels of 15 trace elements including Zn, Mn, Al, Cd, Fe, Mg, Ca, Pb, Cu, Se, Ni, Ti, Co, Li, and Cr. Breast cancer patients had significantly higher serum levels of Cd (p = 0.000), Mg (p = 0.001), Cu (p = 0.000), Co (p = 0.006), and Li (p = 0.003) and borderline higher Cr (p = 0.052), while significantly lower Mn (p = 0.000), Al (p = 0.000), Fe (p = 0.000), and Ti (p = 0.000) compared to their matched controls.

The presence of only P. parodii chloroplasts in the somatic hybrid of P. parodii + P. inflata is possibly due to the stringent selection used for somatic hybrid production. However, in the case of the two other somatic hybrids P. parodii + P. hybrida and P. parodii + P. parviflora it was not possible to determine whether the presence of only P. parodii chloroplasts in these somatic hybrid plants was due to the nature of the selection schemes used or simply occurred by chance.

      <str>Based on data indicating that compounds which induce cytochrome P-450d also bind to the enzyme [R. Voorman and S. D. Aust (1987). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 90, 69-78], we investigated the inhibition of cytochrome P-450d-dependent estradiol 2-hydroxylase by (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD), using ligand-free cytochrome P-450d from isosafrole-treated rats. Since maximum inhibition of estradiol 2-hydroxylase occurred at TCDD concentrations comparable to the concentration of enzyme (50 nM), a modified form of steady-state kinetic analysis was used. Using I50 = Et/2 + Ki where Et = total enzyme concentration), we showed that TCDD inhibited cytochrome P-450d-dependent estradiol 2-hydroxylase activity with Ki equal to 8 nM. Association of TCDD with P-450d occurred within 2 min of inhibitor addition. Therefore, TCDD can be considered a tight binding inhibitor of cytochrome P-450d.</str>

      <str>Neonates have been shown to have a heightened sensitivity to the central depressive effects of opioids compared to older infants and adults. The limited development of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) may limit the ability of the neonate to efflux morphine from the brain back to the systemic circulation. The objective of the study was to determine the ontogeny of P-gp in the human brain.</str>
      <str>Postmortem cortex samples from gestational age (GA) 20-26 wk, GA 36-40 wk, postnatal age (PNA) 0-3 mo, PNA 3-6 mo, and adults were immunostained for P-gp.</str>
      <str>The intensity of P-gp staining in adults was significantly higher compared to at GA 20-26 wk (P &lt; 0.05), GA 36-40 wk (P &lt; 0.05), and PNA 0-3 mo (P &lt; 0.05). P-gp intensity at GA 20-26 wk (P &lt; 0.05), GA 36-40 wk (P &lt; 0.05), and PNA 0-3 mo (P &lt; 0.05) was significantly lower compared to at PNA 3-6 mo.</str>
      <str>P-gp expression in the brain is limited at birth, increases with postnatal maturation, and reaches adult levels at ~3-6 mo of age. Given the immaturity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) P-gp after birth, morphine may concentrate in the brain. This provides mechanistic support to life threatening opioid toxicity seen with maternal codeine use during breastfeeding.</str>

      <str>The natural antibiotic susceptibility of 38 Providencia rettgeri, 35 P. stuartii, 23 P. alcalifaciens and 20 P. rustigianii strains was examined. MIC values were determined by a microdilution procedure and evaluated by a table calculation programme. P. stuartii was the least susceptible Providencia sp. and was naturally resistant to tetracyclines, some penicillins, older cephalosporins, sulphamethoxazole and fosfomycin and to antibiotics to which other species of Enterobacteriaceae are also resistant. It was naturally sensitive to modern penicillins and cephalosporins, carbapenems and aztreonam, but its susceptibility to aminoglycosides and quinolones was difficult to assess. P. alcalifaciens and P. rustigianii strains were the most susceptible Providencia spp. They were naturally sensitive or intermediate to tetracyclines and sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. Susceptibility to sparfloxacin, biapenem and sulphamethoxazole permitted the discrimination of P. alcalifaciens and P. rustigianii strains. The natural antibiotic susceptibility of P. rettgeri strains was between that of P. stuartii and that of the other providenciae. P. rettgeri was resistant to tetracyclines and fosfomycin, but more susceptible to aminoglycosides, quinolones, fosfomycin and numerous beta-lactam antibiotics than P. stuartii. A database is described of the natural antibiotic susceptibilities of Providencia spp. It can be used for the validation of antibiotic susceptibility test results of these micro-organisms.</str>

      <str>The expression and function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-dependent efflux pump, were examined in rats pretreated with dexamethasone (DEX), an inducer of P-gp, and in rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure (ARF) and with CCl4-induced acute hepatic failure (AHF). DEX pretreatment increased the P-gp level and its functional activity in the intestine. In contrast, in ARF and AHF rats, the in vivo P-gp function was systemically suppressed, even though the level of P-gp remained unchanged or rather increased. In Caco-2 cells, the plasma collected from diseased rats exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on P-gp function than did plasma from control rats. A higher-plasma level of corticosterone, an endogenous P-gp substrate/inhibitor, was observed in the disease rats. These findings indicate that the actual in vivo function of P-gp cannot be predicted merely from the expression level of P-gp, and suggest that some endogenous P-gp-related compounds such as corticosterone participate in the regulation of in vivo P-gp function in diseased states.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) availability drives niche differentiation in the most abundant phytoplankter in the oceans, the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. We compared the molecular response of Prochlorococcus strain MED4 to P starvation in batch culture to P-limited growth in chemostat culture. We also identified an outer membrane porin, PMM0709, which may allow transport of organic phosphorous compounds, rather than phosphate as previously suggested. The expression of three P uptake genes, pstS, the high-affinity phosphate-binding component of the phosphate transporter, phoA, an alkaline phosphatase, and porin PMM0709, were strongly upregulated (between 10- and 700-fold) under both P starvation and limitation. pstS exhibits high basal expression under P-replete conditions and is likely necessary for P uptake regardless of P availability. A P-stress regulatory gene, ptrA, was upregulated in response to both P starvation and limitation although a second regulatory gene, phoB, was not. Elevated expression levels (&gt; 10-fold) of phoR, a P-sensing histidine kinase, were only observed under conditions of P limitation. We suggest Prochlorococcus in P-limited systems are physiologically distinct from cells subjected to abrupt P depletion. Detection of expression of both pstS and phoR in field populations will enable discernment of the present P status of Prochlorococcus in the oligotrophic oceans. </str>

      <str>Phytophthora species are well-known as destructive plant pathogens, especially in natural ecosystems. It is ironic, therefore, how little is known regarding the Phytophthora diversity in South African natural woody ecosystems. In this study, Phytophthora species were isolated using standard baiting techniques from 182 soil and water samples and these were identified based on ITS and coxI sequence data. The 171 resulting Phytophthora isolates resided in 14 taxa including six known species (P. multivora, P. capensis, P. cryptogea, P. frigida, P. cinnamomi, P. cinnamomi var. parvispora), the known but as yet unnamed Phytophthora sp. PgChlamydo, P. sp. emzansi, and P. sp. Kununurra and five novel taxa referred to as P. sp. stellaris, P. sp. Umtamvuna P. sp. canthium, P. sp. xWS, P. sp. xHennops. Four of the new taxa were found exclusively in water and two of these are hybrids. The most commonly isolated species from soil was P. multivora, a species recently described from Western Australia. Phytophthora frigida was isolated for the first time from stream water. With the exception of P. cinnamomi, very little is known regarding the biology, epidemiology or origin of Phytophthora in South Africa. </str>

      <str>The genus Pteronotropis is widely distributed along the gulf slope of eastern North America from Louisiana to Florida and rivers in South Carolina along the Atlantic slope. Pteronotropis have very distinctive, flamboyant coloration. The habitats most frequently associated with these species include heavily vegetated backwater bayous to small sluggish or flowing tannin-stained streams. Although Pteronotropis is recognized as a valid genus, no phylogenetic analysis of all the species has corroborated its monophyly. In recent years, four additional species have been either described or elevated from synonymy: P. merlini, P. grandipinnis, P. stonei, and P. metallicus, with the wide-ranging P. hypselopterus complex. To examine relationships within this genus and test its monophyly, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using two nuclear genes, recombination activating gene 1, RAG1, and the first intron of S7 ribosomal protein gene in both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. In no analysis was Pteronotropis, as currently recognized, recovered as monophyletic without the inclusion of the currently recognized Notropis harperi, herein referred to as Pteronotropis. Two major clades are supported: one inclusive of P. hubbsi, P. welaka, and P. harperi and the second inclusive of P. signipinnis, P. grandipinnis, P. hypselopterus plus P. merlini sister to P. euryzonus, and P. metallicus plus P. stonei. </str>

This study aimed at investigating the possible role of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptors (ERs) in STs pathogenesis through their immunohistochemical (IHC) localization in skin biopsies of this disease and to correlate their expression with different clinical and histopathological parameters. Using IHC techniques, we examined 62 cases with STs and 30 gender- and age-matched, healthy subjects, representing the control group. ERα, ERβ, and AR were upregulated in STs compared to normal skin in epidermis and dermis (p &lt; .001 for all). Higher AR H score was significantly associated with axillary STs (p = .02), skin colored tags (p = .03), acanthosis, and papillomatosis (p = .04 for both). Higher ERα H score was significantly associated with hyperpigmented tags (p &lt; .001) and positive family history (p = .003). Higher ERβ H score was significantly associated with female gender and obesity (p = .004 for both). Higher ERα and AR H scores were significantly associated with loose collagen arrangement (p = .02, p = .004, respectively). Higher AR, ERα, and ERβ H scores were significantly associated with the presence of mast cells (p = .01, p = .04, p = .002, respectively) and dilated blood vessels (p = .006, p = .04, p = .04, respectively). In conclusion, AR and ERs may share in STs pathogenesis through their effect on keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and mast cells.</str>

      <str>Sustainable agriculture requires improved phosphorus (P) management to reduce the overreliance on P fertilization. Despite intensive research of root adaptive mechanisms for improving P acquisition, the inherent potential of roots for efficient P acquisition remains unfulfilled, especially in intensive agriculture, while current P management generally focuses on agronomic and environmental concerns. Here, we investigated how levels of soil P affect the inherent potential of maize (Zea mays L.) roots to obtain P from soil. Responses of root morphology, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, and phosphate transporters were characterized and related to agronomic traits in pot and field experiments with soil P supply from deficiency to excess. Critical soil Olsen-P level for maize growth approximated 3.2 mg kg(-1), and the threshold indicating a significant environmental risk was about 15 mg kg(-1), which represented the lower and upper levels of soil P recommended in current P management. However, most root adaptations involved with P acquisition were triggered when soil Olsen-P was below 10 mg kg(-1), indicating a threshold for maximum root inherent potential. Therefore, to maintain efficient inherent potential of roots for P acquisition, we suggest that the target upper level of soil P in intensive agriculture should be reduced from the environmental risk threshold to the point maximizing the inherent potential of roots.</str>

      <str>The current study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with a lyophilized powder made from plums (P) on host protective immune responses against avian coccidiosis, the most economically important parasitic disease of poultry. One-day-old White Leghorn chickens were fed from the time of hatch with a standard diet either without P (control and P 0 groups) or supplemented with P at 0.5% (P 0.5) or 1.0% (P 1.0) of the diet. Animals in the P 0, P 0.5, and P 1.0 groups were orally challenged with 5000 sporulated oocysts of Eimeria acervulina at day 12 post-hatch, while control animals were uninfected. Dietary supplementation of P increased body weight gain, reduced fecal oocyst shedding, and increased the levels of mRNAs for interferon-gamma and interleukin-15 in the P 1.0 group at 10 days post-infection compared with the P 0 group. Furthermore, chickens fed either the P 0.5 or P 1.0 diets exhibited significantly greater spleen cell proliferation compared with the non-plum P 0 group. These results indicate that plum possesses immune enhancing properties, and that feeding chickens a plum-supplemented diet augments protective immunity against coccidiosis.</str>

      <str>Substance P is present in several neurons innervating the lung. Tachykinin receptors are expressed on submucosal gland cells. Substance P is known to be a potent stimulator of airway mucus secretion. In the present study we characterized the effects of galanin and somatostatin on basal and substance P-induced mucus secretion. The stimulatory effect of substance P was concentration-dependent (100 pmol/l: 112%, 1 nmol/l: 120%, 10 nmol/l: 153%, 100 nmol/l: 223%, 1 mumol/l: 275%, 10 mumol/l: 172%) and was inhibited by galanin and somatostatin (1 mumol/l substance P: 277%; 1 mumol/l substance P + 1 mumol/l somatostatin: 190%, p &lt; 0.01; 1 mumol/l substance P + 1 mumol/l galanin: 206%, p &lt; 0.05). In the presence of lower concentrations of substance P 1 mumol/l somatostatin and 1 mumol/l galanin did not modify mucus secretion. Lower concentrations of galanin and somatostatin did not significantly change mucus secretion stimulated by 1 mumol/l substance P. Both, galanin and somatostatin at 1 mumol/l left basal airway mucus secretion unaltered. These data suggest that mucus secretion into airways is regulated by a complex network of peptidergic stimulators and inhibitors including substance P, somatostatin and galanin.</str>

      <str>The degree of strain and/or species diversity among Pneumocystis carinii isolates is unknown. As a first approach to the study of P. carinii genetic relatedness, we compared the pulsed field gel electrophoretic karyotypes of P. carinii derived from lung homogenates of three immunosuppressed host animals: rats transtracheally inoculated with P. carinii-infected mouse lung; and ferrets which developed reactivated latent P. carinii pneumonia. Rat P. carinii propagated on HEL299 cells was also examined. Karyotypes of P. carinii DNA from both rat lung homogenate and cell culture were identical (14 bands, 315-680 kb). In contrast, mouse and ferret P. carinii DNA karyotypes were each distinctly different from the rat P. carinii samples (mouse P. carinii 15 bands, 315-610 kb; ferret P. carinii nine bands, 410-760 kb). Three distinct rat P. carinii gene probes reacted with both Southern-transferred rat and mouse P. carinii DNA but not with ferret P. carinii DNA. Thus, P. carinii from rat, mouse, and ferret are genetically diverse. The results are consistent with recently reported antigenic and nucleic acid sequence differences among P. carinii isolates recovered from different hosts.</str>

      <str>A form of cytochrome P-450 which comigrates with cytochrome P-450LM4 (molecular weight, 55 000) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel was purified from liver microsomes of cholestyramine-treated rabbits. This form of cytochrome P-450 catalyzed the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol with an activity of 37.5 pmol/min per nmol cytochrome P-450 in the reconstituted enzyme system containing cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The substrate specificity of this form of cytochrome P-450 was compared with cytochrome P-450LM4 isolated from phenobarbital- and beta-naphthoflavone-treated rabbit liver microsomes. The latter two isoenzymes do not catalyze 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol, but are more active in O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin and p-nitrophenetole. Ouchterlony double diffusion revealed cross-reactivity between anti-P-450LM4 (phenobarbital) IgG and cytochrome P-450 isolated from cholestyramine- or beta-naphthoflavone-treated rabbit liver microsomes.

The mutant p53 protein causes reduced tumour suppression. Co-expression of p53 and P-gp is related to short survival, increased tumour activity and drug resistance. The purpose of this study was to measure the expression of p53 protein and P-gp in osteosarcoma tissue and assess its prognostic significance. Fifty-two tumour specimens were evaluated. The correlation between p53 and P-gp expression was significant (P=0.0008). In univariate analysis of survival, p53 protein was not significant (P=0.2) but P-gp was significant (P=0.0001).

      <str>Phosphorus (P) leaching from a sandy soil was investigated in the presence of modified and unmodified clay minerals and nanoparticles (NPs). Compared with control soil, amended soil with NPs had the highest percentage of P retention than amended soil with clay minerals. Among the adsorbents used, the highest percentage of P retention was produced by Al₂O₃-chitosan while the lowest percentage of P retention was by zeolite. Data measured for P leaching after using adsorbents were used to predict P leaching using transport model. PHREEQC model was able to model P leaching from control and amended soil. After leaching, P values in control and amended soil were fractionated by a sequential extraction procedure. Concentration of P in Ca-bound fraction (HCl-P) after application of modified and unmodified clay minerals and NPs (except TiO₂ and Al₂O₃) increased and decreased, respectively. Saturation indices (SIs) and P speciation were assessed using the Visual MINTEQ version 2.3 program. According to the SIs, leaching P from control and amended soil with different adsorbent was controlled by dissolution of hydroxyapatite. The results indicated that used adsorbents can reduce P leaching from the sandy soil. Thus, retention of P by amended soil reduced a risk in terms of groundwater contamination with P.</str>

      <str>A cytochrome P-450 (P-450) was purified from abdominal microsomes of untreated and phenobarbital treated susceptible (S+) and insecticide-resistant (LPR) houseflies using HPLC purification procedures. The purified P-450s exhibited the same apparent molecular masses (54,400 dalton) and could not be distinguished from each other on the basis of HPLC chromatographic properties, reduced CO-difference absorbance maxima (447 +/- 0.5 nm), or partial NH2-terminal sequences (MLLLLLLIVVTTLYIFAKL). Since these P-450s were indistinguishable and were immunologically identical to cytochrome P-450lpr we conclude that these P-450s are in fact cytochrome P-450lpr. The level of P-450lpr was increased twofold after PB exposure in the S+ strain, while the level of P-450lpr did not change in the LPR strain. Immunoinhibition of ECOD activity with anti-P-450lpr antiserum suggests that PB treatment in S+ house flies induced P-450lpr, and other forms of cytochromes P-450 with high activity toward this substrate.</str>

      <str>The form of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 induced by chronic administration of ethanol to rabbits, designated as P-450ALC or P-450 isozyme 3a, has been purified to homogeneity as judged by several criteria, including NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequence determination. The reconstituted alcohol-P-450 oxygenase (APO) system containing P-450ALC and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, including methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, 2-butanol, n-pentanol, and cyclohexanol. Other purified P-450 cytochromes, including isozymes 2, 3b, 3c, 4, and 6, are much less active than P-450ALC in the oxidation of alcohols. That P-450ALC functions in ethanol oxidation in liver microsomal membranes as well as in the reconstituted system was shown by immunochemical experiments involving inhibition by sheep anti-P-450ALC antibodies. We conclude that P-450ALC is the predominant ethanol-oxidizing cytochrome present after induction by chronic alcohol administration and that the other P-450 cytochromes have low but significant activity in both control and ethanol-induced animals.</str>

      <str>Two distinct forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450), referred to as P-450a and P-450b, were separated and purified from kidney cortex microsomes of rabbits treated with phenobarbital. P-450a had a monomeric molecular weight of 53,000, and its CO-reduced difference spectral peak was at 450 nm. It catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), and the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of myristate, but it was inactive toward exogenous compounds tested. On the other hand, P-450b had a monomeric molecular weight of 49,000, and its CO-reduced difference spectral peak was at 451 nm. This cytochrome was not able to hydroxylate PGA1 at all. It hydroxylated myristate much more slowly than P-450a, and preferentially at the (omega-1)-position. Unlike P-450a, P-450b efficiently metabolized exogenous compounds such as benzphetamine, aminopyrine, 7-ethoxycoumarin and p-nitroanisole. It is suggested that P-450a and P-450b are specialized for the metabolism of PGA1 and exogenous compounds, respectively, in kidney cortex microsomes.</str>

      <str>Previous research has suggested a trade-off between the capacity of plants to downregulate their phosphorus (P) uptake capacity and their efficiency of P resorption from senescent leaves in species from P-impoverished environments.</str>
      <str>To investigate this further, four Australian native species (Banksia attenuata, B. menziesii, Acacia truncata and A. xanthina) were grown in a greenhouse in nutrient solutions at a range of P concentrations [P]. Acacia plants received between 0 and 500 µm P; Banksia plants received between 0 and 10 µm P, to avoid major P-toxicity symptoms in these highly P-sensitive species.</str>
      <str>For both Acacia species, the net P-uptake rates measured at 10 µm P decreased steadily with increasing P supply during growth. In contrast, in B. attenuata, the net rate of P uptake from a solution with 10 µm P increased linearly with increasing P supply during growth. The P-uptake rate of B. menziesii showed no significant response to P supply in the growing medium. Leaf [P] of the four species supported this finding, with A. truncata and A. xanthina showing an increase up to a saturation value of 19 and 21 mg P g(-1) leaf dry mass, respectively (at 500 µm P), whereas B. attenuata and B. menziesii both exhibited a linear increase in leaf [P], reaching 10 and 13 mg P g(-1) leaf dry mass, respectively, without approaching a saturation point. The Banksia plants grown at 10 µm P showed mild symptoms of P toxicity, i.e. yellow spots on some leaves and drying and curling of the tips of the leaves. Leaf P-resorption efficiency was 69 % (B. attenuata), 73 % (B. menziesii), 34 % (A. truncata) and 36 % (A. xanthina). The P-resorption proficiency values were 0·08 mg P g(-1) leaf dry mass (B. attenuata and B. menziesii), 0·32 mg P g(-1) leaf dry mass (A. truncata) and 0·36 mg P g(-1) leaf dry mass (A. xanthina). Combining the present results with additional information on P-remobilization efficiency and the capacity to downregulate P-uptake capacity for two other Australian woody species, we found a strong negative correlation between these traits.</str>
      <str>It is concluded that species that are adapted to extremely P-impoverished soils, such as many south-western Australian Proteaceae species, have developed extremely high P-resorption efficiencies, but lost their capacity to downregulate their P-uptake mechanisms. The results support the hypothesis that the ability to resorb P from senescing leaves is inversely related to the capacity to downregulate net P uptake, possibly because constitutive synthesis of P transporters is a prerequisite for proficient P remobilization from senescing tissues.</str>

      <str>A major objective of this study was to extend the Vitti-Dias model used to describe P metabolism in ruminants, by adding 2 new pools to the original model to represent the rumen and saliva. An experiment was carried out using 24 male sheep, initial BW of 34.5 kg, aged 8 mo, fed a basal diet supplied with increasing amounts of dicalcium phosphate to provide 0.14, 0.32, 0.49, and 0.65% P in the diet. Sheep were individually housed indoors in metabolic cages and injected with a single dose of 7.4 MBq of (32)P into a jugular vein. Feed intake and total fecal and urinary outputs were recorded and sampled daily for 1 wk, and blood samples were obtained at 5 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 h after (32)P injection. Saliva and rumen fluid samples were taken on d 6, 7, and 8. Then, animals were slaughtered and samples from liver, kidney, testicle, muscle, and heart (soft tissue) and bone were collected. Specific radioactivity and inorganic P were then determined in bone, soft tissue, plasma, rumen, saliva, and feces, and used to calculate flows between pools. Increased P intake positively affected total P (r = 0.97, P &lt; 0.01) and endogenous P excretion in feces (r = 0.85, P &lt; 0.01), P flow from plasma to saliva (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.01), from saliva to rumen (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.01), and from lower gastrointestinal tract to plasma (r = 0.72, P &lt; 0.01). Urinary P excretion was similar for all treatments (P = 0.35). It was, however, related to plasma P (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.01) and to net P flow to bone (accretion - resorption; r = -0.64, P &lt; 0.01). Phosphorus intake affected net P flow to soft tissue (P = 0.04) but not net P flow to bone (P = 0.46). Phosphorus mobilized from bone was directed toward soft tissue, as suggested by the correlations between P flow from bone to plasma and net P flow to soft tissue (r = 0.89, P &lt; 0.01), and P flow from plasma to soft tissue and net P flow to bone (r = -0.76, P &lt; 0.01). The lack of effect of dietary P on net P accretion in bone suggests that P demand for bone formation was low and surplus P was partially used by soft tissue. In conclusion, the model resulted in appropriate biological description of P metabolism in sheep and added knowledge of the effects of surplus dietary P on P metabolism. Additionally, the model can be used as a tool to assess feeding strategies aiming to mitigate P excretion into the environment.</str>

Judging from the result of sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the molecular weight of P-450-D3 was estimated to be 54,000. The oxidized form of P-450-D3 showed a peak at 416 nm indicating that the cytochrome is mostly in a low spin state. The carbon monoxide bound reduced form of P-450-D3 showed a peak at 448 nm. In a reconstituted system, P-450-D3 catalyzed drug oxidations including benzphetamine and aminopyrine N-demethylations, 7-ethoxycoumarin and p-propoxyaniline O-dealkylations, and aniline and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylations. The rate of aniline hydroxylation catalyzed by P-450-D3 was similar to that catalyzed by P-450c which is a low spin form of cytochrome P-450 purified from liver microsomes of PCB-treated rats, whereas the catalytic activities of P-450-D3 for 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation were considerably lower than those of P-450c. The amino terminal portion of P-450-D3 was found to be highly similar to those of P-450d, human P3-450 and P3-450 when four amino acid deletions were tentatively inserted between fifth and sixth amino acids from the N-terminal, but not that of P-450c which is a low spin form of cytochrome P-448 purified from rat liver microsomes.

      <str>Dietary P supplied to feedlot cattle is important because an inadequate supply will compromise performance, whereas excess P may harm the environment. However, P requirements of feedlot cattle are not well documented. Therefore, 45 steer calves (265.2+/-16.6 kg) were individually fed to determine the P required for gain and bone integrity over a 204-d finishing period. The basal diet consisted of 33.5% high-moisture corn, 30% brewers grits, 20% corn bran, 7.5% cottonseed hulls, 3% tallow, and 6% supplement. Treatments consisted of 0.16 (no supplemental inorganic P), 0.22, 0.28, 0.34, and 0.40% P (DM basis). Supplemental P was provided by monosodium phosphate top-dressed to the daily feed allotment. Blood was sampled every 56 d to assess P status. At slaughter, phalanx and metacarpal bones were collected from the front leg to determine bone ash and assess P resorption from bone. Dry matter intake and ADG did not change linearly (P &gt; 0.86) or quadratically (P &gt; 0.28) due to P treatment. Feed efficiency was not influenced (P &gt; 0.30) by P treatment and averaged 0.169. Plasma inorganic P averaged across d 56 to 204 responded quadratically, with calves fed 0.16% P having the lowest concentration of plasma inorganic P. However, plasma inorganic P concentration (5.7 mg/dL) for steers fed 0.16% P is generally considered adequate. Total bone ash weight was not influenced by dietary P for phalanx (P = 0.19) or metacarpal bones (P = 0.37). Total P intake ranged from 14.2 to 35.5 g/d. The NRC (1996) recommendation for these calves was 18.7 g/d, assuming 68% absorption. Based on performance results, P requirements for finishing calves is &lt; 0.16% of diet DM or 14.2 g/d. Based on these observations, we suggest that typical grain-based feedlot cattle diets do not require supplementation of inorganic mineral P to meet P requirements.</str>

      <str>The relationship between lipids and breast cancer is obscure. Until now, conflicting results have been reported on the association between lipids and risk of breast cancer in women. Therefore, the major aim of this study is to examine the role of alterations in lipid profile in breast cancer.</str>
      <str>Plasma lipids (ie, total cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], and triglycerides [TG]) were analyzed from 70 controls, 30 patients with benign breast disease (BBD), 125 untreated breast cancer patients, and 93 posttreatment follow-up samples.</str>
      <str>Samples were analyzed using highly sensitive and specific spectrophotometric methods.</str>
      <str>Plasma TC, LDL, VLDL, and TG were significantly lower (p = .042, p = .003, p = .024, p = .014, respectively) in patients with BBD compared with controls. Plasma TC and HDL were significantly lower (p = .026, p = .0001, respectively), and VLDL and TG were significantly higher (p = .009, p = .05) in breast cancer patients as compared with controls. Plasma VLDL and TG were significantly higher in breast cancer patients as compared with patients with BBD. The receiver-operating characteristic curve showed that plasma TC, LDL, VLDL, and TG levels could significantly discriminate (p = .001, p = .005, p = .005, p = .005, respectively) between controls and patients with BBD. Plasma levels of TC, HDL, VLDL, and TG could significantly distinguish (p = .01, p = .002, p = .001, p = .002, respectively) between controls and breast cancer patients. Plasma levels of VLDL and TG could significantly discriminate (p = .000, p = .000, respectively) between patients with BBD and breast cancer patients. Odds ratio analysis revealed that higher levels of TC and HDL were significantly associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk (p = .01 and p = .0001, respectively), whereas higher levels of VLDL and TG were significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk (p = .001 and p = .002, respectively). Plasma VLDL and TG levels were significantly lower in complete responders as compared with pretreatment levels (p = .000, p = .000, respectively), and plasma TC and LDL levels were significantly lower in nonresponders as compared with pretreatment levels (p = .015, p = .009, respectively).</str>

      <str>Bombyx mori is a female-heterogametic organism (female, ZW; male, ZZ) that appears to have a putative feminizing gene (Fem) on the W chromosome. The paternally transmitted mutant W chromosome, Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem, derived from the translocation-carrying W chromosome (p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od )), is inert as femaleness determinant. Moreover, this Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome has been thought to have a female-killing factor because no female larvae having the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome are produced. Initially, to investigate whether the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome contains any region of the W chromosome or not, we analyzed the presence or absence of 12 W-specific RAPD markers. The Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome contained 3 of 12 W-specific RAPD markers. These results strongly indicate that the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome contains the region of the W chromosome. Moreover, by using phenotypic and molecular markers, we confirmed that the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome is connected with a partially deleted Z chromosome and that this fused chromosome behaves as a Z chromosome during male meiosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the ZZW-type triploid female having the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome is viable. Therefore, we concluded that the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome does not have a female-killing factor but that partial deletion of the Z chromosome causes the death of the ZW-type diploid female having the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome. Additionally, our results of detailed genetic analyses strongly indicate that the female-killing chromosome composed of the Df(p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ))Fem chromosome and deleted Z chromosome was generated by translocation between the Z chromosome and the translocation-carrying W chromosome, p ( Sa ) + ( p )W + ( od ).</str>

      <str>Quantitative meta-analysis was run on 108 publications featuring 116 experiments and 399 treatments dealing with the effect of trough or pasture feeding environment (FE) on ruminant performances. The objective was to compare the effect of trough or pasture FE on ADG, diet OM digestibility (OMD), various carcass characteristics, and the interaction between FE and complementation modalities. Live weight was adjusted to compare results between species. Results showed that trough-fed animals had higher ADG (+17.89%; P &lt; 0.001), hot carcass yield (HYield; + 2.47%; P &lt; 0.001) and carcass fat content (+ 24.87%; P &lt; 0.001) than pasture-fed animals but lower carcass muscle and bone percentages (-1.60% [P = 0.010] and -7.63% [P = 0.003], respectively). Feeding environment had no effect on diet OMD (P = 0.818), but the number of observations was low. After considering the addition or not of concentrate in the diet (addiCO), FE effect persisted on ADG (P = 0.024) and carcass fat content (P = 0.027) but not on HYield (P = 0.078) or muscle and bone percentages (P = 0.119 and P = 0.581, respectively). After considering the nature of the concentrate (natCO), FE effect persisted on ADG (P &lt; 0.001) and HYield (P = 0.004). Considering the percentage of concentrate in the diet (PCO) erased FE effect on ADG (P = 0.891) and HYield (P = 0.128). In contrast, considering the quantity of concentrate(QCO) erased FE effect on ADG (P = 0.084) but not on HYield (P = 0.006) or on carcass fat and muscle contents (P = 0.040 and P = 0.040, respectively) although the FE effect on carcass bone content persisted (P = 0.550). Animal species and physiological stage had no effect on any of the variables studied (P &gt; 0.05) but experiment did (P ≤ 0.001). The increase in ADG was positively correlated to HYield in cattle (P = 0.002) and small ruminants (P = 0.003) and positively linked to carcass fat content (P = 0.007) but not carcass muscle content, which actually decreased (P = 0.001). Overall, this meta-analysis confirmed previous reports of FE effects and revealed how the differences generally reported result from a confounding effect of FE and nature of the diet. Indeed, in most of the studies used, trough-fed animals were supplemented with concentrate whereas pasture-fed animals were not. This research also highlighted the fact that pasture-fed animals have the potential to achieve the same performances as trough-fed animals when fed a similar diet. </str>

      <str>Seventy-two growing pigs (initial BW: 18.0 ± 1.6 kg) were used to determine the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P and Ca and the standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of P in 8 different sources of meat and bone meal (MBM) and to develop equations to predict digestibility of P and Ca in MBM. Pigs were housed individually in metabolism cages and were randomly allotted to 9 diets with 8 replicate pigs per diet. Eight diets were formulated by mixing cornstarch, sucrose, soybean oil, sodium chloride, vitamin-mineral premix, and 8% of each source of MBM, and MBM was the sole source of P and Ca in each diet. A P-free diet was used to measure basal endogenous P losses (EPL) by the pigs. Feces were collected for 5 d based on the marker to marker approach after a 5-d adaptation period. On an as-fed basis, the concentration of P in the MBM sources ranged from 2.6 to 5.3% with an average of 4.3 ± 0.8% whereas Ca concentration ranged from 5.1 to 11.0% with an average of 9.2 ± 2.0%. The variation among MBM samples in Ca and P concentrations was calculated (CV = 22.1 and 20.0%, respectively) as was the variation in the concentration of other chemical components (CV = 6.2, 10.5, and 13.8% for CP, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract, and ash, respectively). The ATTD of P (52.1 to 80.1%, average = 65.9 ± 8.8%) and Ca (53.0 to 81.0%, average = 63.9 ± 9.4%) differed (P &lt; 0.05) among MBM sources. The basal EPL was measured at 106 ± 51 mg/kg DMI in pigs fed the P-free diet. The STTD of P was different (54.8 to 84.4%; average = 68.8 ± 9.3%; P &lt; 0.05) among MBM sources. The ATTD of Ca and the STTD of P decreased (P &lt; 0.01) as ash, Ca, and P concentration in MBM increased, and the ATTD of Ca was positively related (R(2) = 0.99, P &lt; 0.001) with the STTD of P. The STTD of P (%) in MBM may be predicted as 107.857 - 8.8 × total P [R(2) = 0.68, root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.73, P &lt; 0.01] whereas ATTD of Ca (%) may be predicted as 105.375 - 9.327 × total P (R(2) = 0.75, RMSE = 4.70, P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, P and Ca digestibility varies among sources of MBM, but prediction equations using the concentration of total P in MBM may be used to estimate P and Ca digestibility in MBM fed to growing pigs.</str>

      <str>This study aimed to compare the effects of glimepiride and glibenclamide on glycaemic control and a range of risk factors for ischaemic heart disease (IHD), including concentrations of insulin-like molecules.</str>
      <str>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover comparison of 4 weeks of treatment with glibenclamide 2.5 to 20 mg/day and glimepiride 1 to 8 mg/day was undertaken in 29 type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. The average (mean +/- SD) duration of diabetes was 8.5 (+/- 5.9) years.</str>

      <str>To investigate seasonal variations in tissue phosphorus (P) levels, P to protein ratio, and P to omega-3 fatty acid (ω3-FA) ratio in 2 species of fish that are commonly consumed in Lebanon. We aim to determine suitability for dietary management of renal patients.</str>
      <str>Siganus rivulatus (rabbitfish) and Diplodus sargus (white seabream) were caught in traps off the coast of Beirut and transported on ice to the laboratory during various seasons. Fillets of fish were removed, dried to constant weight at 95°C, finely ground, and stored at -20°C. Protein, P, P to protein ratio, and P to ω3-FA ratio were determined.</str>
      <str>Compared with white seabream (carnivore), rabbitfish (algaevore) had a significantly lower mean P content (±SE) (895 ± 32 mg/100 g vs. 1,132 ± 23 mg/100 g; P &lt; .0001), a significantly lower P to protein ratio (±SE) (10.35 ± 0.39 vs. 13.15 ± 0.34 mg P/g of protein; P &lt; .001), and a significantly lower P to ω3-FA ratio (±SE) (2.81 ± 0.29 vs. 5.93 ± 1.05 g of ω3-FA/g of P; P &lt; .005). P content in flesh of both species varied significantly with season (P &lt; .0001). Rabbitfish P content was least in August and greatest in June (P &lt; .05), whereas white seabream P content was greatest in April and least in June (P &lt; .05). Rabbitfish muscle P to protein ratio and P to ω3-FA ratio was least in August, with a significantly greater P to ω3-FA ratio during the rest of the year. White seabream exhibited wider seasonal variation in P to protein ratio and P to ω3-FA ratio as compared with rabbitfish.</str>
      <str>Because of differences and seasonal variations in P levels that exist among fish species, renal dietitians may need to identify the seasonal proximate composition of individual fish species in various habitats and formulate dietary regimens accordingly. Such advice notwithstanding, oily marine fish remain a healthy food choice for dialysis patients if the fillet is consumed without bones.</str>

      <str>The ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 regions of 33 accessions belonging to 16 species and five natural and garden interspecific hybrids of the genus Paeonia L. were sequenced. Chromatograms of the peony hybrids demonstrated the presence of the signals, corresponding to two different nucleotides at the positions differing in the parents, indicating that in the hybrids, no rDNA isogenization usually occurred, and they preserved rDNA of both parents. Analysis of these polymorphic sites (PS) showed that P. x majkoae was interspecific hybrid between P. tenuifolia and P. caucasica. The ITS of P. hybrida differs from ITS of P. x majkoae in 19 mutations. Because of this, P. x majkoae is definitely not synonymous to P. hybrida. Comparative analysis of ITS 1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 showed that species diversity in section Paeonia was based on recombination as a result of intraspecific hybridization of three haplotype families. Specifically, haplotypes A, typical of the P. tenuifolia and P. anomala genomes, haplotypes B, typical of P. mlokosewitschii and P. obovata, and haplotypes of family C, currently represented in rDNA of diploid and tetraploid forms of some Caucasian and Mediterranean species. The ITS regions many diploid peonies contain no dimorphic sites, while P. oreogeton, P. cambessedesii, P. rhodia, and P. daurica carry from ten to 17 PS, and supposed to be the interspecific hybrids. Most of the tetraploid peonies contain from six to 18 PS in the ITS regions. These are alloploids with one of the parental genomes similar to that of P. mlokosewitschii (B1), or P. obovata (B3). The second parental genome in P. banatica, P. peregrina, and P. russii is represented by the genome, close to that of P. tenuifolia (A). P. macrophylla, P. mascula, P. coriacea, P. wittmanniana, and P. tomentosa carry genome of series B and genome of series C, which slightly resembles genome A.</str>

      <str>The responses of right nostril breathing (RNB) and left nostril breathing (LNB) on cardio-respiratory and autonomic functions were investigated in healthy student volunteers of both sexes. The RNB and LNB groups comprised of 10 males and 10 females in each in age range of 17-22 years. Initially, in both groups control values of respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBF), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and galvanic skin resistance (GSR) were recorded. The same parameters were recorded after 15 min (acute exposure) and 8 wks of training in RNB and LNB. In males RR (P&lt;0.0001), SBP (P&lt;0.05) and DBF (P&lt;.05) fell significantly after 15 min of RNB. After 8 wks training in RNB, HR (P&lt;0.01) decreased, SBP (P&lt;0.001) declined more profoundly and RR (P&lt;0.0001) and DBP (P&lt;0.05) decrement was maintained. After 15 min of LNB, RR (P&lt;0.01), HR (P&lt;0.01), SBP (P&lt;0.001) and DBP (P&lt;0.01) declined significantly, on 8 wks training, RR (P&lt;0.0001) and HR (P&lt;0.001) decreased further, the decrement in SBP (P&lt;0.001) and DBP (P&lt;0.01) was the same. In females, RR alone fell significantly (P&lt;0.05) after 15 min RNB. After 8 wks RR decrement was more profound (P&lt;0.0001) and DBP also declined significantly (P&lt;0.01). Similarly, 15 min LNB resulted in significant reduction in RR (P&lt;0.001) and HR (P&lt;0.05) only. Following 8 wks, of training in LNB, in addition to RR (P&lt;0.0001) and HR (P&lt;0.05) decrement, SBP (P&lt;0.01) and DBP (P&lt;0.05) also fell significantly. Both in males and females, GSR did not change significantly (P&gt;0.05) either after RNB or LNB (15 min/8 wks). PEFR rose significantly (P&lt;0.05) only in females after 8 wks of LNB. The results suggest that there are no sharp distinctions between effects of RNB and LNB either acute exposure (15 min) or after training (8 wks). However, there is a general parasympathetic dominance evoked by both these breathing patterns.</str>

      <str>A balance study was performed in order to quantify the effect of continuously increased phosphorus (P) intake on faecal and urinary P excretion. The aim was to quantify the level of intake where regulatory P excretion becomes relevant for comparative digestibility measurements on P, and when the pig adapts its urinary P excretion to increased P intake. Phosphorus intake of growing pigs was continuously increased on a daily basis starting at a marginal level and P excretion via faeces and urine was continuously followed for 92 days. Two semi-synthetic diets were prepared with different proportions of Na2HPO4 resulting in 2.4 (diet 1) and 6.3 (diet 2) g P/kg DM. Concentration of Ca was adapted to achieve a Ca supply approximately 3.1 fold the digestible P supply. Six castrated male crossbred pigs (31 kg BW) were kept individually in metabolism crates after they had undergone a 14 d P depletion period during which they were fed diet 1 solely. Pigs received 1.04kg of diet 1 per day throughout the experiment, and each day the amount of feed and P supplied to pigs from diet 2 was increased by 12 g and 69 mg, respectively. ME supply was approximately 2.4 fold maintenance and average daily BW gain of pigs during the entire experiment was 690 +/- 30 g. While intake increased linearly, faecal excretion of P and Ca increased non-linearly and could be best described by third order polynomial functions. The proportion of ingested P not excreted via faeces followed a quadratic type of curve with a maximum of 81% at 25 days on experiment and P intake of 4.0 g/d. Thereafter, the proportion decreased continuously. The digestibility of P from diet 2, determined by the slope ratio technique, was constant and not affected by P intake up to a P intake of 5 g/d. Renal P excretion did not exceed inevitable losses until day 60 and increased exponentially thereafter when body P reserves were restored. It is concluded, that an adaptation to surplus P supply occurred earlier on the intestinal than on the renal level. While faecal P excretion appeared regulated depending on the actual requirement for P retention, the regulation via urine depended on the P status of the pig. Once the renal P excretion of growing pigs exceeds a level of 25 mg/d, intake of digestible P cannot be regarded sufficiently low to measure P digestibility as a capacity of the feedstuff.</str>

      <str>Twelve young adult (1.7 +/- 0.1 yr) male cats were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design to determine the effects of fiber type on nutrient digestibility, fermentative end products, and fecal microbial populations. Three diets containing 4% cellulose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), or pectin were evaluated. Feces were scored based on the 5-point system: 1 being hard, dry pellets, and 5 being watery liquid that can be poured. No differences were observed (P &gt; 0.100) in intake of DM, OM, CP, or acid-hydrolyzed fat; DM or OM digestibility; or fecal pH, DM%, output on an as-is or DM basis, or concentrations of histamine or phenylalanine. Crude protein and fat digestibility decreased (P = 0.079 and 0.001, respectively) in response to supplementation with pectin compared with cellulose. Both FOS and pectin supplementation resulted in increased fecal scores (P &lt; 0.001) and concentrations of ammonia (P = 0.003) and 4-methyl phenol (P = 0.003). Fecal indole concentrations increased (P = 0.049) when cats were supplemented with FOS. Fecal acetate (P = 0.030), propionate (P = 0.035), and total short-chain fatty acid (P = 0.016) concentrations increased in pectin-supplemented cats. Fecal butyrate (P = 0.010), isobutyrate (P = 0.011), isovalerate (P = 0.012), valerate (P = 0.026), and total branched-chain fatty acids + valerate (P = 0.008) concentrations increased with supplementation of FOS and pectin. Fecal cadaverine (P &lt; 0.001) and tryptamine (P &lt; 0.001) concentrations increased with supplementation of FOS and pectin. Fecal tyramine concentrations decreased (P = 0.039) in FOS-supplemented cats, whereas spermidine concentrations increased (P &lt; 0.001) in pectin-supplemented cats. Whereas fecal concentrations of putrescine (P &lt; 0.001) and total biogenic amines (P &lt; 0.001) increased with FOS and pectin, the concentrations of these compounds were increased (P &lt; 0.001) in cats supplemented with pectin. Fecal Bifidobacterium spp. concentrations increased (P = 0.006) and Escherichia coli concentrations decreased (P &lt; 0.001) in FOS-supplemented cats. Fecal concentrations of Clostridium perfringens (P &lt; 0.001), E. coli (P &lt; 0.001), and Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.030) also increased in pectin-supplemented cats. In addition to increasing populations of protein-fermenting microbiota, pectin increased production of fermentative end products associated with carbohydrate compared with protein fermentation. Pectin and FOS may be useful fiber sources in promoting intestinal health of the cat.</str>

      <str>Hybridomas were prepared from mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells derived from female BALB/c mice that had been immunized with a partially purified ethanol-induced rat liver cytochrome P-450 (P-450et). Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced by the hybridomas were screened for binding to P-450et with a radioimmunoassay. Thirty-one independent hybrid clones produced MAbs that had a high affinity for P-450et. Each clone produced MAbs of a single subclass of the mouse immunoglobulins IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, or IgA. Ten of the 31 MAbs also immunoprecipitated P-450et as determined by Ouchterlony double-immunodiffusion analyses. One of the MAbs was tested for cross-reactivity with other rabbit and rat liver cytochromes P-450 and was found not to cross-react with rat liver P-450 induced by either phenobarbital, beta-naphthoflavone, or rabbit liver P-450LM2 or P-450LM4. Nine of the MAbs were tested for cross-reactivity with rat liver clofibrate-induced P-450, rat liver pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile-induced P-450, and a human liver P-450. All the MAbs showed no cross-reactivity except for one MAb which cross-reacted with both pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile and human P-450 and three MAbs which cross-reacted with human P-450. Three antigen-precipitating MAbs and four nonprecipitating MAbs were tested for their effects on the aniline p-hydroxylase activity of liver microsomes of untreated rats and from rats treated with acetone, pyrazole, methylpyrazole, or imidazole. One of the seven MAbs tested, 1-91-3, inhibited enzyme activity of acetone-, pyrazole-, or methylpyrazole-induced microsomes by 54, 47, and 48%, respectively. This indicates that at least 50% of microsomal cytochrome P-450 aniline p-hydroxylase activity in the latter is a function of a P-450 enzyme that contained the epitope to which the MAb 1-91-3 is directed. With untreated and imidazole-induced microsomes, 32 and 21% inhibition of the enzyme activity was observed. In reconstituted systems containing phospholipid and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, MAb 1-91-3 inhibited aniline p-hydroxylase activity of purified ethanol-induced P-450et and acetone-induced P-450 by more than 90%. Nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity of acetone-induced rat microsomes was inhibited by the various MAbs up to 77% and the activity of the purified acetone-induced P-450 was inhibited up to 92%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Obesity is strongly associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may be an independent risk factor; however, limited data are available on obesity intervention in patients with CAD. We studied 588 consecutive patients, including 235 (40%) who were obese by body mass index criteria (body mass index &gt; or = 27.3 kg/m2 in women and &gt; or = 27.8 kg/m2 in men) before and after out-patient phase II cardiac rehabilitation to determine the effects of this therapy and weight reduction on exercise capacity, CAD risk factors, behavioral characteristics, and quality of life in obese patients with CAD. At baseline, obese patients were younger (p &lt; 0.0001) and had more systemic hypertension (p &lt; 0.01), and diabetes mellitus (p &lt; 0.05) and higher percent body fat (p &lt; 0.0001), total cholesterol (p = 0.02), triglycerides (p &lt; 0.0001), fasting glucose (p = 0.04), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p &lt; 0.0001), but had lower HDL cholesterol (p &lt; 0.01) and exercise capacity (p = 0.07) than patients not classified as obese. After rehabilitation, obese patients had significant improvements in body mass index (-2%; p &lt; 0.0001), percent body fat (-5%; p &lt; 0.0001), exercise capacity (+27%; p &lt; 0.0001), HDL cholesterol (+4%; p &lt; 0.01), LDL/HDL ratio (-6%; p &lt; 0.01), as well as scores for anxiety (p &lt; 0.0001), depression (p &lt; 0.01), somatization (p &lt; 0.0001) and quality of life (p &lt; 0.0001); nonobese patients, however, had significantly greater improvements in exercise capacity (+39% vs +27%; p &lt; 0.001). In a subgroup of 45 obese patients with &gt; or = 5% weight reduction, improvements in exercise capacity (p &lt; 0.001), total cholesterol (p = 0.03), triglycerides (p &lt; 0.01), HDL cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.02), and LDL/HDL ratio (p &lt; 0.0001) were greater than improvements in 81 obese patients who did not lose weight. These data indicate that greater emphasis on more successful weight reduction programs is needed to further enhance CAD risk reduction in the 40% CAD patients with obesity.</str>

      <str>The expression of the MDR-1-encoded P-170 glycoprotein (P-170) associated with clinical multidrug resistance (MDR) was investigated in 52 consecutive patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). P-170 expression was analyzed in correlation with CD34 expression and clinical response. Thirty of 52 patients expressed P-170 (58%). Eight of 30 P-170+ as compared with 16 of 22 P-170- patients achieved a complete remission (CR) (27% v 73%, P = .003). In 21 of 30 P-170+ patients, expression of the CD34 antigen was observed in greater than 10% of the blast cells, as compared with 14 of 22 P-170- patients (70% v 64%, P &gt; .05). The CR rate of CD34+ and CD34- patients was 31% and 76%, respectively (P = .006). In AMLs that simultaneously expressed both P-170 and CD34, the CR rate was worse as compared with those negative for P-170 and CD34 (5% v 63%, P = .004). In 12 patients (8 P-170+, 4 P-170-) CD34 and P-170 expression were further characterized by double fluorescence studies. It was shown that P-170+ cells were largely, but not exclusively, restricted to the CD34+ cell population. For the 8 P-170+ AML samples, the median ratio of P-170+/P-170- in CD34+ cells was 4.845 (range, 0.60 to 25.00) as compared with 0.135 (range, 0.02 to 0.67) in CD34- cells. In these 12 AML samples, the presence of functional resistance as defined by reduced daunorubicin accumulation was evaluated in CD34+ and CD34- AML cells. In 8 of 8 P-170+ patients, intracellular daunorubicin accumulation in CD34+ AML blast cells was lower than in CD34- cells, and it increased after cyclosporin addition. No difference of intracellular daunorubicin accumulation was observed between CD34+ and CD34- AML cells of 4 P-170- patients. These data indicate that P-170 expression in AML with a heterogeneous CD34+ phenotype seems predominantly present in CD34+ AML blast cells.</str>

The pretherapeutic GPS was calculated as follows: patients with elevated C-reactive protein serum levels (&gt;10 mg/L) and hypoalbuminemia (&lt;35 g/L) were allocated a score of 2, and patients with 1 or no abnormal value were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively. The association between GPS and survival was evaluated by univariate log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression models. The GPS was correlated with clinicopathologic parameters as shown by performing chi2 tests.</str>

      <str>Phosphate utilization by fish is an important issue because of its critical roles in fish growth and aquatic environmental pollution. High dietary phosphorus (P) levels typically decrease the efficiency of P utilization, thereby increasing the amount of P excreted as metabolic waste in effluents emanating from rainbow trout aquaculture. In mammals, vitamin D3 is a known regulator of P utilization but in fish, its regulatory role is unclear. Moreover, the effects of dietary P and vitamin D3 on expression of enzymatic and transport systems potentially involved in phosphate utilization are little known. We therefore monitored production of effluent P, levels of plasma vitamin D3 metabolites, as well as expression of phosphatases and the sodium phosphate cotransporter (NaPi2) in trout fed semipu diets that varied in dietary P and vitamin D3 levels. Mean soluble P concentrations varied markedly with dietary P but not with vitamin D3, and constituted 40-70% of total effluent P production by trout. Particulate P concentrations accounted for 25-50% of effluent P production, but did not vary with dietary P or vitamin D3. P in settleable wastes accounted for &lt;10% of effluent P. The stronger effect of dietary P on effluent P levels is paralleled by its striking effects on phosphatases and NaPi2. The mRNA abundance of the intestinal and renal sodium phosphate transporters increased in fish fed low dietary P; vitamin D3 had no effect. Low-P diets reduced plasma phosphate concentrations. Intracellular phytase activity increased but brushborder alkaline phosphatase activity decreased in the intestine, pyloric caeca, and gills of trout fed diets containing low dietary P. Vitamin D3 had no effect on enzyme activities. Moreover, plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were unaffected by dietary P and vitamin D3 levels. The major regulator of P metabolism, and ultimately of levels of P in the effluent from trout culture, is dietary P.</str>

      <str>A PCR method involving a genus-specific oligonucleotides set and Southern blot hybridization with four species-specific probes to P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale was evaluated for the detection of malaria parasites in blood samples from 101 patients with clinically suspect malaria infection imported to Italy. Plasmodium falciparum was the main species detected. As determined by microscopy, 53 (52.4%) patients had malaria and of these: 40 (75.5%) were infected with P. falciparum; 7 (13.2%) with P. vivax; 1 (1.9%) with P. ovale; 3 (5.7%) with P. malariae; 1 (1.9%) with P. vivax or P. ovale; and 1 (1.9%) with P. falciparum or P. vivax. Ninety-seven out 101 blood samples were submitted to ParaSight-F test which showed a sensitivity of 94.73%, and a specificity of 93.22%, as compared to microscopy. The PCR assay using the genus-specific oligonucleotide primer set (pg-PCR) was able to detect 53 (52.4%) infections and showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%, when compared to microscopy. The parasite species were identified by Southern blot hybridization using species-specific probes and 40 (75.5%) samples were P. falciparum positive, 5 (9.4%) P. vivax positive, 4 (7.5%) P. ovale positive, and 2 (3.8%) P. malariae positive. When the Southern blot results were compared to those of blood-film diagnosis, we observed some disagreement. In particular, compared to Southern blot, microscopy underestimated P. ovale infection; blood film analysis recognised only 1 P. ovale sample, whereas Southern blot recognised 4 P. ovale positive samples (by microscopy, 2 of these were detected as P. vivax, 1 as P. ovale or P. vivax, and the other as P. falciparum or P. vivax). Southern blot hybridization was unable to identify one P. falciparum and one P. vivax positive case detected by microscopy. We also plan to use a reference nested-PCR assay to clarify the disagreement observed between microscopy and Southern blot hybridization.</str>

      <str>Intrathecal injection of mice with substance P or its C-terminal fragments evokes a well documented behavioral syndrome characterized by caudally-directed biting and scratching. We have previously shown that repeated injections of substance P result in naloxone-sensitive desensitization to this substance P-induced behavior, possibly through interactions of N-terminal fragments of substance P with mu opiate binding sites. The present investigation tests the hypothesis that substance P metabolites play a role in the development of desensitization to substance P by using the biting and scratching behavioral paradigm. While substance P-induced behaviors are produced by as little as 1 pmol of substance P, repeated injections of 7.5 pmol at 60-s intervals was found to be the minimum dose capable of causing desensitization. The C-terminal peptides, substance P3-11 and substance P5-11, elicited substance P-like behaviors, but repeated injection of these compounds did not result in desensitization to this behavior. In contrast to C-terminal fragments, intrathecal injection of N-terminal fragments, (substance P1-4, substance P1-7 and substance P1-9), did not elicit any overt substance P-like behaviors when administered alone, but when co-administered with substance P, decreased the magnitude of substance P-induced behaviors in a dose-related fashion. Various peptidase inhibitors significantly inhibited the catabolism of co-administered substance P. Co-administration of substance P with peptidase inhibitors enhanced and prolonged the substance P-induced behavioral episode, but also prevented the development of substance P-induced desensitization. Together these results support the hypothesis that the accumulation of endogenously generated N-terminal metabolites of substance P mediate desensitization to substance P-induced behaviors in the spinal cord. Substance P metabolism may therefore decrease ongoing substance P activity both by the hydrolysis of the C-terminal portion of substance P as well as by the production of N-terminal metabolites that are capable of inhibiting the effects of substance P.</str>

      <str>A long-term randomised block field experiment was established in 1997 to study the dynamics of total P and dissolved P in the surface waters of rice fields receiving two application rates of fertiliser P and one rate of combined fertiliser and manure P. Preliminary results from the first two crops show that concentrations of both total P and dissolved P in the surface waters increased significantly following P application, especially during the first 2 weeks after application. P concentrations subsequently declined sharply within about 10 days, then declined steadily and remained almost constant from about 1 month after application. The initial increase in P concentration of surface waters was higher with increasing rate of fertiliser P, and the P concentration at the highest fertiliser rate peaked within about 1 week of application. The elevated P concentrations following fertiliser P application declined more rapidly than those following the combined application of fertiliser and manure P. When fertiliser and manure P were applied together, about 7 days later the surface water P concentrations were significantly higher than when the same rate of P (or double) was applied as fertiliser only. Disturbance of the surface soil by hand harrowing further increased the P concentrations in surface waters, with a subsequent decline to a steady value after about 1 week. Application of P fertiliser to the high P status soil in this experiment gave no crop yield response and may have increased the risk of pollution of adjacent surface waters through drainage from heavy rainfall events during the rice growing season. Therefore, fertiliser P should not be applied to such soils. If, however, fertiliser or manure P is applied, the application should be made during the dry winter to reduce P losses. Manure should be applied with particular care because of the higher risk of P losses to surface water arising from the relatively long period of high P concentrations in surface waters and the potential for greater release of P to field surface waters from the soil. Hand harrowing should also be avoided during wet weather to protect water quality.</str>

Purified P-4506 beta-1, P-4506 beta-2, P-4506 beta-3, and P-4506 beta-4 had apparent molecular weights of 52,000, 51,000, 52,000, and 52,500 as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Absolute spectra revealed that all four P-450 forms had characteristic low-spin spectral patterns in their fully oxidized states. P-4506 beta-1 and P-4506 beta-3 displayed spectra of the reduced carbonyl complex with lambda max at 447 nm. P-4506 beta-2 and P-4506 beta-4 showed lambda max at 446 and 448 nm, respectively. Antibodies raised against each P-450 recognized all forms, although differences were observed with respect to the extents of cross-reactivities on Western blots. Form-specific peptide fragments were also detected among the four P-450 proteins after partial protease-digestion. P-4506 beta-1 was identical to P-4506 beta-3 in the first 26 residues of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, but differed by 13 residues from P-4506 beta-2. The amino-terminal sequence of P-4506 beta-2 was unique and was not identical with those of any rat P-450 previously reported.

      <str>The scale and chronology of the phosphorus (P) enrichment of Lough Neagh, a large hypertrophic lake, was assessed using, as enrichment proxies, published palaeocological studies on diatoms and chironomid head capsules preserved in the lake sediments and, from 1974, monitoring data from the lake and its inflowing rivers. Enrichment commenced in 1880, and the scale and chronology of the diatom and chironomid records were similar up to 1960, but in the 1960s, chironomid accumulation rates increased dramatically, whereas diatom rates remained unchanged. From subsequent lake monitoring, the absence of a diatom response after 1960 was attributed to silica limitation so that P could be considered as the driver of increased diatom production only up to 1960. Using a coefficient for the demand for P by diatoms of 4 microg P mg SiO(2)(-1), it was calculated that the increased diatom production between 1881 and 1961 required an increase in lake P of 26 microg P l(-1). This value is close to the predicted increase of 22.5 microg P l(-1) in the lake caused by inputs of P from sewage treatment works and septic tanks. There was no evidence that diffuse source P contributed to enrichment over this period. Enrichment up to 1960 appears modest in comparison to subsequent years. From 1961 to 1974, lake P was estimated to have increased by 62 microg P l(-1), but only 25 microg P l(-1) of this increase was attributable to greater loadings of P from urban and septic tank sources. The enrichment response of chironomids at this time was also much greater than expected from a regression-derived relationship between urban P inputs and chironomid accumulation rates suggesting additional sources of P. The larger than expected increase in lake P was attributed to the onset of a significant internal loading of P and the commencement of an increase in diffuse source loadings of P. River monitoring has shown that diffuse P has increased steadily since 1974, more than counterbalancing a 40% reduction in urban P loadings that has taken place since 1980. By the end of the 20th century urban sources contributed only 19.7% of inflow P to Lough Neagh but lake P was 145 microg P l(-1) compared to an estimated concentration of 20 microg P l(-1) in 1881. Failure to control diffuse P sources has therefore been instrumental in the continued increase of lake P in Lough Neagh.</str>

      <str>Abdominal fat tissue samples from the general population of Greenland and from southern Denmark were analyzed for o,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene], p,p,-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane], o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], lindane (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane), aldrin (1,2,3,4,10,10-hexachloro-1,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-endo-exo-1,4:5,8-dimethanonaphthalene), dieldrin (1,2,3,4,10,10-hexachloro-6,7-epoxy-1,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-endo-exo-1,4:5,8-dimethanonaphthalene), heptachlor (1,4,5,6,7,8,8-heptachloro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoindene), heptachlor epoxide, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Fat tissue from Greenlanders contained significantly higher amounts of p,p'-DDE (p less than or equal to 0.05), p,p'-DDT (p less than or equal to 0.01), and total DDT (SIGMA DDT, the sum of DDT and its metabolites) (p less than or equal to 0.01) than southern Danes. Lindane, aldrin-like residue, dieldrin heptachlor-like residue, heptachlor epoxide, and PCBs were present in adipose tissue of both groups and there were no significant differences between the groups. The p,p'-DDE level in Greenland was lower than that in the United States, eastern Europe, and India. Among Greenlanders of different ages the highest sigma DDT was found in the age group of 22-45 yr; the content of PCBs increased with age. Among southern Danes the highest sigma DDT was found in a higher age group than in Greenlanders. Among Greenlanders the content of aldrin-like residue decreased with age and that of dieldrin increased with age. A significant correlation was found (on the basis of wet weight) between p,p'-DDE and PCB content in southern Danes (p less than or equal to 0.02). The correlation between sigma DDT and PCB content was also significant in this population (p less than or equal to 0.01). These two relationships were not significantly correlated for the Greenlanders. The DDE/PCB and sigma DDT/PCB ratios were higher in Greenlanders than in southern Danes. These ratios are age-dependent and are highest in the age group 22-45 yr among the Greenlanders. A low DDE/PCB ratio and a low sigma DDT/PCB ratio have been proposed as markers for industrialization. In Greenlanders p,p'-DDE represented about 70% of sigma DDT. For southern Danes this level was about 90%. The data obtained are presented and discussed on the basis of both lipid and wet weight levels.</str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gradients (0, 2, and 7%) on biomechanical parameters during racewalking (RW) at iso-efficiency speed (IES). During the experiment, 12 high-level athletes performed at IES on different slopes. The parameters studied were surface muscular activity (EMG) of 5 muscles of the leg using Muscle Lab (Boscosystem); kinematic parameters were collected using a high-speed camera (210 Hz) analyzed with Dartfish 5.5 Pro; and heart rate (HR) was monitored with a Cardio Polar. The results showed step length (SL), step frequency (SF), and internal work (WINT) decreased with increased treadmill gradient: SL = ([0-2% = 3.48%, p = 0.158], [0-7% = 12.17%, p &lt; 0.001]); SF = ([0-2% = 2.38%, p = 0.173], [0-7% = 6.07%, p &lt; 0.01]); WINT = ([0-2% = 8.34%, p &lt; 0.001], [0-7% = 22.81%, p &lt; 0.0001]). Conversely, contact time (CT) and HR increased less significantly with the increased gradients: CT = ([0-2% = 2.46%, p = 0.198], [0-7% = 6.56%, p &lt; 0.01]); HR = ([0-2% = 0.62%, p = 0.652], [0-7% = 3.25%, p &lt; 0.05]). The knee angle (KE) increased, whereas ankle angle (AK) and hip angle (HP) decreased with the increased gradients: AK = ([0-2% = 1.69%, p &lt; 0.001], [0-7% = 1.13%, p &lt; 0.01]); HP = ([0-2% = 0.22%, p &lt; 0.03], [0-7% = 0.16%, p = 0.456]); KE = ([0-2% = 1.01%, p &lt; 0.001], [0-7% = 1.60%, p &lt; 0.001]). Electromyography (EMG) significantly decreased with the increased gradients in the: tibialis anterior ([0-2% = 22.49%, p &lt; 0.0001], [0-7% = 41.18%, p &lt; 0.0001]) and rectus femoris ([0-2% = 15.35%, p &lt; 0.0001], [0-7% = 29.13%, p&lt; 0.0001]). In contrast, EMG activity was significantly increased in the vastus lateralis ([0-2% = 22.95%, p &lt; 0.0001], [0-7% = 31.15%, p &lt; 0.0001]), gastrocnemius medialis ([0-2% = 21.40%, p &lt; 0.001], [0-7% = 48.37%, p &lt; 0.0001]), and biceps femoris ([0-2% = 190.78%, p &lt; 0.0001], [0-7% = 201.37%, p &lt; 0.0001]). The results indicate that increasing the gradient to 2% did not elicit an increased HR in racewalkers; however, at a 7% gradient, greater muscle activity was required.</str>

      <str>Cellular oxidative stress and energy failure were shown to be involved in Glutamate (L-Glu) neurotoxicity, whereas, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) and ±DL-α-lipoic acid (LA) are known to be key players in the mitochondrial energy production. To evaluate the effects of the above antioxidants, adult rats were pretreated with ALCAR (100 mg/kg i.p for 21 days) and both ALCAR and LA (100 mg/kg i.p + 50 mg/kg i.p for 21 days), before stereotactically administering L-Glu bolus (1 μmole/1 μl) in the cerebral cortex. Results showed that acute L-Glu increased ROS (P &lt; 0.001), LPO (P &lt; 0.001), Ca(2+) (P &lt; 0.001), TNF-α (P &lt; 0.001), IFN-γ (P &lt; 0.001), NO (P &lt; 0.001) levels and mRNA expression of Caspase-3, Casapase-9, iNOS, and nNOS genes with respect to saline-injected control group. Key antioxidant parameters such as SOD, CAT, GSH, GR along with mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Ψ∆m) were decreased (P &lt; 0.05), while ALCAR pretreatment prevented these effects by significantly inhibiting ROS (P &lt; 0.001), LPO (P &lt; 0.001), Ca(2+) (P &lt; 0.05), TNF-α (P &lt; 0.05), IFN-γ (P &lt; 0.001), NO (P &lt; 0.01) levels and expression of the above genes. This chronic pretreatment of ALCAR also increased SOD, CAT, GSH, GR, and Ψ∆m (P &lt; 0.0.01, P &lt; 0.0.01, P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.05, and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) with respect to L: -Glu group. The addition of LA to ALCAR resulted in further increases in CAT (P &lt; 0.05), GSH (P &lt; 0.01), GR (P &lt; 0.05), Ψ∆m (P &lt; 0.05) and additional decreases in ROS (P &lt; 0.001), LPO (P &lt; 0.05), Ca(2+) (P &lt; 0.05), TNF-α (P &lt; 0.05) and mRNA expression of iNOS and nNOS genes with respect to ALCAR group. Hence, this "one-two punch" of ALCAR + LA may help in ameliorating the deleterious cellular events that occur after L-Glu.</str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to assess retrospectively the influence of the size of cervical cancer brachytherapy applicators (ovoids and uterine tandems) on pelvic dose distribution and to analyze the impact of various patient- and disease-related factors on applicators' geometry and on dose distribution in particular applications.</str>
      <str>The subject of this study were 356 cervical cancer patients treated with Selectron LDR as a part of their radical radiotherapy. Analyzed factors included patient age, weight, number of vaginal deliveries, and disease stage.</str>
      <str>The use of larger vaginal applicators resulted in lower bladder and rectum doses and in higher point B doses (all p &lt; 0.0001); longer uterine tandems produced lower rectum doses and higher point B doses (both p &lt; 0.0001). Increasing patient age and disease stage resulted in a decreased frequency of use of large ovoids (both p &lt; 0.0001) and of long tandems (age: p = 0.0069, stage: p = 0.004). As a result, higher doses to bladder (age: p &lt; 0.0001, stage: p = 0.017) and rectum (age: p = 0.037, stage: p = 0.011) were observed. Increasing age also resulted in lower point B doses (p &lt; 0.0001). Increasing patient weight correlated with less frequent use of long tandems (p = 0.0015) and with higher bladder doses (p = 0.04). Higher number of vaginal deliveries was related to the increase in the use of long tandems (p = 0.002); in patients who had had at least one vaginal delivery, point B doses were significantly higher (p = 0.0059). In multivariate analysis ovoid size and uterine tandem length were dependent on patient age (respectively: p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001), disease stage (respectively: p = 0.003 and p = 0.008) and on the number of vaginal deliveries (respectively: p = 0.07 and p = 0.008). Doses to critical organs and to points B were dependent on patient age (respectively: p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.011, and p &lt; 0.001) and on disease stage (respectively: p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.004, and p = 0.048).</str>

      <str>High P-efficiency (IS-22-30, IS-22-25) and low P-efficiency (IS-07-07) wild barley cultivars were chosen to evaluate characteristics of phosphorus uptake and utilization, and properties of phosphorus fractions in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere in a pot experiment with 0 (CK) and 30 mg P · kg(-1) supplied as only Pi (KH2PO4), only Po (phytate) or Pi + Po (KH2PO4+ phytate). The results showed that dry matter and phosphorus accumulation of wild barley in the different treatments was ranked as Pi &gt; Pi + Po &gt; Po &gt; CK. In addition, dry matter yield and phosphorus uptake of wild barley with high P-efficiency exhibited significantly greater than that with low P-efficiency. The concentration of soil available phosphorus was significantly different after application of different phosphorus sources, which was presented as Pi &gt; Pi + Po &gt; Po. The concentration of soil available phosphorus in high P-efficiency wild barley was significantly higher than that of low P-efficiency in the rhizosphere soil. There was a deficit in rhizosphere available phosphorus of high P-efficiency wild barley, especially in Pi and Pi+Po treatments. The inorganic phosphorus fractions increased with the increasing Pi treatment, and the concentrations of inorganic phosphorus fractions in soil were sorted as follows: Ca10-P &gt; O-P &gt; Fe-P &gt; Al-P &gt; Ca2-P &gt; Ca8-P. The contents of Ca2-P and Ca8-P for high P-efficiency wild barley showed deficits in rhizosphere soil under each phosphorus source treatment. In addition, enrichment of Al-P and Fe-P was observed in Pi treatment in rhizosphere soil. The concentrations of organic phosphorus fractions in soil were sorted as follows: moderate labile organic phosphorus &gt; moderate resistant, resistant organic phosphorus &gt; labile organic phosphorus. The labile and moderate labile organic phosphorus enriched in rhizosphere soil and the greatest enrichment appeared in Pi treatment. Furthermore, the concentrations of moderate resistant organic phosphorus and resistant organic phosphorus decreased in rhizosphere soil. The concentrations of labile and moderate labile organic phosphorus in rhizosphere soil of high P-efficiency wild barley were significantly higher than that of low P-efficiency wild barley in each phosphorus source treatment. However, moderate resistant organic phosphorus and resistant organic phosphorus concentrations had no significant difference between the two genotypes. Wild barley with high P-efficiency demonstrated a greater ability of mobilization and uptake Ca2-P, Ca8-P, Al-P and labile organic phosphorus than that with low P-efficiency under Pi deficiency.</str>

      <str>We prepared primary monolayer cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and measured the losses of cytochromes P-450 with the use of specific antibodies directed against purified forms of hepatic cytochrome P-450 which predominate in untreated rats (P-450UT-A, P-450UT-F) or in rats treated with phenobarbital (P-450PB-B/D, P-450PB-C, P-450PB/PCN-E) or with 3-methylcholanthrene (P-450 beta NF-B, P-450 beta NF/ISF-G). In hepatocytes prepared from an untreated rat and incubated in control medium, total cytochrome P-450, measured spectrally as CO-binding hemoprotein, declined 68% during the first 72 hr in culture. However, the sum of the immunoreactive cytochromes P-450 declined only 24%, indicating that loss of heme rather than of protein accounts for much of the well-known loss of cytochromes P-450 in hepatocyte cultures. In cultures prepared from untreated rats or from rats treated with phenobarbital or with 3-methylcholanthrene, individual forms of cytochrome P-450 declined at markedly differing rates. Incubation of cultures in three different media previously reported to maintain levels of total cytochrome P-450 failed to prevent the decline in total cytochrome P-450 during the first 24 to 72 hr in culture. However, in cultures incubated in medium containing metyrapone, the level of holocytochrome P-450 was maintained at the initial value during the first 72 hr, apparently by preventing the net loss of cytochrome P-450 heme and by increasing the concentrations of immunoreactive P-450PB/PCN-E and P-450 beta NF-B. Medium containing nicotinamide increased the proportion of P-450 beta NF-B relative to the other forms of cytochrome P-450, whereas cysteine-free medium increased P-450UT-F. We conclude that loss of cytochrome P-450 in cultured hepatocytes involves loss of its heme moiety coupled with changes in the concentrations of the individual forms. Recognition of these changes as influenced by specific components of the culture medium is important when using primary hepatocyte cultures for study of xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity in the liver.</str>

      <str>While Malaysia has had great success in controlling Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, notifications of Plasmodium malariae and the microscopically near-identical Plasmodium knowlesi increased substantially over the past decade. However, whether this represents microscopic misdiagnosis or increased recognition of P. knowlesi has remained uncertain.</str>
      <str>To describe the changing epidemiology of malaria in Sabah, in particular the increasing incidence of P. knowlesi, a retrospective descriptive study was undertaken involving a review of Department of Health malaria notification data from 2012-2013, extending a previous review of these data from 1992-2011. In addition, malaria PCR and microscopy data from the State Public Health Laboratory were reviewed to estimate the accuracy of the microscopy-based notification data.</str>
      <str>Notifications of P. malariae/P. knowlesi increased from 703 in 2011 to 815 in 2012 and 996 in 2013. Notifications of P. vivax and P. falciparum decreased from 605 and 628, respectively, in 2011, to 297 and 263 in 2013. In 2013, P. malariae/P. knowlesi accounted for 62% of all malaria notifications compared to 35% in 2011. Among 1,082 P. malariae/P. knowlesi blood slides referred for PCR testing during 2011-2013, there were 924 (85%) P. knowlesi mono-infections, 30 (2.8%) P. falciparum, 43 (4.0%) P. vivax, seven (0.6%) P. malariae, six (0.6%) mixed infections, 31 (2.9%) positive only for Plasmodium genus, and 41 (3.8%) Plasmodium-negative. Plasmodium knowlesi mono-infection accounted for 32/156 (21%) and 33/87 (38%) blood slides diagnosed by microscopy as P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Twenty-six malaria deaths were reported during 2010-2013, including 12 with 'P. malariae/P. knowlesi' (all adults), 12 with P. falciparum (seven adults), and two adults with P. vivax.</str>
      <str>Notifications of P. malariae/P. knowlesi in Sabah are increasing, with this trend likely reflecting a true increase in incidence of P. knowlesi and presenting a major threat to malaria control and elimination in Malaysia. With the decline of P. falciparum and P. vivax, control programmes need to incorporate measures to protect against P. knowlesi, with further research required to determine effective interventions.</str>

      <str>Gas-vesicle (Vac) synthesis in Halobacterium salinarium PHH1 involves the expression of the p-vac region consisting of 14 different gvp genes that are arranged in two clusters: p-gvpACNO and, oppositely oriented, p-gvpDEFGHIJKLM. The latter cluster of genes is transcribed as two units: p-gvpDE and p-gvpF-M. The 5'-terminus of the p-gvpF-M mRNA was located 169 nucleotides upstream of p-gvpF within p-gvpE. The p-gvpG and p-gvpK gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and antibodies to proteins obtained were raised in rabbits. Both proteins could be detected in halobacterial cell lysates; in gas-vesicle preparations, however, neither GvpG nor GvpK could be found. The requirement for single p-gvp gene expression for gas-vesicle synthesis was determined by transformation experiments using the Vac- species Haloferax volcanii as recipient. Construct delta A containing all p-gvp genes except for p-gvpA, encoding the major gas-vesicle structural protein, produced Vac- transformants, but the addition of p-gvpA on a second vector restored gas-vesicle synthesis to wild-type level (Vac++). Similarly, double transformants containing p-gvpD-M plus p-gvpACNO, or p-gvpG-M (fused to the promoter of the halobacterial ferredoxin gene for expression) plus p-gvpFED-ACNO were Vac++. Transformants containing the p-vac region either lacking gvpA, gvpF, or gvpGHI were Vac-, indicating the absolute requirement of these gvp genes (or at least one in the case of gvpGHI) for gas-vesicle formation. Double transformants containing the constructs p-gvpF-M plus p-gvpACNO (delta DE) accumulated gas vesicles (Vac+) but synthesized fewer than the wild type, showing that the p-gvpDE genes are not necessary for gas-vesicle assembly. A repressor function affecting the synthesis of the p-gvpF-M mRNA could be suggested for p-gvpD and the 5'-region of its mRNA.</str>

      <str>Two experiments were conducted to determine the available P requirements of grower and grower/finisher pigs and to define the conditions for conducting a growth assay for P availability. In the first experiment, diets with four levels of calculated available P (1-4 g/kg) and four Ca:available P ratios (1.7-2.9) were used to determine the available P requirements of grower pigs. The diets were formulated by substituting the required amounts of limestone and sodium tripolyphosphate for sugar in a soya-bean meal and sugar-based diet. In addition to measuring growth responses, a range of bones were examined to determine the most suitable criteria for assessing the response to available P. There was a small quadratic response of feed intake and growth rate of the pigs to level of available P, with maximum responses occurring to approximately 3 g available P/kg (P &lt; 0.05). There were linear depressing effects of increasing Ca:available P ratios on carcass gain and feed conversion ratio (P &lt; 0.01) but most of these effects occurred when the ratio exceeded 2.5:1. All bone variables examined increased linearly (P &lt; 0.05) or curvilinearly (P &lt; 0.01) with increasing available P concentration. In general, these variables were not affected by the Ca:available P ratio. The results of the growth responses and bone development indicate that the grower pig requires approximately 3 g available P/kg. However, for availability assays, where linearity of response is needed, the dietary concentration of available P should be a maximum of approximately 2 g/kg. In the second experiment four levels of calculated available P (1-4 g/kg) with a Ca:available P ratio of 2.5:1 were used to determine the available P requirements of grower/finisher pigs from 20 to 90 kg live weight. At 50 kg live weight the dietary available P concentration for half the pigs fed at 2, 3 and 4 g available P/kg was reduced to 1, 2 and 3 g/kg respectively. The pigs were fed ad lib, and growth performance, bone characteristics, P retention and ash concentration in the empty body were taken as response criteria to assess P adequacy. Among the variables tested, the ash concentration in the radius/ulna bone and P and ash concentrations in the empty body appeared to be more responsive than other variables to the changes in dietary P levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Cattail (Typha domingensis) has been spreading in phosphorus (P) enriched areas of the oligotrophic Florida Everglades at the expense of sawgrass (Cladium mariscus spp. jamaicense). Abundant evidence in the literature explains how the opportunistic features of Typha might lead to a complete dominance in P-enriched areas. Less clear is how Typha can grow and acquire P at extremely low P levels, which prevail in the unimpacted areas of the Everglades.</str>
      <str>Apparent P uptake kinetics were measured for intact plants of Cladium and Typha acclimated to low and high P at two levels of oxygen in hydroponic culture. The saturated rate of P uptake was higher in Typha than in Cladium and higher in low-P acclimated plants than in high-P acclimated plants. The affinity for P uptake was two-fold higher in Typha than in Cladium, and two- to three-fold higher for low-P acclimated plants compared to high-P acclimated plants. As Cladium had a greater proportion of its biomass allocated to roots, the overall uptake capacity of the two species at high P did not differ. At low P availability, Typha increased biomass allocation to roots more than Cladium. Both species also adjusted their P uptake kinetics, but Typha more so than Cladium. The adjustment of the P uptake system and increased biomass allocation to roots resulted in a five-fold higher uptake per plant for Cladium and a ten-fold higher uptake for Typha.</str>
      <str>Both Cladium and Typha adjust P uptake kinetics in relation to plant demand when P availability is high. When P concentrations are low, however, Typha adjusts P uptake kinetics and also increases allocation to roots more so than Cladium, thereby improving both efficiency and capacity of P uptake. Cladium has less need to adjust P uptake kinetics because it is already efficient at acquiring P from peat soils (e.g., through secretion of phosphatases, symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, nutrient conservation growth traits). Thus, although Cladium and Typha have qualitatively similar strategies to improve P-uptake efficiency and capacity under low P-conditions, Typha shows a quantitatively greater response, possibly due to a lesser expression of these mechanisms than Cladium. This difference between the two species helps to explain why an opportunistic species such as Typha is able to grow side by side with Cladium in the P-deficient Everglades.</str>

      <str>Ab initio MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ calculations have been carried out to investigate the pnicogen bonded complexes formed between the acids O═PH3, S═PH3, HN═PH3, and H2C═PH3 and the bases NH3, NCH, N2, PH3, and PCH. All nitrogen and phosphorus bases form complexes in which the bases are lone pair electron donors. The binding energies of complexes involving the stronger bases NH3, NCH, and PH3 differentiate among the acids, but the binding energies of complexes with the weaker bases do not. These complexes are stabilized by charge transfer from the lone pair orbital of N or P to the σ*P═A orbital of X═PH3, where A is the atom of X directly bonded to P. PCH also forms complexes with the X═PH3 acids as a π electron donor to the σ*P═A orbital. The binding energies and the charge-transfer energies of the π complexes are greater than those of the complexes in which PCH is a lone pair donor. Whether the positive charge on P increases, decreases, or remains the same upon complex formation, the chemical shieldings of (31)P decrease in the complexes relative to the corresponding monomers. (1p)J(P-N) and (1p)J(P-P) values correlate best with the corresponding P-N and P-P distances as a function of the nature of the base. (1)J(P-A) values do not correlate with P-A distances. Rather, the absolute values of (1)J(P-O), (1)J(P-S), and (1)J(P-N) decrease upon complexation. Decreasing (1)J(P-A) values correlate linearly with increasing complex binding energies. In contrast, (1)J(P-C) values increase upon complexation and correlate linearly with increasing binding energies. </str>

      <str>Agosterol A (AG-A) is a novel agent that reverses P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1)-meditated multidrug resistance (MDR). We have synthesized [125I]11-azidophenyl agosterol A (azidoAG-A), a photoaffinity analog of AG-A, and characterized its binding to P-gp in membrane vesicles prepared from multidrug-resistant P-gp-overexpressing KB-C2 cells. The photoanalog photolabeled intact P-gp and both the N- and C-terminal fragments of P-gp. [125I]AzidoAG-A is transported by P-gp and the intracellular accumulation of both [125I]azidoAG-A and [3H]AG-A in KB-C2 cells was lower than that in the parental drug-sensitive KB-3-1 cells. [125I]AzidoAG-A bound to the drug binding site(s) on P-gp because photoaffinity labeling of P-gp was inhibited by a variety of known P-gp substrates, including anticancer, reversing, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents. The binding of [125I]azidoAG-A to P-gp differs from the binding of other photolabeled probes such as iodoaryl-azidoprazosin (IAAP) to P-gp and from the binding of [125I]azidoAG-A to MRP1 based on the differing effects of flupentixol and glutathione (GSH) on their binding. Thus, [125I]azidoAG-A will be a useful tool to elucidate the structure and function of P-gp because it directly binds to the drug binding site(s) on P-gp, is transported by P-gp, and exhibits different P-gp binding characteristics than IAAP.</str>

      <str>Given the nucleophilicity of the [Pt(2)S(2)] ring, the evolution of [Pt(2)(mu-S)(2)(P intersection P)(2)] (P intersection P=1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe), 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp)) metalloligands in the presence of the simplest electrophilic species, the proton, has been studied. Combined use of experimental and theoretical data has allowed the whole set of reactions ensuing the protonation of the [Pt(2)S(2)] core to be established. The titration of [Pt(2)(mu-S)(2)(P intersection P)(2)] with HCl or HClO(4) was monitored mainly by (31)P[(1)H] NMR and mass techniques. Characterization of all the species involved was completed with the determination of the crystal structure of [Pt(SH)(2)(P intersection P)], for dppe and dppp, and [Pt(3)(mu(3)-S)(2)(dppp)(3)](PF(6))(2). The first protonation step of the [Pt(2)S(2)] core leads to the stable [Pt(2)(mu-S)(mu-SH)(P intersection P)(2)](+) complex, but the second step implies disintegration of the ring, thus giving rise to various mononuclear species. The subsequent evolution of some of these species allows regeneration of [Pt(2)(mu-S)(mu-SH)(P intersection P)(2)](+), evidencing the cyclic nature of this process. Whereas the reaction pathway is essentially common for both phosphine ligands, dppe and dppp, the different coordinating ability of Cl(-) or ClO(4) (-) determines the nature of the final products, [PtCl(2)(P intersection P)], [Pt(3)(mu(3)-S)(2)(P intersection P)(3)]Cl(2) or [Pt(3)(mu(3)-S)(2)(P intersection P)(3)](ClO(4))(2).

      <str>To characterize the molecular basis by which imidazole antimycotic drugs increase cytochrome P-450, we examined the effects of treating female rats with clotrimazole, miconazole, or ketoconazole on expression of the major inducible forms of hepatic cytochromes P-450 (P-450p, P-450b/e, P-450c/d, and P-450j). From measurements of the content of immunoreactive cytochromes P-450 in liver microsomes and of the amounts of liver RNA hybridizing to cloned P-450 cDNAs, we established that the glucocorticoid-responsive P-450p is the form predominantly induced by clotrimazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole, to as much as 382 times above control values. The phenobarbital-responsive cytochromes P-450b/e were also induced strongly by clotrimazole and miconazole, but not by ketoconazole. Aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible cytochromes P-450c/d were modestly elevated by each of these three antifungal drugs whereas ethanol-responsive P-450j was marginally induced by ketoconazole, but not by clotrimazole or miconazole. In some, but not all cases, treatment of rats with antifungal drugs resulted in accumulation of P-450 protein that significantly exceeded the increase in the corresponding P-450 mRNA. In conclusion, imidazole antifungal drugs differentially modulate the expression of at least four distinct gene subfamilies of rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 by separate mechanisms involving accumulation of P-450 mRNA and protein.</str>

      <str>A green-house study was conducted in late 2005 to investigate the aging behavior of p,p'-DDE in two types of soil, Hydragric Anthrosols (An) and Hydragric Acrisols (Ac), according to the World Reference Base (WRB) [FAO/ISRIC/ISSS. 1998. World reference base for soil resources. World soil resources reports, Rome. p. 87]. Paddy rice and dry rice were grown in submerged paddy soils and non-submerged upland soils, respectively. The concentration of extractable p,p'-DDE in fresh DDE-spiked soils was 746.2ngg(-1). During the first few weeks of the experiment, the extractability of p,p'-DDE became increasingly low as the aging period prolonged. However, certain amount of p,p'-DDE that had been captured by soil minerals and organic matter (OM) could be released and became extractable in the later period. The extractability of p,p'-DDE in submerged soils was significantly lower than that in non-submerged soil, because flooding could increase the binding of pollutants to soil particles. The plantation of both dry rice and paddy rice slowed down the aging process of p,p'-DDE. After one month's growth of rice, p,p'-DDE bound to soil particles was released and became extractable. The OM and silt content of An are higher than that of Ac, resulting in more bound residues and relative lower extractability of p,p'-DDE in An. In addition, the extractability of p,p'-DDE could be reduced by the addition of rice straw to soils.</str>

      <str>Multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp; also known as MDR1 and ABCB1) is expressed in the luminal membrane of the small intestine and blood-brain barrier, and the apical membranes of excretory cells such as hepatocytes and kidney proximal tubule epithelia. P-gp regulates the absorption and elimination of a wide range of compounds, such as digoxin, paclitaxel, HIV protease inhibitors and psychotropic drugs. Its substrate specificity is as broad as that of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, which encompasses up to 50 % of the currently marketed drugs. There has been considerable interest in variations in the ABCB1 gene as predictors of the pharmacokinetics and/or treatment outcomes of several drug classes, including antidepressants and antipsychotics. Moreover, P-gp-mediated transport activity is saturable, and is subject to modulation by inhibition and induction, which can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety of P-gp substrates. In addition, many of the P-gp substrates overlap with CYP3A4 substrates, and several psychotropic drugs that are P-gp substrates are also CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore, psychotropic drugs that are P-gp substrates may cause a drug interaction when P-gp inhibitors and inducers are coadministered, or when psychotropic drugs or other medicines that are P-gp substrates are added to a prescription. Hence, it is clinically important to accumulate data about drug interactions through studies on P-gp, in addition to CYP3A4, to assist in the selection of appropriate psychotropic medications and in avoiding inappropriate combinations of therapeutic agents. There is currently insufficient information available on the psychotropic drug interactions related to P-gp, and therefore we summarize the recent clinical data in this review.</str>

      <str>Ab initio calculations at the MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ level have been carried out to investigate the structures and binding energies of cationic complexes involving protonated sp, sp2, and sp3 phosphorus bases as proton donor ions and the sp-hybridized phosphorus bases H-C[triple bond]P and H3C-C[triple bond]P as proton acceptors. These proton-bound complexes exhibit a variety of structural motifs, but all are stabilized by interactions that occur through the pi cloud of the acceptor base. The binding energies of these complexes range from 6 to 15 kcal/mol. Corresponding complexes with H3C-C[triple bond]P as the proton acceptor are more stable than those with H-C[triple bond]P as the acceptor, a reflection of the greater basicity of H3C-C[triple bond]P. In most complexes with sp2- or sp3-hybridized P-H donor ions, the P-H bond lengthens and the P-H stretching frequency is red-shifted relative to the corresponding monomers. Complex formation also leads to a lengthening of the C[triple bond]P bond and a red shift of the C[triple bond]P stretching vibration. The two-bond coupling constants 2pihJ(P-P) and 2pihJ(P-C) are significantly smaller than 2hJ(P-P) and 2hJ(P-C) for complexes in which hydrogen bonding occurs through lone pairs of electrons on P or C. This reflects the absence of significant s electron density in the hydrogen-bonding regions of these pi complexes.</str>

      <str>The expression of P-glycoprotein in 159 non-small cell lung cancers was immunohistochemically examined using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb C219). A total of 93 (60%) cancers were found to be positive for P-glycoprotein. The 5-year survival rates of patients with P-glycoprotein (P-gp+) and those without P-glycoprotein (P-gp-) were 47.6% and 73.6%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). According to a univariate analysis, P-gp+ was associated with a poor prognosis for males, those with stage I cancer, those who underwent complete resection, and those with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. A multivariate study using the Cox regression analysis indicated that the expression of P-glycoprotein is useful for predicting the prognosis. Among 24 patients who underwent complete resection and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, 18 were P-gp+ and the remaining 6 were P-gp-. Of the 18 with P-gp+ cancer, 11 relapsed and 9 died from tumor-related causes, while the other 7 remain free from tumor recurrence; however, all with P-gp- cancer are alive without recurrence. These observations suggest a bias toward a shorter survival for patients with P-gp+ cancer because P-glycoprotein may be associated with chemoresistance. Thus, detection of the expression of P-glycoprotein will aid in planning appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</str>

The same parameters in addition to NA predicted lymph node involvement and metastasis. Recurrence rate was significantly related to NA10 (p = 0.0250). Non-papillar growth (p = 0.002), clinical stage (p = 0.005), histological grade (p = 0.0120), NA (p = 0.0143), SDNA (0.0383) and NA10 (p = 0.0632) predicted recurrence-free period. Bladder cancer survival was related to clinical stage (p less than 0.0001), histological grade (p less than 0.0001), SDNA (p less than 0.0001), non-papillar growth (p less than 0.0001), NA (p = 0.0001) and NA 10 (p = 0.0001), in that order. Grade II tumours could be regrouped prognostically using NA (p = 0.006), SDNA (p = 0.033) and NA10 (p = 0.016) as classifiers. Clinical stage, NA and histological grade predicted bladder cancer survival in a multiparameter analysis. The results show that NA and SDNA are powerful prognosticators of survival. NA10 and SDNA predict progression better than NA. The multiparameter analysis identified clinical stage, histological grade and NA as the most important prognosticators of survival.</str>

The secreted product, however, had disulphide bonding and could be refolded to a similar structure to natural Der (nDer) p 2 after precipitation with trichloro-acetic or ammonium sulphate. ANS binding and intrinsic Trp92 fluorescence showed that all recombinant proteins were different to nDer p 2 and that the allergen secreted from P. pastoris did not form a hydrophobic cavity. Despite the marked structural changes, all preparations of Der p 2 had similar IgE binding to nDer p 2.</str>

      <str>Synthetic oligomer probes were used in hybridization experiments to investigate the developmental regulation of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) genes in rat liver. Transplacental induction by phenobarbital of P-450b and P-450e mRNAs was not detectable in fetal rat livers prior to day 21 of gestation. The levels of these mRNAs increased approximately 2-fold from gestational day 21 to day 22 in phenobarbital-induced liver. P-450b and P-450e mRNAs were shown to be adenylated and the fractions associated with polysomes were similar in both fetal and adult livers. No P-450b or P-450e mRNAs were detected in fetal lung and kidney RNA preparations regardless of pretreatment. Southern blot data utilizing fetal liver DNA suggests that responsiveness to xenobiotic induction during development is not attained by rearrangement of P-450b or P-450e genes. Experiments with probes specific for P-450c and P-450d failed to detect their respective mRNAs in fetal livers from 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC)-treated or untreated rats. Both species were detectable in 3-MC-treated rats 1 week after birth. The levels of 3-MC-inducible P-450c and P-450d mRNAs increased with age and peaked approximately 3 weeks after birth. Hepatic P-450d mRNA levels in 3-MC-treated or control rats was consistently higher than P-450c mRNA levels at all ages studied.</str>

      <str>Panax vietnamensis was discovered recently in Vietnam. Its bamboo-like rhizomes, called Vietnamese Ginseng, have attracted considerable attention because of their specific pharmacological activities. In order to define the taxonomic position of this new species and include it in the molecular authentication of Ginseng drugs, the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and matK gene sequences of P. vietnamensis were determined and compared with those of its related taxa, P. japonicus var. major and P. pseudo-ginseng subsp. himalaicus, besides previously reported P. ginseng, P. japonicus and P. quinquefolius. The 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to be 1809 bps in length. The sequence of P. vietnamensis was identical to that of P. quinquefolius, and presented one base substitution from those of both P. japonicus var. major and P. pseudo-ginseng subsp. himalaicus. The matK gene sequences of 6 taxa were found to be 1509 bps in length. The sequence of P. vietnamensis differed from those of P. japonicus var. major, P. pseudo-ginseng subsp. himalaicus, P. ginseng, P. japonicus and P. quinquefolius at 4, 5, 9, 9 and 10 nucleotide positions, respectively. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed by the combined 18S rRNA-matK gene analysis using the maximum parsimony method showed that P. vietnamensis was sympatric with other Panax species and had a close relationship with P. japonicus var. major and P. pseudo-ginseng subsp. himalaicus.</str>

      <str>One,1-dichloro-2,2 bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the major metabolite of 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT), is a known persistent organic pollutant and male reproductive toxicant. It has antiandrogenic effect. However, the mechanism by which p,p'-DDE exposure causes male reproductive toxicity remains unknown. To elucidate the mechanism underpinning the testicular effects of p,p'-DDE, we sought to investigate apoptotic effects and mRNA expression of apoptosis-associated genes in the testis of pubertal rats, including Fas, FasL, calpain-1, cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-w, Bak, and caspase-3, -8, -9, -12. Animals were administered with different doses of p,p'-DDE (0, 20, 60, 100 mg/kg body weight) every other day by intraperitoneal injection for 10 days. The results indicated that p,p'-DDE exposure at over 20 mg/kg body weight showed the induction of apoptotic cell death. p,p'-DDE could induce decrease in SOD and GSH-Px activity of serum in 60 mg/kg body weight group. Significant elevations in the mRNA levels of Fas, FasL, calpain-1, cytochrome c, Bax, Bak, and caspase-3, -8, -9, -12 were observed in testis of rat treated with p,p'-DDE. Taken together, these results lead us to speculate that in vivo exposure to p,p'-DDE might induce testicular apoptosis in pubertal rats through the involvement of Fas/FasL, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated pathways.</str>

      <str>An in vitro experiment was conducted to examine the effects of defaunation (removal of protozoa) on ruminal fermentation characteristics, CH4 production and degradation by rumen microbes when incubated with cereal grains (corn, wheat and rye). Sodium lauryl sulfate as a defaunation reagent was added into the culture solution at a concentration of 0.000375 g/ml, and incubated anaerobically for up to 12 h at 39°C. Following defaunation, live protozoa in the culture solution were rarely observed by microscopic examination. A difference in pH was found among grains regardless of defaunation at all incubation times (p&lt;0.01 to 0.001). Defaunation significantly decreased pH at 12 h (p&lt;0.05) when rumen fluid was incubated with grains. Ammonia-N concentration was increased by defaunation for all grains at 6 h (p&lt;0.05) and 12 h (p&lt;0.05) incubation times. Total VFA concentration was increased by defaunation at 6 h (p&lt;0.05) and 12 h (p&lt;0.01) for all grains. Meanwhile, defaunation decreased acetate and butyrate proportions at 6 h (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01) and 12 h (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001), but increased the propionate proportion at 3 h, 6 h and 12 h incubation (p&lt;0.01 to 0.001) for all grains. Defaunation increased in vitro effective degradability of DM (p&lt;0.05). Production of total gas and CO2 was decreased by defaunation for all grains at 1 h (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.05) and then increased at 6 h (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.05) and 12 h (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.05).

      <str>One hundred and ten patients with PAF and 87 normal controls were enrolled. Using DTI, the time intervals from the beginning of P-wave to the onset of atrioventricular ring motion related to atrial contraction were measured.</str>
      <str>Atrial electromechanical coupling at the interventricular septum atrioventricular annulus (P-A1), left lateral mitral annulus (P-A2) and right lateral tricuspid annulus (P-A3) in PAF group were significantly longer than those in control (p &lt; 0.001). The difference between P-A2 and P-A1 (T1), P-A2 and P-A3 (T3) in PAF group were greater than those in control before age correction (p &lt; 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that the duration of PAF episodes and age were the greatest influential factors of P-A1 (r = 0.564). Left atrial anterior-posterior dimension (LAD) and age were the greatest influential factors of P-A2 (r = 0.459). The LAD was the greatest influential factors of T1 and T3 (r = 0.408, 0.542).</str>
      <str>The atrial electromechanical coupling was significantly longer and the dispersion of P-A at left lateral mitral annulus was greater in PAF patients.

      <str>P-selectin is a cellular adhesion molecule that mediates the interaction of activated endothelial cells or platelets with leukocytes. Increased levels of soluble P-selectin have been reported in various cardiovascular disorders. We measured serum soluble P-selectin levels as well as 3 polymorphisms of the P-selectin gene (C-2123G, A-1969G, and Thr715Pro) in a large cohort of patients with documented coronary artery disease (n=869) and a healthy control group (n=334). The 3 P-selectin polymorphisms were strongly associated with P-selectin levels and altogether explained 7.3% and 18.6% of the P-selectin variability in patients and controls, respectively. Genotype distributions did not significantly differ between patients and controls. P-selectin levels were increased in patients younger than 55 years of age compared with controls (135.2 vs 114.3 ng/mL, P&lt;0.01). On the contrary, patients older than 65 years of age had significantly lower P-selectin levels than did controls (121.5 vs 134.7 ng/mL, P&lt;0.02). In intermediate age groups, P-selectin levels did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. In conclusion, this study revealed a strong association between P-selectin gene polymorphisms and serum P-selectin levels and a complex age-dependent relation between soluble P-selectin levels and coronary artery disease, which suggests that this molecule might have different roles in the atherothrombotic process.</str>

      <str>The Leishmania pifanoi amastigote antigen P-8 has been previously shown to induce protective immunity in a murine model of cutaneous leishmaniasis (L. Soong, S. M. Duboise, P. Kima, and D. McMahon-Pratt, Infect. Immun. 63:3559-3566, 1995). As this antigen is of interest for further vaccine studies, the biochemical characterization of P-8 was undertaken. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western-blot analysis, and gel filtration chromatography revealed that P-8 antigen consisted of two proteoglycolipid complexes. The P-8 epitope is associated with the L. pifanoi amastigote-specific glycolipid components found in the two complexes. The P-8 complex 1 (P-8c1) consists of a 56-kDa serine metalloproteinase, apolipoprotein E (derived from fetal bovine serum), and amastigote-specific glycolipids. The P-8 complex 2 (P-8c2) consists of a 31-kDa cysteine proteinase associated with amastigote glycolipids. Biochemical analyses suggest that the P-8 antigenic glycolipids may be distinct from previously described Leishmania glycolipids (glycosylinositol-phospholipids and sphingoglycolipids). Protective immunity studies revealed that P-8c1 (serine metalloproteinase-glycolipid complex) confers comparable protection against infection as immunopurified P-8. The isolated P-8c2 (cysteine proteinase-glycolipid complex) does not provide significant protection, nor does stimulation with P-8c2 result in significant T-cell activation in P-8- or P-8c2-vaccinated mice. Consequently, the P-8c1 complex appears to be the immunodominant component of P-8.</str>

      <str>Maximal concentrations of substance P and methacholine induced a rapid increase in [3H]inositol trisphosphate ([3H]IP3) formation. After about 1 min, the [3H]IP3 in the substance-P-treated cells ceased to increase further, whereas in the methacholine-treated cells [3H]IP3 continued to increase. Addition of methacholine to the substance-P-treated cells caused a rapid increase in [3H]IP3, whereas a second addition of a 10-fold excess of substance P had no effect. Pretreatment of cells with substance P, followed by removal of the substance P by washing, resulted in a decreased response to a second application of substance P. A similar protocol involving pretreatment with methacholine had no effect on subsequent responsiveness to substance P. Analysis of [3H]substance P binding to substance-P-treated cells indicated that the number of receptors for substance P was decreased, but the affinity of the receptors for substance P was unaffected. After substance P pretreatment, a prolonged incubation (2 h) restored responsiveness of the cells to substance P, measured as [3H]IP3 formation, and restored the number of binding sites to control values. These findings indicate that, in the rat parotid gland, substance P induces a homologous desensitization of its receptor, which involves a slowly reversible down-regulation or sequestration of substance-P-binding sites.</str>

We have now conducted a cell-free characterization of the enzymatic patterns responsible for these phenotypes. Microsomes from Trypanosoma cruzi, Crithidia fasciculata, Leishmania enriettii, and Blastocrithidia culicis were found to synthesize dolichol-P-[14C]Man but not dolichol-P-[14C]Glc when incubated with rat liver dolichol-P and GDP-[14C]Man or UDP-[14C]Glc, thus providing for an explanation to the absence of glucosylated dolichol-P-P derivatives. Formation of dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharides was assayed in incubation mixtures containing rat liver dolichol-P, GDP-[14C]Man, microsomes, and unlabeled Man5-8GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol from bovine liver. Membranes from species synthesizing dolichol-P-P-linked Man6GlcNAc2 or Man7GlcNAc2 in vivo were found to synthesize the same compounds but not the higher homologues in the cell-free assay. Species forming Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol in vivo were found to synthesize lipid-linked Man7GlcNAc2, Man8GlcNAc2, and Man9GlcNAc2 in vitro. It is concluded that there are at least three and probably four different dolichol-P-Man-dependent enzymatic activities involved in the synthesis of dolichol-P-P-linked Man9GlcNAc2 and that microorganisms not forming that compound are devoid of all mannosyltransferases responsible for the addition of the missing residues and not only of the enzyme involved in the synthesis of the homologue higher than the oligosaccharide occurring in vivo by a single mannose unit.</str>

Addition of cytochrome b5 purified from rat liver microsomes to the reconstituted system resulted in a remarkable increase in the hydroxylase activity. The level of P-450 HFLa in liver homogenates from human fetuses highly correlated with the activity of DHEA-sulfate 16 alpha-hydroxylase. Antibodies to P-450 HFLa inhibited the 16 alpha-hydroxylation of DHEA-sulfate in a dose-dependent manner. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of P-450 HFLa was similar to that of P-450NF (Beaune, P.

      <str>One of the major causes of failure in cancer chemotherapy is multidrug resistance (MDR), where cancer cells simultaneously become resistant to different anticancer drugs. Over-expression of membrane efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that recognizes different chemotherapeutic agents and transports them out of the cell, plays a major role in MDR. The shortcoming of P-gp inhibitors in clinic has been attributed to their non-specific action on P-gp and/or non-selective distribution to non-target organs that leads to intolerable side effects by the P-gp inhibitor at doses required for P-gp inhibition upon systemic administration. Another major issue is the reduced elimination of P-gp substrates (e.g. anticancer drugs) and intolerable toxicities by anticancer drugs when co-administered with P-gp inhibitors. To overcome these shortcomings, new generation of P-gp inhibitors with improved specificity for P-gp have been developed. More recently, attention has been paid to the use of drug delivery systems primarily to restrict P-gp inhibition to tumor and reduce the non-selective inhibition of P-gp in non-target organs. This review will provide an overview and update on the status of P-gp inhibition approaches and the role of drug delivery systems in overcoming P-gp mediated MDR.</str>

Age, weight, height, echocardiographic values, P-wave maximum duration and P-wave dispersion were compared between asthmatic and healthy children. P-wave duration was calculated in 12-leads of the surface electrocardiography. The difference between P maximum and P minimum durations was defined as P-wave dispersion. The obtained results were compared by independent samples t test and Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations for P-wave dispersion were calculated using Pearson test.</str>
      <str>P-wave maximum duration is slightly increased in patients with stable asthma (0.092 +/- 0.017 ms) as compared with healthy controls (0.083 +/- 0.011 ms) (p=0.07). We found significant correlation between P-wave dispersion and age (r=0.40, p=0.01), weight (r=0.41, p=0.008) and height (r=0.41, p=0.008).</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a cellular drug-efflux pump, is thought to be one of the major causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) in malignancies. Since therapeutic strategies are being developed to circumvent drug resistance by inhibiting P-gp function, large prospective studies evaluating the clinical relevance of P-gp in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are warranted. P-gp expression was evaluated over a period of 6 years in 102 consecutive patients with de novo childhood ALL and in 35 children with relapse of ALL. Bone marrow and blood smears were studied immunocytochemically with two monoclonal antibodies at initial diagnosis and at relapse. P-gp expression was found in 14 (14%) patients at initial diagnosis. After induction treatment, complete remission was achieved in 100/102 patients (98%), of whom 19 relapsed. Cumulative event-free survival was significantly higher in the P-gp-negative group compared with the P-gp-positive population (Logrank P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed the results to be independent of age, WBC count and karyotype, and concomitantly underlined the importance of MDR1 phenotype detection in childhood ALL. P-gp expression was more frequently found at relapse (34%) than at primary diagnosis (P = 0.01). In the relapsed patient group, P-gp-positive patients had a 2-fold greater risk for adverse clinical outcome than the P-gp-negative relapsed patients. P-gp expression was not induced by exposure to previous chemotherapy since the majority of P-gp-negative patients remained negative at relapse. P-glycoprotein expression in newly diagnosed childhood ALL is an independent adverse prognostic parameter with a predictive value for relapse.</str>

      <str>We determined the coding nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for a 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible cytochrome P-450, P-450d, of rat liver by sequence analysis of cloned cDNAs. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cytochrome is composed of 513 amino acids, and its NH2-terminal sequence of 30 amino acids completely coincides with that reported from analysis of the purified cytochrome P-450d. The amino acid composition of the deduced sequence also agrees well with that determined from the purified protein. Computer-aided analysis was carried out to compare the complete primary structures of five species of cytochrome P-450, two molecular species of phenobarbital-inducible rat liver cytochrome P-450 (P-450b and P-450e), phenobarbital-inducible rabbit liver cytochrome P-450LM2, 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible rat liver cytochrome P-450d, and camphor-hydroxylating P-450 of Pseudomonas putida (P-450CAM). It is concluded therefrom that the time of divergence between cytochrome P-450b (P-450e) and P-450d is much earlier than that of branching between phenobarbital-inducible cytochromes P-450 of rat and rabbit. One highly conserved cysteine-containing region that is close to the COOH terminus is found in all of these cytochrome P-450 sequences, indicating that the heme-binding site is the cysteine residue in this region.</str>

      <str>Earlier the autophosphorylation of myosin and the labile phosphate (P) content of rabbit skeletal muscle was reported [6, 7, 9]. The present paper describes that the endogeneous preformed P level in fresh preparation of exercised muscle is higher than that of untrained control one. It was revealed that the presence of a significant amount of mitochondrial myosin (with much higher P content) in the well-trained human muscle preparations falsified the appreciation of myofibrillar myosin. Therefore, a reliable myofibrillar preparation with correct P content from exercised subjects was obtained only after the separation of mitochondrial fraction. The P content of fresh preparations can be increased by phosphorylation even in the exercised muscle myosins up to the most higher level in human samples. The phosphoryl group incorporation from [gamma-32P]ATP into the rabbit and hare myosins was checked by radioactive tracer technique, and confirmed by total P content determination performed parallel with molybdate test. It was stated that under present circumstances the labelled 32P incorporation was lower even at an optimal substrate concentration than that of P value obtained directly with molybdate method; because the total P content of preparations had not exchanged during 2 min incubation. So it has been concluded from [gamma-23P] phosphoryl group assayments that much higher amount of P was incorporated into P-Arg, N pi-P-His and fraction 2 as compared with unappreciated labelled P level of the inorganic P (P-Ser, P-Thr), P-Lys, N tau-P-His and minor fractions. From these observations it has been considered that the P-Arg, N pi-P-His and fraction 2 take part in the contraction mechanism and in the course of physical training.</str>

      <str>Treatment of male Sprague-Dawley rats with 3,4,5,3',4',5'-hexabromobiphenyl (HBB) at 10 mumol/kg followed by purification of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450d revealed that HBB remained specifically bound to P-450d throughout purification. Binding was noncovalent since HBB was removed by extraction with dichloromethane. Although HBB induced both cytochrome P-450c and P-450d, specific immunoprecipitation of these isozymes from HBB-treated rats showed that HBB was associated only with cytochrome P-450d. Quantitation of HBB and cytochrome P-450d in microsomes from HBB-treated rats suggested a 0.9:1 ratio of HBB to cytochrome P-450d. Five other halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon inducers of cytochrome P-450d, bearing steric similarity to HBB (including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), were associated with cytochrome P-450d when used to induce cytochrome P-450d in rats. HBB inhibited estradiol 2-hydroxylase activity of purified cytochrome P-450d in a noncompetitive manner with an I50 of 38 nM for 50 nM P-450d whereas its noncoplanar isomer, 2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexabromobiphenyl, had an I50 over 700-fold higher. Thus certain polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, with the capacity to induce cytochrome P-450d also bind to the cytochrome when used as inducing agents and inhibit catalytic activity of the cytochrome.</str>

      <str>Postischemic administration of the sigma-1 agonists reduces ischemic brain injury; however, the mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that the sigma-1 agonist (+)isoform of pentazocine (P(+)) reduces damage in part by ameliorating cell death mediated via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and that the (-)isoform (P(-)) lacks this effect. We compared treatment with P(+) with or without the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG) and also the effects of P(+) in iNOS deficient (iNOSKO) mice. A possible mechanism of neuroprotection is inhibition of iNOS expression. Male C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (90 min) and drugs were administered with reperfusion: 1) P(+) with AG (P+/AG), 2) P(+), 3) P(-), 4) AG, or 5) placebo. iNOSKOs were treated with either P(+) or placebo. Infarction (triphenyltetrazolium chloride histology, 72 h) was reduced by P(+) treatment in striatum by 44% and in neocortex by 23% versus placebo (P &lt; 0.05), a reduction comparable to AG effect. P(-) did not attenuate brain injury. There was no difference in P(+)/AG treatment compared with showed the same level of neuroprotection as P(+) alone. P(+) also did not provide further neuroprotection for iNOSKOs. We conclude that postischemic administration of P(+) reduces infarct volume in mice. Because AG provides no additional benefit to P(+) treatment and iNOSKOs do not benefit from P(+), we speculate that P(+) acts by suppressing cell death resulting from iNOS toxicity.</str>

We conducted a case-control study using clinical data collected on 8,097 female patients (1,225 breast cancer cases and 6,872 controls) seen in the Mayo Clinic Breast Clinic between August 1, 1993 and November 31, 2003. Breast cancer patients and noncancer patients significantly differed with respect to age at time of the index visit (p &lt; 0.001), number of pregnancies (p = 0.006), number of live births (p = 0.002), vital status at last known follow-up (p &lt; 0.001), current menstruation (p &lt; 0.001), age at menopause (p &lt; 0.001), history of hysterectomy (p &lt; 0.001), use of oral contraception (p = 0.05), duration of oral contraception use (p = 0.001), use of other exogenous hormones (p &lt; 0.001), duration of exogenous hormone use (p = 0.05), breast pain at time of index visit (p = 0.002), smoking status (p &lt; 0.001), and use of five or more alcoholic beverages per week (p = 0.002). After adjustment for these baseline characteristics, having a personal history of smoking was found to be predictive of breast cancer diagnosis (odds ratios [OR] = 1.25, p = 0.004). Other positive predictors for breast cancer diagnosis were: age (OR = 1.02, p &lt; 0.001), history of hysterectomy (OR = 0.66, p &lt; 0.001), prior use of oral contraception for more than 11 years (OR = 2.10, p &lt; 0.001), and prior use of other exogenous hormones/estrogen (OR = 1.81, p &lt; 0.001). In this referral practice having a personal history of smoking is predictive of breast cancer diagnosis. Further studies are needed to further explore this relationship.</str>

      <str>The serum concentration of inflammation-associated proteins and several complement components in the cord blood of 215 newborns with and without chorioamnionitis (CAM), who were delivered between 17 and 42 weeks of gestation, were measured. We investigated the relationship of levels of serum proteins to acute, subacute, and chronic CAM, and to subacute necrotizing funisitis (SNF). Complement components C3d, C3, and C4 levels increased in subacute CAM (P = 0. 0002, P = 0.0007, P = 0.0029, respectively), whereas factor B increased in each type of CAM (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, P = 0.0004, respectively). Among the immunoglobulins, IgG levels were unrelated to the presence or type of CAM, IgM levels increased in subacute CAM (P &lt; 0.0001), and IgA levels increased in chronic CAM (P &lt; 0.0001). Among the acute phase reactants (APR), haptoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased in acute (P &lt; 0.0001, P = 0.0022, respectively) and chronic CAM (P = 0.0035, P = 0.0345, respectively), whereas orosomucoid levels increased in chronic CAM (P = 0.0003). IL-6 levels increased in acute (P = 0.0011) and subacute (P = 0. 0475) CAM. C3d (P = 0.0063), C3 (P = 0.0289), C4 (P = 0.0491), and IgM (P &lt; 0.0001) levels were increased in SNF. These findings suggest that the histologic distinction of acute, subacute, and chronic CAM is a useful indicator of the inflammatory mediator status of the infants. The infants with SNF may have ended their initial active inflammatory states, but they still have subacute immune activation.</str>

      <str>The multiphosphorylated tryptic peptide alpha(s1)-casein(59-79) has been shown to be antigenic with anti-casein antibodies. In an approach to determine the amino acyl residues critical for antibody binding we undertook an epitope analysis of the peptide using overlapping synthetic peptides. With alpha(s1)-casein(59-79) as the adsorbed antigen in a competitive ELISA only two of five overlapping synthetic peptides at 1 mM significantly inhibited binding of the anti-casein antibodies. Peptides Glu-Ser(P)-Ile-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Glu-Glu and Ile-Val-Pro-Asn-Ser(P)-Val-Glu-Glu inhibited antibody binding by 20.0+/-3.6% and 60.3+/-7.9%, respectively. The epitope of Glu63-Ser(P)-Ile-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Glu-Glu70 was further localised to the phosphoseryl cluster as the peptide Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P) significantly inhibited binding of the anti-casein antibodies to alpha(s1)-casein(59-79) by 29.5+/-7.4%. Substitution of Ser(P)75 with Ser75 in the second inhibitory peptide Ile-Val-Pro-Asn-Ser(P)75-Val-Glu-Glu also abolished inhibition of antibody binding to x(s1)-casein (59-79) demonstrating that Ser(P)75 is also a critical residue for recognition by the antibodies. These data show that the phosphorylated residues in the cluster sequence -Ser(P)66-Ser(P)-Ser(P)68 and in the sequence -Pro73-Asn-Ser(P)-Val-Glu77- are critical for antibody binding to x(s1)-casein(59-79) and further demonstrate that a highly phosphorylated segment of a protein can be antigenic.</str>

      <str>Managing phosphorus (P) losses in soil leachate folllowing land application of manure is key to curbing eutrophication in many regions. We compared P leaching from columns of variably textured, intact soils (20 cm diam., 20 cm high) subjected to surface application or injection of dairy cattle (Bos taurus L.) manure slurry. Surface application of slurry increased P leaching losses relative to baseline losses, but losses declined with increasing active flow volume. After elution of one pore volume, leaching averaged 0.54 kg P ha(-1) from the loam, 0.38 kg P ha(-1) from the sandy loam, and 0.22 kg P ha(-1) from the loamy sand following surface application. Injection decreased leaching of all P forms compared with surface application by an average of 0.26 kg P ha(-1) in loam and 0.23 kg P ha(-1) in sandy loam, but only by 0.03 kg P ha(-1) in loamy sand. Lower leaching losses were attributed to physical retention of particulate P and dissolved organic P, caused by placing slurry away from active flow paths in the fine-textured soil columns, as well as to chemical retention of dissolved inorganic P, caused by better contact between slurry P and soil adsorption sites. Dissolved organic P was less retained in soil after slurry application than other P forms. On these soils with low to intermediate P status, slurry injection lowered P leaching losses from clay-rich soil, but not from the sandy soils, highlighting the importance of soil texture in manageing P losses following slurry application.</str>

      <str>In a neutrophil-dependent model of acute postischemic renal failure (APRF), eliminating or blocking P-selectin reduces postischemic neutrophil infiltration and preserves kidney function. This study was designed to identify the role of platelet vs. endothelial P-selectin in APRF. Using wild-type (wt) and P-selectin-deficient (P-/-) mice, we generated chimeric mice by bone marrow transplantation. Chimeric mice exclusively expressed either platelet (Plt-P) or endothelial P-selectin (EC-P). APRF was induced by bilateral renal ischemia in situ (32 min), followed by reperfusion; 48 h after reperfusion, EC-P had significantly lower creatinine concentrations (twofold over sham) than Plt-P (eightfold over sham). Compared with wt, protection from renal failure in EC-P was similar to that observed in P-/-. Plt-P and EC-P demonstrated similar overall postischemic neutrophil infiltration as measured by renal myeloperoxidase activity. However, Plt-P showed massive neutrophil infiltration into outer and inner medulla, similar to that in wt. EC-P had only patchy, more diffuse neutrophil influx. Our study identifies platelet P-selectin as crucial for postischemic neutrophil recruitment into outer and inner medulla, which is detrimental to the development of APRF. This suggests that novel therapeutic strategies for postischemic organ failure could be aimed at neutrophil-platelet interactions.</str>

      <str>The mechanism(s) behind the larger relative increase of Plasma beta 2 microglobulin (P-beta 2m) than that of Plasma albumin (P-alb) during Cuprophan hemodialysis is disputed. To elucidate this phenomenon P-alb, P-beta 2m (MW 11,800) and Plasma cystatin (P-cC; MW 13,000) an inhibitor of cystein proteinases, were determined before and after a Cuprophan or polysulphone hemodialysis (4-7 hr, QB 200 ml/min) in 30 stable regular dialysis treatment (RDT) patients. Body weight (BW) decreased by 2.5 +/- 1.4% (mean +/- SD). P-alb, P-beta 2m and P-cC increased by 11.4 +/- 14.8%, 15.4 +/- 11.5%, and 22.1 +/- 14.3%, respectively, during Cuprophan dialysis. The relative increase of P-cC was larger than that of P-beta 2m (P less than 0.05) and that of P-alb (P less than 0.02). During polysulphone dialysis BW decreased by 4.1 +/- 1.8%. P-alb, P-beta 2m, and P-cC increased almost equally by 28.1 +/- 18, 26.5 +/- 19.2, and 26.8 +/- 14.4%, respectively. These results are hard to interpret. Is the increase in P-cC a new marker of biocompatibility or does it reflect the true shift of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins between the interstitial and the plasma volume during hemodialysis better than P-beta 2m? In vitro studies indicate that small amounts of both Serum beta 2m (S-beta 2m) and Serum cystatin C (S-cC) are adsorbed to or sieved through the Cuprophan membrane, findings which render the kinetics of LMW proteins during hemodialysis still more complex.</str>

      <str>The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of action of substance P at the distal ileum, ileocecal sphincter (ICS), and proximal colon in the cat and to determine the localization of substance P receptors at these sites by autoradiography. Intraluminal pressures and myoelectric activity were recorded at the feline distal ileum, ICS, and colon. Substance P caused a tonic and phasic spike-dependent contractile response at all three sites. The antagonists propranolol, phentolamine, and naloxone did not affect the contractile response to substance P at the ileum, ICS, or colon. The ganglionic blocker trimethaphan camsylate potentiated the response to substance P at all three sites, P less than 0.05. Both atropine and tetrodotoxin reduced the response of substance P at the ileal site. At the ICS, atropine or tetrodotoxin reduced, but did not obliterate, the effect of substance P. Neither atropine nor tetrodotoxin reduced substance P-induced colonic contractions. By use of autoradiography, specific binding for substance P was determined to be present at all three sites with the greatest concentration of substance P receptors in the circular muscle layer. In conclusion, these studies suggest multiple sites of action of substance P. At the ileum, substance P causes contraction via a cholinergic pathway. At the ICS, substance P has an excitatory action through a cholinergic pathway and also at smooth muscle receptors. In the proximal colon, the excitatory action of substance P is via smooth muscle receptors. An inhibitory ganglionic pathway also exists at all three sites.

      <str>Obesity has been associated with compromised tissue oxygenation and reduced organ perfusion. The brain is critically dependent on oxygen delivery, and reduced brain tissue oxygen tension (P(bt)O(2)) may result in poor outcome after brain injury. We tested the hypothesis that obesity is associated with compromised P(bt)O(2) after severe brain injury.</str>
      <str>Patients with severe brain injury (GCS score ≤ 8) who underwent continuous P(bt)O(2) monitoring were retrospectively identified from a prospective single-center database. Patients, were classified by body mass index (BMI = weight (kg)/m(2)) and were included if they were obese (BMI ≥ 30) or non-obese (BMI = &lt; 30).</str>
      <str>Sixty-nine patients (mean age 46.4 ± 17.0 years) were included. Mean daily P(bt)O(2) was 25.8 (9.6) mmHg for the 28 obese and 31.8 (12.3) mmHg for the 41 non-obese patients (P = 0.03). Initial P(bt)O(2) and mean daily maximum P(bt)O(2) measurements also were significantly lower in obese patients than in non-obese patients. Univariate predictors of compromised P(bt)O(2) (defined as minutes P(bt)O(2) &lt; 20 mmHg) included elevated BMI (P = 0.02), presence of ARDS (P &lt; 0.01), mean PaO(2) (P &lt; 0.01), maximum FiO(2) (P &lt; 0.01), mean PaO(2):FiO(2) (P &lt; 0.01), and mean CVP (P &lt; 0.01). In multivariable analysis, BMI was significantly associated with compromised P(bt)O(2) (P = 0.02). Sex, age, and mean CVP were also identified as significant predictors of compromised P(bt)O(2); ARDS and PF ratio were not.</str>

      <str>Traditional corn (Zea mays L.) (TC), the primary grain used in swine (Sus scrofa) diets, stores a majority of its P as phytate, which is largely unavailable for digestion by nonruminant animals. Low-phytate corn (LPC) contains similar amounts of total P but a smaller percentage of P as phytate. When fed to swine, LPC increases P utilization and reduces P content of manure. While differences in P content between manure from animals fed TC and LPC diets have been documented, solubility and lability of manure P have not been compared. Manure P was characterized in manure from swine fed either LPC or TC diets in 2000 and 2001. Total P was lower (20 vs. 34 g kg(-1)) and N to P ratio was higher (4.5 vs. 3.3) in LPC manure than in TC manure. Manures were sequentially extracted with deionized water, 0.5 M NaHCO3, 0.1 M NaOH, and 1.0 M HCl. Extracts were analyzed for inorganic and total P. Most P (approximately 80%) in the extracts was in the inorganic form. Concentration of P in the water-extractable fraction was lower for LPC manure (10.2 g kg(-1) in 2000 and 9.7 g kg(-1) in 2001) than for TC manure (13.6 g kg(-1) in 2000 and 17.0 g kg(-1) in 2001). Percentage of total P in each extract was in the order of: H2O (60%), HCl (22%), NaHCO3 (12%), NaOH (8%), and residue (&lt;1%). Total P and distribution of P in extracts indicates swine are able to utilize more P contained in LPC feed but the composition of P excreted in LPC manure is similar to TC manure. Solubility, crop availability, and lability of P in LPC manure should be similar to that of TC manure.</str>

      <str>The character of arthritis has not received the same attention in Pan paniscus as it has in P. troglodytes. Reactive arthritis (a form of spondyloarthropathy) in the latter has been considered to be either a sexually transmitted or an infectious-agent diarrhea-related disorder. The unique sexual promiscuity of P. paniscus enables us to distinguish between those hypotheses. The macerated skeletons of 139 adult P. paniscus, P. troglodytes troglodytes, and P. troglodytes schweinfurthii were macroscopically analyzed for osseous and articular pathologies. The sex of the animal was recorded at the time of acquisition. Twenty-one percent of the P. paniscus, 28% of the P. t. troglodytes, and 27% of the P. t. schweinfurthii specimens had peripheral and central joint erosive disease characteristic of spondyloarthropathy. Subchondral pauciarticular distribution and reactive new bone clearly distinguish this disease from rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and direct bone/joint infection. The fact that P. paniscus and P. t. troglodytes were similar in terms of disease frequency makes the notion of sexual transmission unlikely. While the frequencies of spondyloarthropathy were indistinguishable among all species/subspecies studied, the patterns of joint involvement were disparate. The Pan paniscus and P. t. troglodytes home ranges are geographically separate. We assessed possible habitat factors (e.g., exposure to specific infectious agents of diarrhea) by comparing P. paniscus and P. t. troglodytes with P. t. schweinfurthii. The latter shared similar patterns and habitats (separated by the Congo River) with P. paniscus. The explanation offered for habitat-specific patterns is differential bacterial exposure-most likely Shigella or Yersinia in P. paniscus and P. t. schweinfurthii.</str>

      <str>Between May 1988 and June 2000, 698 children were treated in the Medical Research Council acute myeloid leukemia 10 and 12 trials. The presenting features and outcomes of therapy in these children were compared by age. Although there was no single cutoff in age, younger children were more likely to have intermediate risk and less likely to have favorable cytogenetics (P &lt;.001), and they had a higher incidence of translocations involving chromosome 11q23 (P &lt;.001). The distribution of French-American-British (FAB) types also varied with age; FAB types M5 (P &lt;.001) and M7 (P &lt;.001) were more common in early childhood, whereas older children were more likely to have FAB types M0 (P =.03), M1 (P =.04), M2 (P =.005), and M3 (P &lt;.001). Involvement of the central nervous system at diagnosis was also more common in the youngest children (P =.01). Younger children had more severe diarrhea (P =.002), whereas older children had worse nausea and vomiting (P =.01) after chemotherapy. When adjusted for other important factors, complete remission rates were similar (P =.5) and although there was less resistant disease in younger children (P =.003), this was partially balanced by a slight increase in deaths during induction therapy in younger patients (P =.06). On multivariate analysis overall survival (P =.02), event-free survival (P =.02), and disease-free survival were better (P =.06) in younger children due to a lower relapse rate (P =.02) especially in the bone marrow (P =.02).</str>

      <str>We have found a novel metabolic pathway of arylethers, involving the cleavage of the oxygen-aromatic ring bond. When p-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenol was utilized as a substrate, cleaved products, p-nitrophenol and p-benzoquinone, were formed in two cytochrome P450 model systems, meso-tetraphenylporphinatoiron(III) chloride-NaBH4/O2 system and meso-tetrakis (2,6-difluorophenyl)porphinatoiron(III) chloride-m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) system. Rat liver microsomes also catalyzed this reaction, which was inhibited by a cytochrome P450-specific inhibitor, and it was confirmed that this cleavage proceeded in vivo. Further, experiments using [18O]mCPBA and 18O2 proved that the cleavage reaction is accompanied with the ipso-substitution by the oxygen atom of the active species in both cytochrome P450 model system and cytochrome P450. When the microsomal reactions of p-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenol analogues which lack a hydroxy group, namely p-nitrophenoxybenzene, p-(p-nitrophenoxy)anisole, and p-(p-nitrophenoxy)toluene, were investigated, the cleavage reaction occurred via p-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenol in the cases of p-nitrophenoxybenzene and p-(p-nitrophenoxy)anisole, indicating that a hydroxy group at the p-position to the ether bond is necessary for this pathway. This metabolic pathway appears to be important, because a diarylether linkage, which is very stable and has generally been thought to resist metabolism, is cleaved and benzoquinone, a highly toxic metabolite, is formed.</str>

      <str>Isolates previously thought to be Prevotella intermedia have been shown to be a closely related species now known as Prevotella nigrescens. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to differentiate endodontic isolates of P. nigrescens from P. intermedia. Fifty-six strains of black-pigmented bacteria isolated from endodontic infections and conventionally identified as P. intermedia were used in this study. Using SDS-PAGE, novel polypeptide bands were used to differentiate P. nigrescens from P. intermedia. PCR was accomplished with specific primers for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of both strains. Of 56 endodontic isolates, 41 (73%) strains were identified by SDS-PAGE as P. nigrescens and 15 (27%) strains as P. intermedia. Of the 41 strains of P. nigrescens identified by SDS-PAGE, PCR identified 37 strains as P. nigrescens. Restriction endonuclease digestion of amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes indicated that the remaining four strains originally identified by SDS-PAGE as P. nigrescens were actually strains of Prevotella distinct from P. nigrescens and P. intermedia. Of 15 strains of P. intermedia identified by SDS-PAGE, PCR identified 14 strains as P. intermedia; but, one strain was identified as P. nigrescens. The results indicated that PCR was a more precise method than SDS-PAGE to differentiate P. intermedia from P. nigrescens. This study confirms that P. nigrescens is more commonly isolated in pure culture from endodontic infections than P. intermedia.</str>

Of these compounds, only salicylate and p-nitrobenzoic acid were not activated to their respective CoA esters. Salicylate, p-chloro- and p-nitrobenzoic acids effectively prevented inhibition of glucose synthesis and alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate oxidation by valproic acid, p-octyl-, and p-aminobenzoic acids, p-Octyl- and p-aminobenzoic acids greatly depleted hepatocyte free CoA and acetyl-CoA contents and increased the content of acid-insoluble and acid-soluble CoA esters respectively. p-Chloro- and p-nitrobenzoic acids prevented the sequestration of CoA as p-octylbenzoyl-CoA or p-aminobenzoyl-CoA in hepatocytes incubated with these compounds. p-Chlorobenzoic acid not only prevented but also reversed the inhibition of gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes incubated with p-octylbenzoic acid. These results suggest that p-chloro- or p-nitrobenzoic acids might be effectively used to reverse some of the hepatotoxic effects of the CoA esters of valproic acid or naturally-occurring organic acids, such as those which accumulate in Reye's Syndrome or organic acidemias.</str>

      <str>HPr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). In gram-positive bacteria, HPr can be phosphorylated on Ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase HprK/P and on His-15 by phospho-enzyme I (EI~P) of the PTS. In vitro studies with purified HPrs from Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. However, a recent study showed that while the rate of Streptococcus salivarius HPr phosphorylation by EI~P is reduced at acidic pH, the phosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) by EI~P, generating HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), is stimulated. This suggests that HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality. Consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) have been detected in some streptococci. The present study was aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular pH. Our results indicated that unlike Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis, and E. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) during growth. We also showed that Streptococcus salivarius IIABLMan, a protein involved in sugar transport by the PTS, could be efficiently phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).</str>

      <str>Phosphorus (P) loss in tile drainage water may vary with agricultural practices, and the impacts are often hard to detect with short-term studies. We evaluated the effects of long-term (≥43 yr) cropping systems (continuous corn [CC], corn-oats-alfalfa-alfalfa rotation [CR], and continuous grass [CS]) and fertilization (fertilization [F] vs. no-fertilization [NF]) on P loss in tile drainage water from a clay loam soil over a 4-yr period. Compared with NF, long-term fertilization increased concentrations and losses of dissolved reactive P (DRP), dissolved unreactive P (DURP), and total P (TP) in tile drainage water, with the increments following the order: CS &gt; CR &gt; CC. Dissolved P (dissolved reactive P [DRP] and dissolved unreactive P [DURP]) was the dominant P form in drainage outflow, accounting for 72% of TP loss under F-CS, whereas particulate P (PP) was the major form of TP loss under F-CC (72%), F-CR (62%), NF-CS (66%), NF-CC (74%), and NF-CR (72%). Dissolved unreactive P played nearly equal roles as DRP in P losses in tile drainage water. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the concentration of P (DRP, DURP, and PP) in tile drainage flow, rather than event flow volume, was the most important factor contributing to P loss in tile drainage water, although event flow volume was more important in PP loss than in dissolved P loss. Continuous grass significantly increased P loss by increasing P concentration and flow volume of tile drainage water, especially under the fertilization treatment. Long-term grasslands may become a significant P source in tile-drained systems when they receive regular P addition. </str>

      <str>Leaching of phosphorus (P) mobilizes edaphic and applied sources of P and is a primary pathway of concern in agricultural soils of the Delmarva Peninsula, which defines the eastern boundary of the eutrophic Chesapeake Bay. We evaluated P leaching before and after poultry litter application from intact soil columns (30 cm diameter × 50 cm depth) obtained from low- and high-P members of four dominant Delmarva Peninsula soils. Surface soil textures ranged from fine sand to silt loam, and Mehlich-3 soil P ranged from 64 to 628 mg kg. Irrigation of soil columns before litter application pointed to surface soil P controls on dissolved P in leachate (with soil P sorption saturation providing a stronger relationship than Mehlich-3 P); however, strong relationships between P in the subsoil (45-50 cm) and leachate P concentrations were also observed ( = 0.61-0.73). After poultry litter application (4.5 Mg ha), leachate P concentrations and loads increased significantly for the finest-textured soils, consistent with observations that well-structured soils have the greatest propensity to transmit applied P. Phosphorus derived from poultry litter appeared to contribute 41 and 76% of total P loss in leachate from the two soils with the finest textures. Results point to soil P, including P sorption saturation, as a sound metric of P loss potential in leachate when manure is not an acute source of P but highlight the need to factor in macropore transport potential to predict leaching losses from applied P sources. </str>

High positive staining for P-gp was observed in 72.8% of pancreatic tumors and in 73.2% of ductal adenocarcinoma. In ductal adenocarcinoma, immunoreactivity of P-gp was inversely correlated with biological aggressiveness of tumors determined by histologic grading (P&lt;0.01), tumor size (P &lt; 0.01), retroperitoneal invasion (P &lt; 0.01) and portal invasion (P &lt; 0.05).

The levels of MDR1 mRNA showed a moderate correlation with those of P-gp (r=0.62, P&lt;0.0001). Higher expression levels of MDR1/P-gp significantly correlated with better prognosis of patients with ductal carcinoma (P &lt; 0.05). Among patients with ductal carcinoma, the high staining group for P-gp revealed a 3.5-fold better prognosis compared with the low staining group (HR=3.47, 95% CI=1.62, 7.45; P=0.0016).

      <str>The effects of moderate dietary P restriction on intestinal net fluxes and external balances of P and Ca were studied in growing female albino rabbits that were fed a P-deficient diet for 10 consecutive days while they were housed in metabolism cages. Intestinal P secretion occurred during the first 24 h of P restriction and thereafter changed to absorption. During recovery, when the rabbits were consuming a normal diet, P absorption was significantly greater than either prerestriction control values or than in a separate group of time control rabbits. Phosphorus balance was negative during the 1st day of P restriction but thereafter became positive. This pattern occurred because intestinal P secretion changed to absorption and because urinary losses of P were negligible. Intestinal Ca absorption increased within 24 h of P restriction, reached maximal values by 4 days, and remained elevated for each of the remaining 6 days that dietary P was low. It also was elevated compared to P-sufficient time controls for 8 days after replenishment of dietary P. Despite increased intestinal absorption, Ca balance was significantly reduced during P restriction because of substantial hypercalciuria. Thus, selective dietary P restriction reduced the positive balances of both P and Ca that are characteristic of growth. We conclude that in growing rabbits moderate dietary P restriction induces both intestinal and renal adaptations that conserve this mineral; concomitantly, positive Ca balance is reduced. With dietary P replenishment, adaptations persist to restore the positive mineral balances that were lost because of dietary P restriction during growth.</str>

      <str>Land application of drinking-water treatment residuals (WTR) has been shown to control excess soil soluble P and can reduce off-site P losses to surface and ground water. To our knowledge, no field study has directly evaluated the impacts of land application of WTRs on ground water quality. We monitored the effects of three organic sources of P (poultry manure, Boca Raton biosolids, Pompano biosolids) or triple superphosphate co-applied with an aluminum-based WTR (Al-WTR) on soil and ground water P and Al concentrations under natural field conditions for 20 mo in a soil with limited P sorption capacity. The P sources were applied at two rates (based on P or nitrogen [N] requirement of bahiagrass) with or without Al-WTR amendment and replicated three times. Without WTR application, applied P sources increased surface soil soluble P concentrations regardless of the P source or application rate. Co-applying the P sources with Al-WTR prevented increases in surface soil soluble P concentrations and reduced P losses to shallow ground water. Total dissolved P and orthophosphate concentrations of shallow well ground water of the N-based treatments were greater (&gt;0.9 and 0.3 mg L(-1), respectively) in the absence than in the presence ( approximately 0.6 and 0.2 mg L(-1), respectively) of Al-WTR. The P-based application rate did not increase ground water P concentrations relative to background concentrations. Notwithstanding, Al-WTR amendment decreased ground water P concentrations from soil receiving treatments with P-based application rates. Ground water total dissolved Al concentrations were unaffected by soil Al-WTR application. We conclude that, at least for the study period, Al-WTR can be safely used to reduce P leaching into ground water without increasing the Al concentration of ground water.</str>

      <str>Measurement of the arterial carbon dioxide (P(a)CO(2)) is an established part of the monitoring of mechanically ventilated patients. Other ways to get information about carbon dioxide in the patient are measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide (P(ET)CO(2)) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PTCCO2). Carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebral tissue has great influence on vasoactivity and thereby blood volume of the brain. We have found no studies on the correlation between P(ET)CO(2) or P(TC)CO(2), and P(a)CO(2) during hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).</str>
      <str>We studied 10 intubated and ventilatory stable patients during HBOT. End-tidal and transcutaneous measurements provided continuous data. Arterial blood samples were collected after reaching the operational pressure of 284 kPa (2.8 ATA) and analysed outside the chamber. A total of 17 paired samples of P(ET)CO(2), P(TC)CO(2) and P(a)CO(2) were obtained.</str>
      <str>There was a good correlation between P(ET)CO(2) and P(a)CO(2) using linear regression (r(2) = 0.83). Bland-Altman analysis showed that P(ET)CO(2) on average was 2.22 kPa higher than P(a)CO(2) with limits of agreement (LoA) at ± 2.4 kPa. P(TC)CO(2), on average, was 2.16 kPa lower than P(a)CO(2) and the correlation using linear regression was poor (r(2) = 0.24). Bland-Altman analysis revealed LoA at ± 3.2 kPa.</str>
      <str>During hyperbaric conditions we found that P(ET)CO(2) as opposed to P(TC)CO(2) offered the greater precision, but there was great variability among patients. Care must be taken when using P(ET)CO(2) or P(TC)CO(2) as an estimate of P(a)CO(2).</str>

      <str>Previous studies suggest that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) modulates the PK/PD of many compounds including opioid agonists and chemotherapeutic agents. The objective of this study was to assess the P-gp affinity status of oxycodone, the P-gp expression, and the paclitaxel's tissue distribution in oxycodone-treated rats. P-gp ATPase assay, Caco-2 transepithelial permeability studies, and mdr1a/b (-/-) mice were used to assess the P-gp affinity status of oxycodone. P-gp expression was determined by Western blot analysis while [(14)C] paclitaxel's distributions in the liver, kidney, brain, and plasma tissues were determined by liquid scintillation counter. Oxycodone stimulated the P-gp ATPase activity in a concentration-dependant manner. The Caco-2 secretory transport of oxycodone was reduced from 3.64 x 10(-5) to 1.96 x 10(-5) cm/s (p &lt; 0.05) upon preincubation with the P-gp inhibitor, verapamil. The brain levels of oxycodone in mdr1a/b (+/+) were not detectable (&lt;15 ng/mL) while in mdr1a/b (-/-) the average levels were 115 +/- 39 ng/mL. The P-gp protein levels were increased by 1.3-4.0 folds while paclitaxel's tissue distributions were decreased by 38-90% (p &lt; 0.05) in oxycodone-treated rats. These findings display that oxycodone is a P-gp substrate, induces overexpression of P-gp, and affects paclitaxel's tissue distribution in a manner that may influence its chemotherapeutic activity.</str>

      <str>In this study, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux of simvastatin (SV), simvastatin acid (SVA), and atorvastatin (AVA) and inhibition of P-gp by SV, SVA, and AVA were evaluated to assess the role of P-gp in drug interactions.</str>
      <str>P-gp mediated efflux of SV, SVA, and AVA was determined by directional transport across monolayers of LLC-PK1 cells and LLC-PK1 cells transfected with human MDR1. Inhibition of P-gp was evaluated by studying the vinblastine efflux in Caco-2 cells and in P-gp overexpressing KBV1 cells at concentrations of SV, SVA, and AVA up to 50 microM.</str>
      <str>Directional transport studies showed insignificant P-gp mediated efflux of SV, and moderate P-gp transport [2.4-3.8 and 3.0-6.4 higher Basolateral (B) to Apical (A) than A to B transport] for SVA and AVA, respectively. Inhibition studies did not show the same trend as the transport studies with SV and AVA inhibiting P-gp (IC50 -25-50 microM) but SVA not showing any inhibition of P-gp.</str>
      <str>The moderate level of P-gp mediated transport and low affinity of SV, SVA, and AVA for P-gp inhibition compared to systemic drug levels suggest that drug interactions due to competition for P-gp transport is unlikely to be a significant factor in adverse drug interactions. Moreover, the inconsistencies between P-gp inhibition studies and P-gp transport of SV, SVA, and AVA indicate that the inhibition studies are not a valid means to identify statins as Pgp substrates.</str>

      <str>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) using p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HB), p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPA) and p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (p-HPPA) as templates were synthesized. The performance of the templates and their analogues on polymer-based high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns was studied. The imprinting effect of the MIP using p-HB as template is more obvious than that of MIP using either p-HPA or p-HPPA as template, and the mixture of p-HB and p-HPA can be well separated on the MIP using p-HB as template, but not on the blank. Interestingly, the recognition of MIP (p-HB as the template) to p-HB showed a synergistic effect. The retention factor of p-HB is not the sum of those of phenol and benzoic acid. We also found that the imprinting effect decreased when increasing the concentration of acetic acid in mobile phase. The possible reason is that acetic acid molecules occupied the binding sites of the polymer, thereby decreasing the concentration of binding sites. Furthermore, polymers, which showed specificity to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, can be prepared with p-HB as template. It is thus possible to synthesize a specific polymer for a compound that is either expensive or unstable by using a structurally similar compound as template.</str>

      <str>An experiment was conducted to estimate true ileal phosphorus ( P: ) digestibility of 3 meat and bone meal samples ( MBM-1, MBM-2: , and MBM-3: ) for broiler chickens. Four semipurified diets were formulated from each sample to contain graded concentrations of P. The experiment was conducted as a completely randomized design with 6 replicates (6 birds per replicate) per dietary treatment. A total of 432 Ross 308 broilers were assigned at 21 d of age to the 12 test diets. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of P was determined by the indicator method, and the linear regression method was used to determine the true P digestibility coefficient. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of P in birds fed diets containing MBM-1 and MBM-2 was unaffected by increasing dietary concentrations of P (P &gt; 0.05). The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of P in birds fed the MBM-3 diets decreased with increasing P concentrations (linear, P &lt; 0.001; quadratic, P &lt; 0. 01). In birds fed the MBM-1 and MBM-2 diets, ileal endogenous P losses were estimated to be 0.049 and 0.142 g/kg DM intake ( DMI: ), respectively. In birds fed the MBM-3 diets, endogenous P loss was estimated to be negative (-0.370 g/kg DMI). True ileal P digestibility of MBM-1, MBM-2, and MBM-3 was determined to be 0.693, 0.608, and 0.420, respectively. True ileal P digestibility coefficients determined for MBM-1 and MBM-2 were similar (P &lt; 0.05), but were higher (P &lt; 0.05) than that for MBM-3. Total P and true digestible P contents of MBM-1, MBM-2, and MBM-3 were determined to be 37.5 and 26.0; 60.2 and 36.6; and 59.8 and 25.1 g/kg, respectively, on an as-fed basis. </str>

      <str>The conversion of mobile phosphorus (P) to aluminum bound P (Al-P) after addition of Al to over 300 sub-samples from 35 sediment cores collected from 20 lakes in the upper Midwest, United States was investigated in this study. Consistent relationships between mobile P reduction and Al-P formation were detected across a broad range of mobile sediment P contents (0.04-2.8 g P m(-2) cm(-1) or 0.083-2.8 mg P g(-1)DW) and lake types. The conversion of mobile P to Al-P was dependent on the initial mobile sediment P content and the amount of Al added to the sediment. An empirical model was then developed to predict the formation of Al-P based on the amount of Al added relative to the initial mass of mobile P in the sediment. The results were compared to sediment collected from an Al treated lake and good agreement was found between the model and in-situ changes to sediment P fractions caused by Al treatment. The model developed in this study, unlike previous models with extreme, singular endpoints, allows for a continuum of estimates for mobile P conversion to Al-P, along with efficiency of P binding by Al, as Al dose varies. Model results can be used in conjunction with mobile sediment P based predictions for internal P loading to calculate an Al dose required to meet internal phosphorus loading goals for lake management and restoration without the need for expensive, time consuming Al additions to sediment.</str>

      <str>Repeated manure application can lead to excessive soil test P (STP) levels and increased P concentration in runoff, but also to improved water infiltration and reduced runoff. Research was conducted to evaluate soil P tests in prediction of P concentration in runoff and to determine the residual effects of composted manure on runoff P loss and leaching of P. The research was conducted from 2001 to 2004 under natural runoff events with plots of 11-m length. Low-P and high-P compost had been applied during the previous 3 yr, resulting in total applications of 750 and 1150 kg P ha(-1). Bray-P1 in the surface 5 cm of soil was increased from 16 to 780 mg kg(-1) with application of high-P compost. Runoff and sediment losses were 69 and 120% greater with no compost than with residual compost treatments. Runoff P concentration increased as STP increased, but much P loss occurred with the no-compost treatment as well. Agronomic soil tests were predictive of mean runoff P concentration, but increases in STP resulted in relatively small increases in runoff P concentration. Downward movement of P was not detected below 0.3 m. In conclusion, agronomic soil tests are useful in predicting long-term runoff P concentration, and risk of P loss may be of concern even at moderate soil P levels. The residual effect of compost application in reducing sediment and runoff loss was evident more than 3 yr after application and should be considered in P indices.</str>

Although treatment with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene or PCB markedly increased the total amount of hepatic cytochrome P-450, P-450-male and P-450-female were rather decreased or not significantly changed. Thus, the percentages of P-450-male and P-450-female in the total cytochrome P-450 were decreased in liver microsomes from the treated rats. The increases in specific cytochrome P-450, such as P-448-H, P-448-L, and P-450I-c accounted for the increase in the total amount of cytochrome P-450 in the treated rats. The treatment with phenobarbital or PCB increased the activities of testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase, benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and aminopyrine N-demethylase more markedly in female rats than in male rats. Similarly, the treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene increased benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase more markedly in female rats. Therefore, the sex-differences in testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase, benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, and aminopyrine N-demethylase activities became smaller after the drug treatment. These results indicate that sex-specific P-450-male and P-450-female were unaffected, or even depressed by the agents in some cases.</str>

      <str>Recent reports suggest that expression of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme may up-regulate expression of MDR1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/P-gp), an exponent of resistance to cytostatic drugs. The present study aimed at examining the relationship between the expression of COX-2 and of MDR1/P-gp in a group of breast cancer cases.</str>
      <str>Immunohistochemical reactions were performed using monoclonal antibodies against COX-2 and MDR1/P-gp on samples originating from 104 cases of primary invasive breast cancer.</str>
      <str>COX-2-positive cases were shown to demonstrate higher expression of MDR1/P-gp (P &lt; 0.0001). The studies also demonstrate that COX-2 expression was typical for cases of a higher grade (P = 0.01), a shorter overall survival time (P &lt; 0.0001) and a shorter progression-free time (P &lt; 0.0001). In the case of MDR1/P-gp, its higher expression characterised cases of a higher grade (P &lt; 0001), with lymph node involvement (P &lt; 0001), and shorter overall survival (P &lt; 0.0001) and progression-free time (P &lt; 0.0001).</str>
      <str>Our studies confirmed the unfavourable prognostic significance of COX-2 and MDR1/P-gp. We also document a relationship between COX-2 and MDR1/P-gp, which suggests that COX-2 inhibitors should be investigated in trials as a treatment supplementary to chemotherapy of breast cancers.</str>

      <str>Numerous studies have suggested a marked correlation between thyroid functionality indices and lipid metabolism. In this trial we assessed the functional parameters of 165 individuals over 70, 87 women and 78 men, correlating the serum values of T3, T4, FT4, TSH with cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, Apo-A and Apo-B levels. The correlation was performed over the whole population studied and subsequently, after dividing the population by sex and age (3 age groups: A, 70-75; B, 76-80; C, over 80) in the individual groups. In the population as a whole, we have observed a statistically significant correlation between T4/cholesterol (P=0.0001); T3/cholesterol (P=0.06); T4/triglycerides (P=0.0001); T3/triglycerides (P=0.09); T4/HDL (P=0.0001); T4/Apo-A (P= 0.02); T3/Apo-A (P=0.008); T4/Apo-B (P=0.0001). Analysis by gender shows a statistically significance between the female and male sexes in the correlation between T3/cholesterol (P=0.001); T3/triglycerides (P=0.06); T4/cholesterol (P=0.0001) and T4/triglycerides (P=0.0001). When the data were analyzed by age, in Group A (75-80) there was no statistically significant correlation, whereas in Group B (76-80) there has been an increase in significance in the correlation between T3/cholesterol (P=0.006); T3/triglycerides (P=0.001); T3/Hdl (P=0.08); T3/Apo-A (P=0.0001); T3/Apo-B (P=0.08); T4/cholesterol (P=0.00001) and ); T4/Apo-A (P=0.0001). On the other hand in the Group C age group (over 80) this significance is considerably lower. Maybe this decrease of correlations should be attributed to a global savings of the older organisms, or to a process of natural selection.</str>

      <str>Activities of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were determined in uterine artery and myometrium of uterine horn in ovariectomized pigs. It was considered that in uterine artery COMT activity increased after estradiol (E2) by 91.4% (p &lt; 0.01), after progesterone (P) by 194.3% (p &lt; 0.001) and after simultaneous administration of E2+P by 109.3% (p &lt; 0.01). In myometrium this activity rose after E2 by 56.3% (p &lt; 0.01) and after simultaneous using E2+P rose by 64.3% (p &lt; 0.01) in relation to COMT activity determined in ovariectomized animals (Control). MAO activity in uterine artery decreased by 55.4% after P (p &lt; 0.01) and also after simultaneous administration of E2+P by 58.7% (p &lt; 0.01). In myometrium this activity decreased after E2 by 35.5% (p &lt; 0.05) and after E2+P by 51.2% (p &lt; 0.01), whereas increased after P by 30.6% (p &lt; 0.05) in relation to MAO activity determined in control. Changes of MAO and COMT activities after E or P administration in ovariectomized animals denote that the hormones can participate in regulation of NA concentration in adrenergic synapse by the way of qualitative and quantitative changes of this mediator decomposition rate. E2 causes decrease of NA concentration in adrenergic synapse of uterine artery, whereas P operates the opposite way, as increaser.</str>

      <str>Phosphorus losses from arable soils contribute to eutrophication of freshwater systems. In addition to losses through surface runoff, leaching has lately gained increased attention as an important P transport pathway. Increased P levels in arable soils have highlighted the necessity of establishing a relationship between actual P leaching and soil P levels. In this study, we measured leaching of total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) during three years in undisturbed soil columns of five soils. The soils were collected at sites, established between 1957 and 1966, included in a long-term Swedish fertility experiment with four P fertilization levels at each site. Total P losses varied between 0.03 and 1.09 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), but no general correlation could be found between P concentrations and soil test P (Olsen P and phosphorus content in ammonium lactate extract [P-AL]) or P sorption indices (single-point phosphorus sorption index [PSI] and P sorption saturation) of the topsoil. Instead, water transport mechanism through the soil and subsoil properties seemed to be more important for P leaching than soil test P value in the topsoil. In one soil, where preferential flow was the dominant water transport pathway, water and P bypassed the high sorption capacity of the subsoil, resulting in high losses. On the other hand, P leaching from some soils was low in spite of high P applications due to high P sorption capacity in the subsoil. Therefore, site-specific factors may serve as indicators for P leaching losses, but a single, general indicator for all soil types was not found in this study.</str>

      <str>The volatile anesthetic agent enflurane undergoes oxidative metabolism in human liver, yielding both inorganic and organic fluoride metabolites. Numerous studies conducted in animals indicate that the enzyme cytochrome P-450 2E1 is a major catalyst for the defluorination reaction. However, the P-450 enzyme catalyzing enflurane metabolism in humans has not been identified. Therefore, experiments were conducted to determine whether hepatic P-450 2E1 is a catalyst for the reaction in humans, and whether other constitutive or inducible isoforms might also be involved. Purified human liver P-450 2E1, reconstituted with cytochrome b5 and P-450 reductase, catalyzed enflurane defluorination at a rate of 9.3 nmol F-/nmol P-450/30 min, in contrast to a mean liver microsomal rate of 2.0 nmol F-/nmol P-450/30 min. The microsomal rate of defluorination for individual human livers correlated significantly with the microsomal content of P-450 2E1 protein (r = 0.92), the rate of p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (r = 0.86), and the rate of chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (r = 0.90). In addition, specific anti-P-450 2E1 IgG, at a concentration of 10 mg IgG/nmol P-450 inhibited the microsomal reaction by 80%. Finally, a series of P-450 isoform-specific chemical inhibitors of oxidative metabolism--furafylline (1A2), sulfaphenazole (2C9/10), quinidine (2D6), troleandomycin (3A3/4), and diethyldithiocarbamate (2E1)--were screened for their ability to block human microsomal enflurane defluorination. Only diethyldithiocarbamate, a mechanism-based inhibitor of P-450 2E1, inhibited the reaction; this occurred to a degree comparable to the effect of anti-P-450 2E1 antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Four species of Pinus subsection Australes occur in the Caribbean Basin: P. caribaea, P. cubensis, P. maestrensis and P. occidentalis. This study analyses the phylogeography of these species to assess possible colonization events from Central America to the islands and subsequent population expansions during glacial periods driven by both drier climate and larger emerged land areas.</str>
      <str>Allele size data were obtained for plastid microsatellites for 314 individuals from 24 populations, covering the distribution range of subsection Australes in the Caribbean Basin.</str>
      <str>In total, 113 plastid haplotypes were identified. The highest genetic diversity was found in populations of P. caribaea. Overall, Caribbean Basin populations fit the isolation by distance model. Significant phylogeographical structure was found (R(ST) = 0·671 &gt; permuted R(ST) = 0·101; P &lt; 0·0001). The haplotype network and a Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS) indicated different Central American origins for P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. caribaea var. caribaea plastids, with Central America populations in northern and south-eastern groups. Sudden expansion times for BAPS clusters were close to three glacial maxima.</str>
      <str>Central America contains ancestral plastid haplotypes. Population expansion has played a major role in the distribution of genetic diversity in P. caribaea var. hondurensis. Two colonization events gave rise to the P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. caribaea var. caribaea lineages. Plastid variation in the eastern species (P. cubensis, P. maestrensis and P. occidentalis) evolved independently from that in P. caribaea var. caribaea. Incomplete lineage sorting between P. cubensis and P. maestrensis is apparent. Inferred expansion times for P. caribaea var. bahamensis and for the eastern lineages correspond to glacial maxima, whereas those for P. caribaea var. hondurensis correspond to the beginning of the temperature decrease that led to Marine Isotope Stage 8.</str>

      <str>Frequent comorbidity between panic disorder (PD) and mood disorders has been widely reported in clinical and epidemiological studies and, recently, an increasing attention has been paid to the cooccurrence of PD and bipolar disorder (BD). Several studies have shown that an imbalance of serotonin activity could be related to panic symptoms. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) are plausible candidates for the association with PD. The aim of this study is to investigate a possible association between TPH2 gene polymorphisms and the PD comorbidity susceptibility.Our sample consisted of 515 patients; 274 patients with BD (subtypes I and II), including 45 patients with lifetime panic disorder comorbidity and 241 controls. These patients were genotyped for eight tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene of human TPH2. We found significant differences between patients with BD, with panic disorder comorbidity, and controls in the allelic analysis (rs4448731, P=0.0069; rs4565946, P=0.0359; rs4760820, P=0.0079; rs1487275, P=0.0439) and genotypic analysis (rs4448731, P=0.011; rs4760820, P=0.0259). We also identified significant differences between patients with BD, with and without panic disorder comorbidity in the allelic analysis (rs4448731, P=0.004; rs4565946, P=0.011; rs11179000, P=0.031; rs4760820, P=0.018; rs1487275, P=0.038; rs10879357, P=0.023) and genotypic analysis (rs4448731, P=0.004; rs4565946, P=0.010; rs4760820, P=0.023; rs10879357, P=0.052). The haplotype analysis in the group of patients with BD, with and without panic disorder comorbidity, was also significant (rs4448731-rs4565946, P=0.0190; rs4448731-rs4565946, P=0.0220; rs10506645-rs4760820, P=0.0360).

      <str>In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) results in worse inpatient outcomes than in those without AF. Two electrocardiographic markers, maximum P wave duration (P(maximum)) and P wave dispersion (P(dispersion)), have been assessed because they reflect conduction abnormalities in patients with paroxysmal AF. b blockers are known to have beneficial effects in patients with ACS. This prospective study was conducted to investigate whether early intravenous (IV) metoprolol injection acutely decreases P(maximum) and P(dispersion) in patients with ACS. This study involved 100 consecutive patients with ACS who were divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they received early IV metoprolol. Group 1 consisted of 19 patients who received IV metoprolol within 3 h after onset of symptoms, and group 2 consisted of 81 patients who did not receive IV metoprolol within 3 h after symptom onset because of late admission. P(maximum) and P(dispersion) were measured on admission and again at 2 h after admission. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination was also performed. For patients who received early IV metoprolol, P(maximum) and P(dispersion), measured 2 h after admission, were shorter than values at admission (P&lt;.001). Conversely, P(maximum) and P(dispersion), measured 2 h after admission, did not differ significantly from values at admission in patients who did not receive early IV metoprolol (P=.292 and P=.236, respectively). IV administration of metoprolol reduced values for P(maximum) and P(dispersion), measured 2 h after admission, among patients with ACS who were admitted within 3 h after onset of symptoms.</str>

      <str>Catheter ablation has emerged as a widely used treatment modality for atrial fibrillation (AF). P-wave abnormalities have been described in the patients with AF, and catheter ablation may potentially further impact P-wave parameters due to ablation of atrial tissue.</str>
      <str>We reviewed data on P-wave parameters (P-wave duration, amplitude and P-wave duration and amplitude product) in leads V1 and aVF and changes in the P-terminal force (Ptf; product of duration and amplitude of terminal part of P-wave) in lead V1 from 12-lead electrocardiograms obtained prior to and after CA of a total of 46 (28 paroxysmal and 18 persistent) AF patients.</str>
      <str>The median age of patients in our study was 63 (range: 30-77) years. We noticed a significant reduction in the P-wave duration (from 87.39±28.62ms at baseline to 72.09±24.59ms; p=0.0072) and the product of P-wave duration and amplitude in lead V1 (12.16±5.54mVms at baseline to 8.30±5.78mVms, p=0.0015) after CA. There was also a significant decrease in P-wave duration (from 92.57±19.67ms at baseline to 76.48±16.32ms after CA, p=0.0001) and P-wave duration and amplitude product in lead aVF (12.61±4.05mVms at baseline to 9.77±3.86mVms after CA, p=0.0001). CA also led to a significant decrease in Ptf (from 4.56±1.88 at baseline to 2.85±1.42mVms, p&lt;0.0001).</str>
      <str>Radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF leads to modification of P-wave parameters with substantial diminution in both the amplitude and duration of the P-wave in leads V1 and aVF. This likely represents reduction in electrically active atrial tissue after ablation, and may serve as a marker for the extent of ablated atrial tissue.</str>

      <str>To assess the interaction of Pneumocystis carinii with dendritic cells (DCs), and the consequences of the response of the host immune system to P. carinii antigens when DC are pulsed with P. carinii, murine DC were pulsed with P. carinii, and the resultant P. carinii host responses assessed in vitro and in vivo. P. carinii interacted with murine bone marrow-derived DC in vitro in part via mannose receptors. DC pulsed with P. carinii did not demonstrate increased expression of the cell surface markers MHC II, CD40, CD54, CD80 (B7.1), and CD86 (B7.2). The release of interleukin (IL)-4 was increased, but there was no increase in the release of interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and nitrite compared with naive DC. In vivo administration of DC pulsed with P. carinii induced a P. carinii-specific response, generating CD4+ cells that proliferated and released IL-4, but not interferon-gamma, in response to P. carinii-pulsed DC in vitro. In vivo administration of DC pulsed with P. carinii also induced P. carinii-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, but not IgG3, antibodies in serum, and lung lavage fluid. Finally, CD4+ depleted mice immunized with DC pulsed with P. carinii demonstrated suppression of lung growth of P. carinii after intratracheal challenge with P. carinii at 3 and 16 weeks after immunization. These observations provide insight into DC-P. carinii interactions, and support the concept that a vaccine that includes DC pulsed with P. carinii can mount a humoral and T helper 2-type cellular response to P. carinii sufficient to suppress the growth of P. carinii in the lung.</str>

      <str>The median survival time was 20 months in all patients. Overall, five-year survival rate was 14.3%. The survival rate was significantly better in epithelioid mesothelioma (P=0.049). For EPP cases, the median survival rate was 17 months, and the three-to-five year survival rates were 21% and 17%, respectively. For E/P cases, the median survival rate was 27 months and the three-year and four-year survival rates were 34% and 30%, respectively. For P/D cases, the median survival rate was 15 months and the three-to-five year survival rate was 13% and 0%. There were no statistically significant differences between the three surgical techniques (P=0.088). A comparative analysis indicates only a statistically significant difference in the E/P and P/D comparison (P=0.032). Hospital mortality showed a higher trend in EPP group (EPP: 12.9%, E/P: 0% and P/D: 4%, P=0.145). N2 cases, there were no cases of two-year survival. The survival rate in N2 was comparatively much lower, which was statistically significant (P=0.005). In multivariate analysis, only P/D (OR 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9, P=0.049) and N2 (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6, P=0.090) were found to be poor prognostic factors.</str>

      <str>The Olsen-P status of grazed grassland (Lolium perenne L.) swards in Northern Ireland was increased over a 5-yr period (March 2000 to February 2005) by applying different rates of P fertilizer (0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) to assess the relationship between soil P status and P losses in land drainage water and overland flow. Plots (0.2 ha) were hydrologically isolated and artificially drained to v-notch weirs, with flow proportional monitoring of drainage water and overland flow. Annually, the collectors for overland flow intercepted between 11 and 35% of the surplus rainfall. Single flow events accounted for up to 52% of the annual dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) load. The Olsen-P status of the soil influenced DRP and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in land drainage water and overland flow. Annual TP loss was highly variable and ranged from 0.19 to 1.55 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) for the plot receiving no P fertilizer and from 0.35 to 2.94 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) for the plot receiving 80 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). Despite the Olsen-P status in the soils ranging from 22 to 99 mg P kg(-1), after 5 yr of fertilizer P applications it was difficult to identify a clear Olsen-P concentration at which P losses increased. Any relationship was confounded by annual variability of hydrologic events and flows and by hydrologic differences between plots. Withholding P fertilizer for over 5 yr was not long enough to lower P losses or to have an adverse effect on herbage P concentrations.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter, responsible for multidrug resistance in tumor cells. P-gp catalyzes the ATP hydrolysis-dependent efflux of numerous amphiphilic compounds of unrelated chemical structures. In the absence of any identified substrate, P-gp exhibits an apparently futile, basal ATPase activity. By using native membrane vesicles containing high amounts of P-gp, we show here that (i) this basal ATPase activity is tightly dependent on the presence of cholesterol in the membrane; (ii) the stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity by drugs transported by P-gp is higher in the absence than in the presence of cholesterol and, conversely, the stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity by cholesterol is higher in the absence than in the presence of known P-gp substrates; (iii) P-gp mediates the ATP-dependent relocation of cholesterol from the cytosolic leaflet to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane; and (iv) the decrease of the cholesterol dependence of P-gp ATPase activity induced by known P-gp substrates is correlated with the inhibition of the ATP-dependent cholesterol redistribution within the membrane. These data are highly evocative of a coupling between the basal ATPase activity of P-gp and its intramembrane cholesterol-redistribution function, and they are fully consistent with the possibility that P-gp may actively translocate cholesterol in the membrane. Finally, this P-gp-mediated cholesterol redistribution in the cell membrane makes it likely that P-gp contributes in stabilizing the cholesterol-rich microdomains, rafts and caveolae, and that it is involved in the regulation of cholesterol trafficking in cells.</str>

      <str>Twelve Boran steers with a mean live weight of 215.8 +/- 13.9 kg were used in an incomplete Latin Square experiment to compare the apparent phosphorus (P) absorption in cattle when Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) was supplemented with Busumbu rock phosphate (BRP), Minjingu rock phosphate (MRP), steamed bone meal (SBM) or a commercial mineral mix (CMM). The steers were housed individually and supplemented with P at 0, 4.5 or 17.5 g P/day. Dry matter intake (DMI) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) were not affected (p &gt; 0.05) by the source of P. Live weight gains (LWG) were different (p &lt; 0.05) across the sources of P. The coefficient for apparent P absorption from the supplement (CAPA), DMD and LWG decreased linearly (p &lt; 0.05) with period. Dry matter intakes were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) across periods. The level of P supplementation had no significant effect (p &gt; 0.05) on DMI or LWG. However, increasing the level of P supplementation significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) the DMD of the basal diet. There was also a significant (p &lt; 0.05) source x level interaction for CAPA. The CMM had the highest CAPA, which decreased from 106% to 74.7% with increasing level of P supplementation. For SBM, BRP and MRP, increasing P supplementation also increased CAPA. The CAPA for SBM and BRP and BRP and MRP were not significantly (p &gt; 0.05) different from each other. These results suggest that BRP has potential as a source of P for ruminants.</str>

      <str>The A4GALT locus encodes a glycosyltransferase that synthesizes the terminal Galα1-4Gal of the P(k) (Gb3/CD77) glycosphingolipid, important in transfusion medicine, obstetrics, and pathogen susceptibility. Critical nucleotide changes in A4GALT not only abolish P(k) formation but also another Galα1-4Gal-defined antigen, P1, which belongs to the only blood group system for which the responsible locus remains undefined. Since known A4GALT polymorphisms do not explain the P1-P(k)+ phenotype, P(2), we set out to elucidate the genetic basis of P(1)/P(2). Despite marked differences (P(1) &gt; P(2)) in A4GALT transcript levels in blood, luciferase experiments showed no difference between P(1)/P(2)-related promoter sequences. Investigation of A4GALT mRNA in cultured human bone marrow cells revealed novel transcripts containing only the noncoding exon 1 and a sequence (here termed exon 2a) from intron 1. These 5'-capped transcripts include poly-A tails and 3 polymorphic sites, one of which was P(1)/P(2)-specific among &gt; 200 donors and opens a short reading frame in P(2) alleles. We exploited these data to devise the first genotyping assays to predict P1 status. P(1)/P(2) genotypes correlated with both transcript levels and P1/P(k) expression on red cells. Thus, P(1) zygosity partially explains the well-known interindividual variation in P1 strength. Future investigations need to focus on regulatory mechanisms underlying P1 synthesis.</str>

      <str>To define if antibodies to ribosomal P proteins disclose a better lupus nephritis long-term survival.</str>
      <str>Sixty consecutive SLE patients with biopsy-proven nephritis (2004 ISN/RPS) were evaluated for renal survival parameters. Inclusion criteria were at least one serum sample at: renal flares, biopsy, and last follow-up until 2008. Anti-P was detected by ELISA/immunoblot and anti-dsDNA by indirect immunofluorescence/ELISA.</str>
      <str>Eleven patients (18%) with anti-P+ (without anti-dsDNA) during renal flare were compared to 49 (82%) persistently negative for anti-P throughout the study. At the final follow-up post-biopsy (6.3±2.5 vs. 6.8±2.4 years, p=0.36), the comparison of anti-P+/anti-dsDNA- with anti-P- group revealed a trend to lower mean creatinine levels (0.9±0.3 vs. 2.3±2.1 mg/dl, p=0.07), lower frequency of dialysis (0% vs. 35%, p=0.025), and higher frequency of normal renal function (91% vs. 53%, p=0.037). The overall renal survival was significantly higher in anti-P+/anti-dsDNA- compared to anti-P- (11.0±4.5 vs. 9.2±4.5 years, p=0.033), anti-dsDNA+/anti-P- (vs. 8.7±4.7 years, p=0.017), and anti-P-/anti-dsDNA- (vs. 9.8±4.3 years, p=0.09) groups.</str>
      <str>Our data supports the notion that anti-P antibody in the absence of anti-dsDNA during nephritis flares is a valuable marker to predict a better long-term renal outcome in lupus patients.</str>

      <str>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a 170 kDa transmembrane protein involved in the outward transport of many structurally unrelated substrates. P-gp activation/induction may function as an antidotal pathway to prevent the cytotoxicity of these substrates. In the present study we aimed at testing rifampicin (Rif) and three newly synthesized Rif derivatives (a mono-methoxylated derivative, MeORif, a peracetylated derivative, PerAcRif, and a reduced derivative, RedRif) to establish their ability to modulate P-gp expression and activity in a cellular model of the rat's blood-brain barrier, the RBE4 cell line P-gp expression was assessed by western blot using C219 anti-P-gp antibody. P-gp function was evaluated by flow cytometry measuring the accumulation of rhodamine123. Whenever P-gp activation/induction ability was detected in a tested compound, its antidotal effect was further tested using paraquat as cytotoxicity model. Interactions between Rif or its derivatives and P-gp were also investigated by computational analysis. Rif led to a significant increase in P-gp expression at 72 h and RedRif significantly increased both P-gp expression and activity. No significant differences were observed for the other derivatives. Pre- or simultaneous treatment with RedRif protected cells against paraquat-induced cytotoxicity, an effect reverted by GF120918, a P-gp inhibitor, corroborating the observed P-gp activation ability. Interaction of RedRif with P-gp drug-binding pocket was consistent with an activation mechanism of action, which was confirmed with docking studies. Therefore, RedRif protection against paraquat-induced cytotoxicity in RBE4 cells, through P-gp activation/induction, suggests that it may be useful as an antidote for cytotoxic substrates of P-gp. </str>
