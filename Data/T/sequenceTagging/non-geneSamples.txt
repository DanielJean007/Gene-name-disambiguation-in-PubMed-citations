The murine developmental mutation T identifies a gene required in 
T T mutant embryos develop normally 
We have localized the T mutation relative to DNA markers 
human gene encoding the transcription factor T 
Brachyury mutant mice which lack T protein die in utero with 
We have identified human T genomic clones and derived the 
acid identity between human and mouse T proteins overall and complete identity 
across 77 amino acids of the T box motif within the DNA 
Human T expression is very similar to 
very similar to that found for T in other vertebrate species and 
identify variants in all PAX3 and T exons and promoter regions in 
variants in PAX3 n 2 and T n 3 for which the

Expression of the endogenous genes for T and MITF was initiated implying 
we therefore analysed Eomes and Brachyury T which had been controversially discussed 
positive population emerges from the Brachyury T positive fraction 
type mouse embryos confirmed that Brachyury T colocalises with MesP1 in vivo 
Likewise shRNA based loss of Brachyury T causes a dramatic decrease in 
via in situ hybridizations using Brachyury T knock out embryos where MesP1 
directly bound and activated by Brachyury T via a T responsive element

7% tumours displayed amplification of the T locus and an additional two 
showed a minor allelic gain of T as assessed by FISH 
No germline alteration of the T locus was identified in non 
Copy number gain of T was seen in a similar 
Knockdown of T in the cell line U

Sequencing of T in the affected individuals led

Brachyury specific T cells could lyse Brachyury positive 
We previously identified germline T duplication as a major susceptibility 
We sequenced all T exons in 24 familial cases 
from eight chordoma families three with T duplications 103 sporadic cases and 
We also measured T copy number variation in all 
Finally we did not observe T duplication in any sporadic chordoma

Immunohistochemistry for the transcription factor brachyury T has recently proven diagnostically useful 
and the ability of brachyury specific T cells to lyse human breast 
We also demonstrated that brachyury specific T cells can lyse human breast
