Expression of the T gene is restricted to nascent 
Recent results suggest that the T gene encodes a nuclear factor 
The duplicated region contains only the T brachyury gene which is important 
The human T gene maps to chromosome 6q27

We hypothesize that epistatic interactions between T and other developmental genes and
