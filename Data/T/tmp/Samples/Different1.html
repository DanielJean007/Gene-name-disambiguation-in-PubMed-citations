<str>The histological comparative study was performed on chordoma and notochordal cell rests (NCRs).</str>
<str>To understand the histological similarity and homology of chordoma and NCRs, further supplying direct evidence of chordoma origin from NCRs.</str>
<str>Although many studies supported the hypothesis that chordoma arise from NCRs, there has been little direct evidence reported to date. Of the base of our previous study, we conducted a comparative histological study among NCRs coexisting in chordoma, fetal NCRs, and chordoma tumor components.</str>
<str>Thirty fetal nucleus pulposus and 46 chordoma specimens were harvested, and classic chordoma tumor markers and brachyury expression levels were investigated through immunohistochemical method.</str>
<str>The fetal NCRs existed in the form of clusters in the center of nucleus pulposus &lt;36 gestational weeks; NCRs coexisting in chordoma specimens consisted of packed cells without extracellular myxoid matrix. Both the above-mentioned NCRs as well as chordoma tumor components showed high sensitivity for classic chordoma tumor makers (epithelial membrane antigen, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, vimentin, S-100); both kinds of NCRs showed completely negative expression for brachyury, whereas chordoma tumor components demonstrated 100% positivity.</str>

<str>Increasing numbers of studies support the hypothesis that chordoma arises from notochordal cell rests, although the mechanism awaits further research. Brachyury is the first specific molecule linking chordoma with the notochord, and galectin-3 has been widely used as a marker of notochordal cells. We conducted a histological study of the expression of these two molecules in 46 classic chordoma specimens and unexpectedly found that classic chordoma tumor cells coexisted with benign notochordal cell rests in six specimens. Brachyury and galectin-3 expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. All specimens contained atypical chordoma tumor cells set within an abundant myxoid matrix, which strongly expressed brachyury and galectin-3. However, brachyury and galectin-3 were not expressed in the notochordal cells. Benign notochordal cells, present as notochord rests, could undergo malignant transformation to form chordoma; however, the cause and role of brachyury and galectin-3 expression in chordoma tumorigenesis requires further careful study.</str>

<str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumour of bone showing notochordal differentiation with characteristic expression of the transcription factor brachyury (T). Next to giving insight into its differentiation spectrum, the expression of T can be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool. The expression of brachyury in chordoma is necessary to maintain cell proliferation in chordoma cell lines, indicating that in chordoma it might be a master regulator of oncogenesis. Identification and mapping of the full gene regulatory network in a recent work in The Journal of Pathology by Nelson and colleagues not only shed light on involved pathways but also indicated pathways for targeted therapy, including brachyury itself.</str>

<str>Brachyury is a transcription factor which is required for posterior mesoderm formation and differentiation as well as for notochord development during embryogenesis. Due to its expression in the neoplastic cells of chordoma, a malignant tumour deriving from notochordal remnants, but not in tumors showing a similar histology, brachyury has been proposed as a diagnostic marker of this neoplasia. Though commonly considered a hallmark of chordoma, the expression of brachyury has been also documented in the stromal cells of hemangioblastoma (HBL), a slow growing tumor which may involve the central nervous system (CNS) and, rarely, the kidney. Herein we review the role of brachyury immunohistochemical detection in the identification and differential diagnosis of chordoma and HBL towards histological mimickers and suggest that brachyury is added to the panel of immunohistochemical markers for the recognition of HBL in routinary practice, principally in unusual sites. </str>

<str>Recent evidence suggests that the expression of brachyury is necessary for chordoma growth. However, the mechanism associated with brachyury-regulated cell growth is poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a regulator of brachyury expression in normal tissue, may also play an important role in chordoma pathophysiology. Using a panel of chordoma cell lines, we explored the role of FGF signaling and brachyury in cell growth and survival. Western blots showed that all chordoma cell lines expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), FGFR3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), whereas no cell lines expressed FGFR1 and FGFR4. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that chordoma cells produced FGF2. Neutralization of FGF2 inhibited MEK/ERK phosphorylation, decreased brachyury expression and induced apoptosis while reducing cell growth. Activation of the FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway by FGF2-initiated phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2)-Î± (Tyr196) prevented apoptosis while promoting cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immunofluorescence staining showed that FGF2 promoted the translocation of phosphorylated ERK to the nucleus and increased brachyury expression. The selective inhibition of FGFR, MEK and ERK phosphorylation by PD173074, PD0325901 and PD184352, respectively, decreased brachyury expression, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth and EMT. Moreover, knockdown of brachyury by small hairpin RNA reduced FGF2 secretion, inhibited FGFR/MEK/ERK phosphorylation and blocked the effects of FGF2 on cell growth, apoptosis and EMT. Those findings highlight that FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway coordinately regulates chordoma cell growth and survival and may represent a novel chemotherapeutic target for chordoma.</str>

<str>A small number of tumors bearing histological resemblance to axial chordoma arising from the bone or soft tissue outside the axial skeleton have been reported. These lesions have historically been referred to as parachordoma, chordoma periphericum (CP), or extra-axial chordoma (EAC). With the introduction of the immunohistochemical stain brachyury, a sensitive and specific marker for notochordal origin, chordomas arising in extra-axial locations (i.e., CP, EAC), are now diagnosed with more accuracy and distinguished from parachordoma, which resembles chordoma on histology. The distinction between EAC and parachordoma is clinically important because EAC confirmed by immunoreactivity for brachyury tends to grow and recur with local bone destruction. Prior to the introduction of brachyury, the diagnosis of EAC was challenging and therefore the imaging features of EAC have not been comprehensively described. We report two cases of recurrent EAC confirmed by the expression of brachyury arising from the distal femur and distal tibia and describe the imaging findings from radiography and MRI at initial diagnosis and at recurrence. </str>

<str>Chordoma is a rare, but often malignant, bone cancer that preferentially affects the axial skeleton and the skull base. These tumors are both sporadic and hereditary and appear to occur more frequently after the fourth decade of life; however, modern technologies have increased the detection of pediatric chordomas. Chordomas originate from remnants of the notochord, the main embryonic axial structure that precedes the backbone, and share with notochord cells both histological features and the expression of characteristic genes. One such gene is Brachyury, which encodes for a sequence-specific transcription factor. Known for decades as a main regulator of notochord formation, Brachyury has recently gained interest as a biomarker and causative agent of chordoma, and therefore as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we review the main characteristics of chordoma, the molecular markers, and the clinical approaches currently available for the early detection and possible treatment of this cancer. In particular, we report on the current knowledge of the role of Brachyury and of its possible mechanisms of action in both notochord formation and chordoma etiogenesis.</str>

<str>Brachyury is recognized as a specific marker for notochord-derived tissues and neoplasms, and has become a defining immunohistochemical feature of chordoma. The main differential diagnostic consideration for chordoma is chondrosarcoma, which is known to lack brachyury expression. However, within the spectrum of genitourinary neoplasia, metastatic germ cell tumors and clear cell renal cell carcinoma may also be close morphological mimics of chordoma, particularly given the increasing prevalence of small tissue samples from image-guided biopsies. Although immunoreactivity for brachyury has been reported in a few germ cell tumors, a thorough characterization of staining by specific subtype has not been performed in a large series. Additionally, brachyury expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma has not been well studied. In this study, immunohistochemical expression with the brachyury antibody was evaluated in 111 germ cell tumors, 30 non-neoplastic and neoplastic (non-germ cell) testicular tissues, and 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas using tissue microarray technology. In addition, immunoreactivity for PAX-8 and SALL-4 was evaluated in 12 chordomas on whole section. No nuclear brachyury expression was identified in any of the 101 germ cell tumors within the tissue microarray (including choriocarcinoma (1), embryonal carcinoma (20), intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (2), seminoma (64), spermatocytic seminoma (1), teratoma (5) and yolk sac tumor (8)), in any of the 30 non-neoplastic and neoplastic (non-germ cell) testicular tissues, or in any of the 10 whole-section seminomas. All 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas were also non-reactive for brachyury. All 12 chordomas showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity for brachyury, but no expression of SALL-4. In all, 1 of 12 chordoma cases showed patchy, 1+ nuclear immunoreactivity for PAX-8. This study confirms the specificity of brachyury for chordoma in the differential diagnostic distinction from the potential genitourinary mimics, germ cell tumors and metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</str>

<str>Chordomas are invasive tumors that develop from notochordal remnants and frequently occur in the skull base. The T gene and its product (brachyury) have recently been suggested to play an important role in chordoma progression. To date, few studies have investigated the relationship between the molecular/genetic characteristics of chordoma and patient prognosis. We analyzed 37 skull base chordomas for chromosomal copy number aberrations using comparative genomic hybridization, brachyury expression by immunohistochemistry, and T gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results of these molecular analyses and clinical parameters were compared with the patients' clinical courses. Univariate analyses using the log-rank test demonstrated that losses on chromosome 1p and gains on 1q and 2p were negatively correlated with progression-free survival, as were factors such as female sex, partial tumor removal, lack of postoperative irradiation, and high MIB-1 index. Expression of brachyury and copy number gain of the T gene were also significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox hazards model showed that lack of irradiation, gain on chromosome 2p, and expression of brachyury were independently associated with a poor prognosis. Our results suggest that brachyury-negative chordomas arebiologically distinct from brachyury-positive chordomas and that T/brachyury might be an appropriate molecular therapeutic target for chordoma. </str>

<str>The 51 chordomas occurred in 36 men and 15 women. Sitewise, 34 cases (66.7%) occurred in the sacrococcyx, 9 (17.6%) in the spine, and 8 (15.7%) in the skull base. Histologically, 34 cases (66.7%) were classical chordomas, 13 cases (25.5%) had a dominant chondroid component, and 2 cases each (3.9%) were chondroid chordomas and dedifferentiated chordomas, respectively. Brachyury staining was positive in 46 of the 51 chordomas (90.2%) and negative in all 58 nonchordomatous tumors. The dedifferentiated area in 2 chordomas was negative for brachyury staining. Fourteen of 15 chordomas with chondroid component showed positive brachyury staining. Immunohistochemical expression of other markers, included cytokeratin (positive in 23 of 23 cases; 100%), epithelial membrane antigen (positive in 22 of 22 cases; 100%) and S100 protein (positive in 18 of 21 cases; 85.7%).</str>

<str>Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumours considered to arise from notochordal remnants that persist in the axial skeleton. Although their morphology can resemble that of a carcinoma, chondrosarcoma or malignant melanoma, the axial location and their well-defined immunophenotype, including expression of cytokeratins (CK7/20/8/18/19) and S100, generally allow the diagnosis to be made with confidence once the possibility is considered. In contrast, making a robust diagnosis of an extra-axial chordoma has been difficult in the absence of specific markers for chordomas. We have recently shown in gene expression microarray and immunohistochemistry studies that brachyury, a transcription factor crucial for notochordal development, is a specific and sensitive maker for chordomas. We now present a case of an intracortical tibial tumour, with detailed report of the imaging, and morphological features consistent with a chordoma, where notochordal differentiation was demonstrated with an antibody to brachyury. The tumour cells were also positive for cytokeratins, including CK19, and S100, CEA, EMA and HMBE1, findings which support the diagnosis of chordoma. Brachyury can be employed as a marker of notochordal differentiation and help identify confidently, for the first time, extra-axial bone and soft tissue chordomas, and tumours which may show focal notochordal differentiation.</str>

<str>Brachyury is a transcription factor of the T-box family typically expressed in notochord and chordoma. Some studies report brachyury as highly specific for chordoma, whereas others have concluded that brachyury is expressed in many types of common carcinomas by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and could be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic process. In this study, we immunohistochemically evaluated 5229 different tumors for nuclear brachyury expression using a new rabbit monoclonal antibody and automated immunostaining (Leica Bond Max). Only nuclear labeling was scored, and antibody dilution of 1:2000 was used. In normal tissues, only rare cells in seminiferous tubules were labeled; all other organs were negative. All chordomas (75/76), except a sarcomatous one, were positive, whereas chondrosarcomas were negative. Among epithelial tumors, positivity was often detected in embryonal carcinoma (74%) and seminoma (45%). Pulmonary small cell carcinoma was often positive (41%), whereas pulmonary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas only rarely showed nuclear brachyury positivity (3% to 4%). Common carcinomas such as ductal carcinomas of the breast or adenocarcinomas of the prostate only exceptionally showed nuclear positivity (&lt;1%). No colorectal, hepatocellular, renal cell, squamous cell, thyroid or urothelial carcinoma, or mesothelioma showed nuclear brachyury positivity. Among mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors, only isolated cases of melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and follicular lymphoma showed nuclear expression. However, as shown previously with lung carcinoma, experiments with lower antibody dilutions (1:200 to 1:500) showed weak cytoplasmic and nuclear labeling in breast cancers. In addition to chordoma, we show here for the first time that nuclear brachyury expression is prevalent in embryonal carcinoma, seminoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lung but very rare in common carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanoma. With these reservations, we have demonstrated the presence of nuclear brachyury immunoreactivity to be a sensitive and fairly specific marker for chordoma. </str>

<str>Chordoma, and its relationship to the notochord, has intrigued many researchers over the last two centuries. In particular, the morphological overlap with cartilaginous tumours is striking, and developmental biology has shown a tight relationship between cartilage and the notochord. This is reflected in the expression of common genes in chordoid and chondroid tumours. Wide gene expression analyses have led to the identification of key molecules that might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chordoma. Brachyury, a key factor in notochord fate, is significantly differentially expressed in chordoma. This not only gives insight into the histogenesis of this tumour but may also point towards new diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis between chordoid and chondroid tumours.</str>

In this study, therefore, we compared the transcriptional expression profile of one sacral chordoma recurrence, two chordoma cell lines (U-CH1 and U-CH2) and one chondrosarcoma cell line (U-CS2) with vertebral disc using a high-density oligonucleotide array. The expression of 65 genes whose mRNA levels differed significantly (p&lt;0.001; â¥6-fold change) between chordoma and control (vertebral disc) was identified. Genes with increased expression in chordoma compared to control and chondrosarcoma were most frequently located on chromosomes 2 (11%), 5 (8%), 1 and 7 (each 6%), whereas interphase cytogenetics of 33 chordomas demonstrated gains of chromosomal material most prevalent on 7q (42%), 12q (21%), 17q (21%), 20q (27%) and 22q (21%). The microarray data were confirmed for selected genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. As in other studies, we showed the expression of brachyury. We demonstrate the expression of new potential candidates for chordoma tumorigenesis, such as CD24, ECRG4, RARRES2, IGFBP2, RAP1, HAI2, RAB38, osteopontin, GalNAc-T3, VAMP8 and others. Thus, we identified and validated a set of interesting candidate genes whose differential expression likely plays a role in chordoma.</str>

<str>Patients with skull base chordomas have a poor prognosis, and the role of the protein expression of brachyury in chordomas remains to be fully elucidated. The present study used immunohistochemistry to analyze 57 cases of skull base chordoma, and analyzed the clinical data of the patients. The results demonstrated that the protein expression of brachyury was negative in 8.8% (5/57) of the cases. The weak/positive, positive and strong/positive rates were 5.3% (3/57), 21.1% (12/57) and 64.9% (37/57), respectively. The association between the expression of brachyury and recurrence was not statistically significant. KaplanâMeier analysis revealed that the degree of surgery, rather than the expression of brachyury, was associated with tumor recurrence (P=0.001). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of Brachyury offers a sensitive marker, but not a risk factor, for skull base chordomas, and radical surgery is recommended.</str>

<str>Chordoma cells can generate solid-like tumors in xenograft models that express some molecular characteristics of the parent tumor, including positivity for brachyury and cytokeratins. However, there is a dearth of molecular markers that relate to chordoma tumor growth, as well as the cell lines needed to advance treatment. The objective in this study was to isolate a novel primary chordoma cell source and analyze the characteristics of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model for comparison with the established U-CH1 and U-CH2b cell lines.</str>
<str>Primary cells from a sacral chordoma, called "DVC-4," were cultured alongside U-CH1 and U-CH2b cells for more than 20 passages and characterized for expression of CD24 and brachyury. While brachyury is believed essential for driving tumor formation, CD24 is associated with healthy nucleus pulposus cells. Each cell type was subcutaneously implanted in NOD/SCID/IL2RÎ³(null) mice. The percentage of solid tumors formed, time to maximum tumor size, and immunostaining scores for CD24 and brachyury (intensity scores of 0-3, heterogeneity scores of 0-1) were reported and evaluated to test differences across groups.</str>
<str>The DVC-4 cells retained chordoma-like morphology in culture and exhibited CD24 and brachyury expression profiles in vitro that were similar to those for U-CH1 and U-CH2b. Both U-CH1 and DVC-4 cells grew tumors at rates that were faster than those for U-CH2b cells. Gross tumor developed at nearly every site (95%) injected with U-CH1 and at most sites (75%) injected with DVC-4. In contrast, U-CH2b cells produced grossly visible tumors in less than 50% of injected sites. Brachyury staining was similar among tumors derived from all 3 cell types and was intensely positive (scores of 2-3) in a majority of tissue sections. In contrast, differences in the pattern and intensity of staining for CD24 were noted among the 3 types of cell-derived tumors (p &lt; 0.05, chi-square test), with evidence of intense and uniform staining in a majority of U-CH1 tumor sections (score of 3) and more than half of the DVC-4 tumor sections (scores of 2-3). In contrast, a majority of sections from U-CH2b cells stained modestly for CD24 (scores of 1-2) with a predominantly heterogeneous staining pattern.</str>
<str>This is the first report on xenografts generated from U-CH2b cells in which a low tumorigenicity was discovered despite evidence of chordoma-like characteristics in vitro. For tumors derived from a primary chordoma cell and U-CH1 cell line, similarly intense staining for CD24 was observed, which may correspond to their similar potential to grow tumors. In contrast, U-CH2b tumors stained less intensely for CD24. These results emphasize that many markers, including CD24, may be useful in distinguishing among chordoma cell types and their tumorigenicity in vivo.</str>

<str>Chordomas are malignant tumours that occur along the spine and are thought to derive from notochordal remnants. There is significant morphological variability between and within chordomas, with some showing prominent areas of chondroid differentiation. Our microarray data from a broad range of connective tissue neoplasms indicate that, at the transcriptional level, chordomas resemble cartilaginous neoplasms. Here we show that chordomas express many genes known to be involved in cartilage development, but they also uniquely express genes distinguishing them from chondroid neoplasms. The brachyury transcription factor, known to be involved in notochordal development, is only expressed by chordomas. Using a polyclonal antibody, we show that brachyury is expressed in the embryonic notochord and in all 53 chordomas analysed, labelling both chondroid and chordoid areas of these tumours. In contrast, the protein was not detected in over 300 neoplasms, including 163 chondroid tumours. Brachyury was not detected in the nucleus pulposus, arguing against the hypothesis that this tissue derives directly from the notochord. These data provide compelling evidence that chordomas derive from notochord and demonstrate that brachyury is a specific marker for the notochord and notochord-derived tumours.</str>

<str>Chordomas are midline tumors that arise from embryonic remnants of the notochord and are considered to be malignant tumors because of their tendency to invade and destroy the involved bone. Cases of intradural chordomas without bone involvement have been rarely described with a predilection for prepontine location. The absence of bony invasion renders the complete excision of these tumors more feasible and is related to their better prognosis in comparison to conventional chordomas. Herein we report the first intradural chordoma arising in the Meckel's cave. The intradural location of the lesion, outside midline structures, in the absence of bone infiltration, made the differential diagnosis versus other meningeal lesions such as chordoid meningioma challenging. The intense and strong immunohistochemical expression of pan-cytokeratins, S100, cytokeratin-19 and of the notochordal marker brachyury allowed differential diagnosis toward other tumors showing chordoid morphology. The expression of brachyury, which had not been previously analyzed in intradural chordoma, definitely links the histogenesis of this neoplasia to the notochord, similar to that of conventional chordoma. We also show that, different from conventional chordoma, intradural chordoma does not express the metallo-proteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9, which may account for its indolent biological behavior.</str>

<str>To investigate the clinical and pathologic characteristics of primary intradural retroclival chordoma and improve the understanding of this rare disease.</str>
<str>A retrospective study was conducted on six cases patients withof an intradural chordoma in the retroclival region who underwent surgery and were confirmed by pathology and imaging. Expression of brachyury, galectin-3, and Ki-67 in paraffin-embedded sections of the specimens was detected by streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry.</str>
<str>Lesions were located in the subdural prepontine cistern. Computed tomography scan showed that the bone of the skull base was not destroyed, and findings on magnetic resonance imaging varied, resulting in a misdiagnosis of 50% of the cases in the preoperative imaging. All six cases were classified by their pathology into the classical subtype. They presented a strong positive staining for brachyury and galectin-3, and the Ki-67 labeling index was between 2.5% and 8.2%. Three cases presented no signs of recurrence or regrowth, whereas in the other three patients recurrence or regrowth occurred at 7 â¼ 14 months after initial surgery. Two patients died of this disease.</str>
<str>Our study suggests that a positive staining for brachyury, galectin-3, and Ki-67 would be helpful for differential diagnosis, discriminating intradural retroclival chordoma from ecchordosis physaliphora and chordoid meningioma. Our study also shows that within intradural retroclival chordoma, there are significant prognostic differences. Tumors with an abundant blood supply, flake-like cellular arrangement, and a Ki-67 labeling index greater than 5% belong to a rapid-growth type and are prone to short-term recurrence and poorer prognosis.</str>

<str>Skull base chordomas are challenging tumors due to their deep surgical location and resistance to conventional radiotherapy. Chemotherapy plays a marginal role in the treatment of chordoma resulting from lack of preclinical models due to the difficulty in establishing tumor cell lines and valuable in vivo models. Here, we established a cell line from a recurrent clival chordoma. Cells were cultured for more than 30 passages and the expression of the chordoma cell marker brachyury was monitored using both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Sensitivity of chordoma cells to the inhibition of specific signaling pathways was assessed through testing of a commercially available small molecule kinase inhibitor library. In vivo tumorigenicity was evaluated by grafting chordoma cells onto immunocompromised mice and established tumor xenografts were treated with rapamycin. Rapamycin was administered to the donor patient and its efficacy was assessed on follow-up neuroimaging. Chordoma cells maintained brachyury expression at late passages and generated xenografts closely mimicking the histology and phenotype of the parental tumor. Rapamycin was identified as an inhibitor of chordoma cell proliferation. Molecular analyses on tumor cells showed activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and mutation of KRAS gene. Rapamycin was also effective in reducing the growth of chordoma xenografts. On the basis of these results, our patient received rapamycin therapy with about six-fold reduction of the tumor growth rate upon 10-month follow-up neuroimaging. This is the first case of chordoma in whom chemotherapy was tailored on the basis of the sensitivity of patient-derived tumor cells. </str>

<str>The distinction between chondrosarcoma and chordoma of the skull base/head and neck is prognostically important; however, both have sufficient morphologic overlap to make delineation difficult. As a result of gene expression studies, additional candidate markers have been proposed to help in separating those entities. We sought to evaluate the performance of new markers: brachyury, SOX-9, and podoplanin alongside the more traditional markers glial fibrillary acid protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CD24, and epithelial membrane antigen. Paraffin blocks from 103 skull base/head and neck chondroid tumors from 70 patients were retrieved (1969-2007). Diagnoses were made based on morphology and/or whole-section immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and S100 protein yielding 79 chordomas (comprising 45 chondroid chordomas and 34 conventional chordomas), and 24 chondrosarcomas. A tissue microarray containing 0.6 mm cores of each tumor in triplicate was constructed using a manual array (MTA-1; Beecher Instruments). For visualization of staining, the ImmPRESS detection system (Vector Laboratories) with 2-diaminobenzidine substrate was used. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each marker. Core loss from the microarray ranged from 25 to 29% yielding 66-78 viable cases per stain. The classic marker, cytokeratin, still has the best performance characteristics. When combined with brachyury, accuracy improves slightly (sensitivity and specificity for detection of chordoma 98 and 100%, respectively). Positivity for both epithelial membrane antigen and AE1/AE3 had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100% for detecting chordoma in this study. SOX-9 is apparently common to both notochordal and cartilaginous differentiation, and is not useful in the chordoma-chondrosarcoma differential diagnosis. Glial fibrillary acid protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CD24, and epithelial membrane antigen did not outperform other markers, and are less useful in the diagnosis of chordoma vs chondrosarcoma. Podoplanin still remains the only positive marker for chondrosarcoma, though its accuracy is less than previously reported.</str>

<str>Chordomas are rare primary bone tumors that occur along the neuraxis. Primary treatment is surgery, often followed by radiotherapy. Treatment options for patients with recurrence are limited and, notably, there are no FDA approved therapeutic agents. Development of therapeutic options has been limited by the paucity of preclinical model systems. We have established and previously reported the initial characterization of the first patient-derived chordoma xenograft model. In this study, we further characterize this model and demonstrate that it continues to resemble the original patient tumor histologically and immunohistochemically, maintains nuclear expression of brachyury, and is highly concordant with the original patient tumor by whole genome genotyping. Pathway analysis of this xenograft demonstrates activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In vitro studies demonstrate that two small molecule inhibitors of EGFR, erlotinib and gefitinib, inhibit proliferation of the chordoma cell line U-CH 1. We further demonstrate that erlotinib significantly inhibits chordoma growth in vivo. Evaluation of tumors post-treatment reveals that erlotinib reduces phosphorylation of EGFR. This is the first demonstration of antitumor activity in a patient-derived chordoma xenograft model and these findings support further evaluation of EGFR inhibitors in this disease. </str>

<str>Extra-axial chordomas are rare low-grade malignant tumors thought to arise from notochordal remnants in the extra-axial skeleton. Few studies have been done on this neoplasm because of its rarity. In addition, there is a lack of a good in vitro model on which to perform more characterization.</str>
<str>We describe a twenty-eight-year-old man with a mass in the right scapula. Cytomorphology and immunohistochemistry, including brachyury staining, were used to formulate the final diagnosis. A fragment of the tumor was placed in culture, and cells obtained were injected subcutaneously in an immunocompromised mouse. From the tumor developed in mice, a cell line has been derived and characterized by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, karyotyping, clonogenicity, and cell and tumor growth curves.</str>
<str>Cytomorphology on the tumor showed nests of round cells with vacuoles and also physaliferous-like cells with uniform nuclei. Immunochemistry revealed a tumor positive for vimentin, moderately positive for S-100 and cytokeratin AE1/AE3, weakly positive for epithelial membrane antigen, and negative for p63 and cytokeratin (CK)-7. Further analysis revealed the tumor was diffusely and strongly positive for brachyury. The cell line derived from the tumor showed rapid doubling-time, a strong expression of mesenchymal cell surface markers, a karyotype of diploid or hypotetraploid clones with numerous chromosomal aberrations, and the ability to form colonies without attachment and to form tumors in immunocompromised mice.</str>
<str>The diagnosis of the extra-axial chordoma is difficult but can be resolved by the detection of a strong brachyury expression. In addition, the derivation of a human extra-axial chordoma cell line could be a useful tool for the basic research of this rare neoplasm.</str>

<str>The molecular events in chordoma pathogenesis have not been fully delineated, particularly with respect to copy number changes. Understanding copy number alterations in chordoma may reveal critical disease mechanisms that could be exploited for tumor classification and therapy. We report the copy number analysis of 21 sporadic chordomas using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Recurrent copy changes were further evaluated with immunohistochemistry, methylation specific PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR. Similar to previous findings, large copy number losses, involving chromosomes 1p, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 18, were more common than copy number gains. Loss of CDKN2A with or without loss of CDKN2B on 9p21.3 was observed in 16/20 (80%) unique cases of which six (30%) showed homozygous deletions ranging from 76 kilobases to 4.7 megabases. One copy loss of the 10q23.31 region which encodes PTEN was found in 16/20 (80%) cases. Loss of CDKN2A and PTEN expression in the majority of cases was not attributed to promoter methylation. Our sporadic chordoma cases did not show hotspot point mutations in some common cancer gene targets. Moreover, most of these sporadic tumors are not associated with T (brachyury) duplication or amplification. Deficiency of CDKN2A and PTEN expression, although shared across many other different types of tumors, likely represents a key aspect of chordoma pathogenesis. Sporadic chordomas may rely on mechanisms other than copy number gain if they indeed exploit T/brachyury for proliferation.</str>

<str>A variety of analyses, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and array CGH (aCGH), have been performed on a series of chordomas from 181 patients. Twelve of 181 (7%) tumours displayed amplification of the T locus and an additional two cases showed focal amplification; 70/181 (39%) tumours were polysomic for chromosome 6, and 8/181 (4.5%) primary tumours showed a minor allelic gain of T as assessed by FISH. No germline alteration of the T locus was identified in non-neoplastic tissue from 40 patients. Copy number gain of T was seen in a similar percentage of sacrococcygeal, mobile spine and base of skull tumours. Knockdown of T in the cell line, U-CH1, which showed polysomy of chromosome 6 involving 6q27, resulted in a marked decrease in cell proliferation and morphological features consistent with a senescence-like phenotype. The U-CH1 cell line was validated as representing chordoma by the generation of xenografts, which showed typical chordoma morphology and immunohistochemistry in the NOD/SCID/interleukin 2 receptor [IL2r]gammanull mouse model. In conclusion, chromosomal aberrations resulting in gain of the T locus are common in sporadic chordomas and expression of this gene is critical for proliferation of chordoma cells in vitro.</str>

<str>Somatic alterations in the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 were first described in the malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) of infancy. Since then, SMARCB1 alterations have been found in other tumors, forming a varied group of SMARCB1-deficient tumors, which sometimes shares overlapping immunohistochemical and histological findings. Thus, the diagnosis is challenging. We report two cases of pediatric SMARCB1-deficient tumors from the clivus that illustrate the diagnostic difficulties. Both cases were strongly positive for epithelial markers associated with loss of BAF47 (INI1) expression, and were negative for S100 and CD34. Molecular analyses of the SMARCB1 gene found a deletion of all nine exons in both cases. In the first case, a 5-year-old girl presented with a thoracic metastasis of a clival tumor, which was diagnosed as MRT and treated accordingly. The morphological findings and the expression of brachyury would favor the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated chordoma. The second case was a quickly fatal clival tumor in a 2-year-old boy: This tumor was morphologically undifferentiated and raises the problem of differential diagnosis between an MRT, a malignant myoepithelial tumor, or an undifferentiated chordoma due to the location and the expression of brachyury. Studies of biological signatures, such as transcriptome profiling, could help to understand the apparent overlap between these tumors. </str>

<str>Chordomas are locally aggressive bone tumors known to arise from the remnants of the notochord. Because chordomas are rare, molecular studies aimed at developing new therapies are scarce and new approaches are needed. Chordoma cells and cancer stem-like cells share similar characteristics, including self-renewal, differentiation, and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, it seems possible that chordomas might contain a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells. The aim of this study is to determine whether cancer stem-like cells might be present in chordomas.</str>
<str>In this study, the authors used gene expression analysis for common cancer stem-like cellmarkers, including c-myc, SSEA-1, oct4, klf4, sox2, nanog, and brachyury, and compared chordoma cells and tissues with nucleus pulposus tissues (disc degenerated nontumorigenic tissues). Differentiation through agents such as all-trans retinoic acid and osteogenic differentiation medium was induced to the chordoma cells. Additionally, U-CH1 cells were sorted via magnetic cell sorting for stem cell markers CD133 and CD15. After separation, positive and negative cells for these markers were grown in a nonadherent environment, soft agar, to determine whether the presence of these cancer stem-like cells might be responsible for initiating chordoma. The results were compared with those of untreated cells in terms of migration, proliferation, and gene expression by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.</str>
<str>The results indicate that chordoma cells might be differentiating and committing into an osteogenic lineage when induced with the osteogenic differentiation agent. Chordoma cells that are induced with retinoic acid showed slower migration and proliferation rates when compared with the untreated cells. Chordoma cells that were found to be enriched by cancer stem-like cell markers, namely CD133 and CD15, were able to live in a nonadherent soft agar medium, demonstrating a self-renewal capability. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that cancer stem-like cell markers were also found to be expressed in chordoma cells and tissues.</str>
<str>Cancer stem-like cell detection might be an important step in determining the recurrent and metastatic characteristics of chordoma. This finding may lead to the development of new approaches toward treatments of chordomas.</str>

<str>Chordomas are rare primary malignant bone tumours that derive from notochord precursor cells and express brachyury, a molecule involved in notochord development. Little is known about the genetic events responsible for driving the growth of this tumour, but it is well established that brachyury is regulated through fibroblastic growth factor receptors (FGFRs) through RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and ETS2 in ascidian, Xenopus and zebrafish, although little is known about its regulation in mammals. The aim of this study was to attempt to identify the molecular genetic events that are responsible for the pathogenesis of chordomas with particular focus on the FGFR signalling pathway on the basis of the evidence in the ascidian and Xenopus models that the expression of brachyury requires the activation of this pathway. Immunohistochemistry showed that 47 of 50 chordomas (94%) expressed at least one of the FGFRs, and western blotting showed phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 alpha (FRS2alpha), an adaptor signalling protein, that links FGFR to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Screening for mutations in brachyury (all coding exons and promoter), FGFRs 1-4 (previously reported mutations), KRAS (codons 12, 13, 51, 61) and BRAF (exons 11 and 15) failed to show any genetic alterations in 23 chordomas. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis on FGFR4, ETS2 and brachyury failed to show either amplification of these genes, although there was minor allelic gain in brachyury in three tumours, or translocation for ERG and ETS2 loci. The key genetic events responsible for the initiation and progression of chordomas remain to be discovered.</str>

<str>Chordomas are rare and slowly growing malignant bone tumors which mostly occur in adults. These bone tumors are characterized by epithelial and mesenchymal aspects. It is suggested that they arise from remnants of the notochord because they are found along the axial skeleton (e.g. clival, spinal and sacrococcygeal locations). It appears that cytogenetic aberrations are not randomly found in this tumor group. Loss of chromosomal material (e.g. 1p, 3p, 10q, 13q and 14q) is more frequently found than gain of material (e.g. 7q, especially 7q33). Several studies demonstrated brachyury expression (T; 6q27) as a possible candidate gene in the oncogenesis of chordomas (e.g. knock down in the chordoma cell line U-CH1). So far therapy consists of complete resection and irradiation, e.g. with carbon ions. Targeting therapy is not yet established in routine protocols but phase II studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown partial response of tumors and, in some studies stabilization of the disease has been described. </str>
