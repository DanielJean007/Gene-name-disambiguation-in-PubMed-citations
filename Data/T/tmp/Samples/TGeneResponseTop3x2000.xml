      <str>Although many studies supported the hypothesis that chordoma arise from NCRs, there has been little direct evidence reported to date. Of the base of our previous study, we conducted a comparative histological study among NCRs coexisting in chordoma, fetal NCRs, and chordoma tumor components.</str>
      <str>Thirty fetal nucleus pulposus and 46 chordoma specimens were harvested, and classic chordoma tumor markers and brachyury expression levels were investigated through immunohistochemical method.</str>
      <str>The fetal NCRs existed in the form of clusters in the center of nucleus pulposus &lt;36 gestational weeks; NCRs coexisting in chordoma specimens consisted of packed cells without extracellular myxoid matrix. Both the above-mentioned NCRs as well as chordoma tumor components showed high sensitivity for classic chordoma tumor makers (epithelial membrane antigen, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, vimentin, S-100); both kinds of NCRs showed completely negative expression for brachyury, whereas chordoma tumor components demonstrated 100% positivity.</str>

      <str>Increasing numbers of studies support the hypothesis that chordoma arises from notochordal cell rests, although the mechanism awaits further research. Brachyury is the first specific molecule linking chordoma with the notochord, and galectin-3 has been widely used as a marker of notochordal cells. We conducted a histological study of the expression of these two molecules in 46 classic chordoma specimens and unexpectedly found that classic chordoma tumor cells coexisted with benign notochordal cell rests in six specimens. Brachyury and galectin-3 expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. All specimens contained atypical chordoma tumor cells set within an abundant myxoid matrix, which strongly expressed brachyury and galectin-3. However, brachyury and galectin-3 were not expressed in the notochordal cells. Benign notochordal cells, present as notochord rests, could undergo malignant transformation to form chordoma; however, the cause and role of brachyury and galectin-3 expression in chordoma tumorigenesis requires further careful study.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumour of bone showing notochordal differentiation with characteristic expression of the transcription factor brachyury (T). Next to giving insight into its differentiation spectrum, the expression of T can be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool. The expression of brachyury in chordoma is necessary to maintain cell proliferation in chordoma cell lines, indicating that in chordoma it might be a master regulator of oncogenesis. Identification and mapping of the full gene regulatory network in a recent work in The Journal of Pathology by Nelson and colleagues not only shed light on involved pathways but also indicated pathways for targeted therapy, including brachyury itself.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a marker for notochord-derived tissues and neoplasms, such as chordoma. However, the prognostic relevance of brachyury expression in chordoma is still unknown. The improvement of tissue microarray technology has provided the opportunity to perform analyses of tumor tissues on a large scale in a uniform and consistent manner. This study was designed with the use of tissue microarray to determine the expression of brachyury. Brachyury expression in chordoma tissues from 78 chordoma patients was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray. The clinicopathologic parameters, including gender, age, location of tumor and metastatic status were evaluated. Fifty-nine of 78 (75.64%) tumors showed nuclear staining for brachyury, and among them, 29 tumors (49.15%) showed 1+ (&lt;30% positive cells) staining, 15 tumors (25.42%) had 2+ (31% to 60% positive cells) staining, and 15 tumors (25.42%) demonstrated 3+ (61% to 100% positive cells) staining. Brachyury nuclear staining was detected more frequently in sacral chordomas than in chordomas of the mobile spine. However, there was no significant relationship between brachyury expression and other clinical variables. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, brachyury expression failed to produce any significant relationship with the overall survival rate. In conclusion, brachyury expression is not a prognostic indicator in chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a malignant bone neoplasm hypothesized to arise from notochordal remnants along the length of the neuraxis. Recent genomic investigation of chordomas has identified T (Brachyury) gene duplication as a major susceptibility mutation in familial chordomas. Brachyury plays a vital role during embryonic development of the notochord and has recently been shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived cancers. However, current understanding of the role of this transcription factor in chordoma is limited due to the lack of availability of a fully characterized chordoma cell line expressing Brachyury. Thus, the objective of this study was to establish the first fully characterized primary chordoma cell line expressing gain of the T gene locus that readily recapitulates the original parental tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo.</str>
      <str>Using an intraoperatively obtained tumor sample from a 61-year-old woman with primary sacral chordoma, a chordoma cell line (JHC7, or Johns Hopkins Chordoma Line 7) was established. Molecular characterization of the primary tumor and cell line was conducted using standard immunostaining and Western blotting. Chromosomal aberrations and genomic amplification of the T gene in this cell line were determined. Using this cell line, a xenograft model was established and the histopathological analysis of the tumor was performed. Silencing of Brachyury and changes in gene expression were assessed.</str>
      <str>The authors report, for the first time, the successful establishment of a chordoma cell line (JHC7) from a patient with pathologically confirmed sacral chordoma. This cell line readily forms tumors in immunodeficient mice that recapitulate the parental tumor phenotype with conserved histological features consistent with the parental tumor. Furthermore, it is demonstrated for the first time that silencing of Brachyury using short hairpin RNA renders the morphology of chordoma cells to a more differentiated-like state and leads to complete growth arrest and senescence with an inability to be passaged serially in vitro.</str>
      <str>This report represents the first xenograft model of a sacral chordoma line described in the literature and the first cell line established with stable Brachyury expression. The authors propose that Brachyury is an attractive therapeutic target in chordoma and that JHC7 will serve as a clinically relevant model for the study of this disease.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a transcription factor which is required for posterior mesoderm formation and differentiation as well as for notochord development during embryogenesis. Due to its expression in the neoplastic cells of chordoma, a malignant tumour deriving from notochordal remnants, but not in tumors showing a similar histology, brachyury has been proposed as a diagnostic marker of this neoplasia. Though commonly considered a hallmark of chordoma, the expression of brachyury has been also documented in the stromal cells of hemangioblastoma (HBL), a slow growing tumor which may involve the central nervous system (CNS) and, rarely, the kidney. Herein we review the role of brachyury immunohistochemical detection in the identification and differential diagnosis of chordoma and HBL towards histological mimickers and suggest that brachyury is added to the panel of immunohistochemical markers for the recognition of HBL in routinary practice, principally in unusual sites. </str>

      <str>Recent evidence suggests that the expression of brachyury is necessary for chordoma growth. However, the mechanism associated with brachyury-regulated cell growth is poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a regulator of brachyury expression in normal tissue, may also play an important role in chordoma pathophysiology. Using a panel of chordoma cell lines, we explored the role of FGF signaling and brachyury in cell growth and survival. Western blots showed that all chordoma cell lines expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), FGFR3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), whereas no cell lines expressed FGFR1 and FGFR4. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that chordoma cells produced FGF2. Neutralization of FGF2 inhibited MEK/ERK phosphorylation, decreased brachyury expression and induced apoptosis while reducing cell growth. Activation of the FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway by FGF2-initiated phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2)-α (Tyr196) prevented apoptosis while promoting cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immunofluorescence staining showed that FGF2 promoted the translocation of phosphorylated ERK to the nucleus and increased brachyury expression. The selective inhibition of FGFR, MEK and ERK phosphorylation by PD173074, PD0325901 and PD184352, respectively, decreased brachyury expression, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth and EMT. Moreover, knockdown of brachyury by small hairpin RNA reduced FGF2 secretion, inhibited FGFR/MEK/ERK phosphorylation and blocked the effects of FGF2 on cell growth, apoptosis and EMT. Those findings highlight that FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway coordinately regulates chordoma cell growth and survival and may represent a novel chemotherapeutic target for chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumour of bone, the molecular marker of which is the expression of the transcription factor, brachyury. Having recently demonstrated that silencing brachyury induces growth arrest in a chordoma cell line, we now seek to identify its downstream target genes. Here we use an integrated functional genomics approach involving shRNA-mediated brachyury knockdown, gene expression microarray, ChIP-seq experiments, and bioinformatics analysis to achieve this goal. We confirm that the T-box binding motif of human brachyury is identical to that found in mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish development, and that brachyury acts primarily as an activator of transcription. Using human chordoma samples for validation purposes, we show that brachyury binds 99 direct targets and indirectly influences the expression of 64 other genes, thereby acting as a master regulator of an elaborate oncogenic transcriptional network encompassing diverse signalling pathways including components of the cell cycle, and extracellular matrix components. Given the wide repertoire of its active binding and the relative specific localization of brachyury to the tumour cells, we propose that an RNA interference-based gene therapy approach is a plausible therapeutic avenue worthy of investigation.</str>

      <str>A small number of tumors bearing histological resemblance to axial chordoma arising from the bone or soft tissue outside the axial skeleton have been reported. These lesions have historically been referred to as parachordoma, chordoma periphericum (CP), or extra-axial chordoma (EAC). With the introduction of the immunohistochemical stain brachyury, a sensitive and specific marker for notochordal origin, chordomas arising in extra-axial locations (i.e., CP, EAC), are now diagnosed with more accuracy and distinguished from parachordoma, which resembles chordoma on histology. The distinction between EAC and parachordoma is clinically important because EAC confirmed by immunoreactivity for brachyury tends to grow and recur with local bone destruction. Prior to the introduction of brachyury, the diagnosis of EAC was challenging and therefore the imaging features of EAC have not been comprehensively described. We report two cases of recurrent EAC confirmed by the expression of brachyury arising from the distal femur and distal tibia and describe the imaging findings from radiography and MRI at initial diagnosis and at recurrence. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, but often malignant, bone cancer that preferentially affects the axial skeleton and the skull base. These tumors are both sporadic and hereditary and appear to occur more frequently after the fourth decade of life; however, modern technologies have increased the detection of pediatric chordomas. Chordomas originate from remnants of the notochord, the main embryonic axial structure that precedes the backbone, and share with notochord cells both histological features and the expression of characteristic genes. One such gene is Brachyury, which encodes for a sequence-specific transcription factor. Known for decades as a main regulator of notochord formation, Brachyury has recently gained interest as a biomarker and causative agent of chordoma, and therefore as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we review the main characteristics of chordoma, the molecular markers, and the clinical approaches currently available for the early detection and possible treatment of this cancer. In particular, we report on the current knowledge of the role of Brachyury and of its possible mechanisms of action in both notochord formation and chordoma etiogenesis.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is recognized as a specific marker for notochord-derived tissues and neoplasms, and has become a defining immunohistochemical feature of chordoma. The main differential diagnostic consideration for chordoma is chondrosarcoma, which is known to lack brachyury expression. However, within the spectrum of genitourinary neoplasia, metastatic germ cell tumors and clear cell renal cell carcinoma may also be close morphological mimics of chordoma, particularly given the increasing prevalence of small tissue samples from image-guided biopsies. Although immunoreactivity for brachyury has been reported in a few germ cell tumors, a thorough characterization of staining by specific subtype has not been performed in a large series. Additionally, brachyury expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma has not been well studied. In this study, immunohistochemical expression with the brachyury antibody was evaluated in 111 germ cell tumors, 30 non-neoplastic and neoplastic (non-germ cell) testicular tissues, and 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas using tissue microarray technology. In addition, immunoreactivity for PAX-8 and SALL-4 was evaluated in 12 chordomas on whole section. No nuclear brachyury expression was identified in any of the 101 germ cell tumors within the tissue microarray (including choriocarcinoma (1), embryonal carcinoma (20), intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (2), seminoma (64), spermatocytic seminoma (1), teratoma (5) and yolk sac tumor (8)), in any of the 30 non-neoplastic and neoplastic (non-germ cell) testicular tissues, or in any of the 10 whole-section seminomas. All 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas were also non-reactive for brachyury. All 12 chordomas showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity for brachyury, but no expression of SALL-4. In all, 1 of 12 chordoma cases showed patchy, 1+ nuclear immunoreactivity for PAX-8. This study confirms the specificity of brachyury for chordoma in the differential diagnostic distinction from the potential genitourinary mimics, germ cell tumors and metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are invasive tumors that develop from notochordal remnants and frequently occur in the skull base. The T gene and its product (brachyury) have recently been suggested to play an important role in chordoma progression. To date, few studies have investigated the relationship between the molecular/genetic characteristics of chordoma and patient prognosis. We analyzed 37 skull base chordomas for chromosomal copy number aberrations using comparative genomic hybridization, brachyury expression by immunohistochemistry, and T gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results of these molecular analyses and clinical parameters were compared with the patients' clinical courses. Univariate analyses using the log-rank test demonstrated that losses on chromosome 1p and gains on 1q and 2p were negatively correlated with progression-free survival, as were factors such as female sex, partial tumor removal, lack of postoperative irradiation, and high MIB-1 index. Expression of brachyury and copy number gain of the T gene were also significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox hazards model showed that lack of irradiation, gain on chromosome 2p, and expression of brachyury were independently associated with a poor prognosis. Our results suggest that brachyury-negative chordomas arebiologically distinct from brachyury-positive chordomas and that T/brachyury might be an appropriate molecular therapeutic target for chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumours considered to arise from notochordal remnants that persist in the axial skeleton. Although their morphology can resemble that of a carcinoma, chondrosarcoma or malignant melanoma, the axial location and their well-defined immunophenotype, including expression of cytokeratins (CK7/20/8/18/19) and S100, generally allow the diagnosis to be made with confidence once the possibility is considered. In contrast, making a robust diagnosis of an extra-axial chordoma has been difficult in the absence of specific markers for chordomas. We have recently shown in gene expression microarray and immunohistochemistry studies that brachyury, a transcription factor crucial for notochordal development, is a specific and sensitive maker for chordomas. We now present a case of an intracortical tibial tumour, with detailed report of the imaging, and morphological features consistent with a chordoma, where notochordal differentiation was demonstrated with an antibody to brachyury. The tumour cells were also positive for cytokeratins, including CK19, and S100, CEA, EMA and HMBE1, findings which support the diagnosis of chordoma. Brachyury can be employed as a marker of notochordal differentiation and help identify confidently, for the first time, extra-axial bone and soft tissue chordomas, and tumours which may show focal notochordal differentiation.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a transcription factor of the T-box family typically expressed in notochord and chordoma. Some studies report brachyury as highly specific for chordoma, whereas others have concluded that brachyury is expressed in many types of common carcinomas by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and could be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic process. In this study, we immunohistochemically evaluated 5229 different tumors for nuclear brachyury expression using a new rabbit monoclonal antibody and automated immunostaining (Leica Bond Max). Only nuclear labeling was scored, and antibody dilution of 1:2000 was used. In normal tissues, only rare cells in seminiferous tubules were labeled; all other organs were negative. All chordomas (75/76), except a sarcomatous one, were positive, whereas chondrosarcomas were negative. Among epithelial tumors, positivity was often detected in embryonal carcinoma (74%) and seminoma (45%). Pulmonary small cell carcinoma was often positive (41%), whereas pulmonary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas only rarely showed nuclear brachyury positivity (3% to 4%). Common carcinomas such as ductal carcinomas of the breast or adenocarcinomas of the prostate only exceptionally showed nuclear positivity (&lt;1%). No colorectal, hepatocellular, renal cell, squamous cell, thyroid or urothelial carcinoma, or mesothelioma showed nuclear brachyury positivity. Among mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors, only isolated cases of melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and follicular lymphoma showed nuclear expression. However, as shown previously with lung carcinoma, experiments with lower antibody dilutions (1:200 to 1:500) showed weak cytoplasmic and nuclear labeling in breast cancers. In addition to chordoma, we show here for the first time that nuclear brachyury expression is prevalent in embryonal carcinoma, seminoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lung but very rare in common carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanoma. With these reservations, we have demonstrated the presence of nuclear brachyury immunoreactivity to be a sensitive and fairly specific marker for chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordoma, and its relationship to the notochord, has intrigued many researchers over the last two centuries. In particular, the morphological overlap with cartilaginous tumours is striking, and developmental biology has shown a tight relationship between cartilage and the notochord. This is reflected in the expression of common genes in chordoid and chondroid tumours. Wide gene expression analyses have led to the identification of key molecules that might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chordoma. Brachyury, a key factor in notochord fate, is significantly differentially expressed in chordoma. This not only gives insight into the histogenesis of this tumour but may also point towards new diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis between chordoid and chondroid tumours.</str>

In this study, therefore, we compared the transcriptional expression profile of one sacral chordoma recurrence, two chordoma cell lines (U-CH1 and U-CH2) and one chondrosarcoma cell line (U-CS2) with vertebral disc using a high-density oligonucleotide array. The expression of 65 genes whose mRNA levels differed significantly (p&lt;0.001; ≥6-fold change) between chordoma and control (vertebral disc) was identified. Genes with increased expression in chordoma compared to control and chondrosarcoma were most frequently located on chromosomes 2 (11%), 5 (8%), 1 and 7 (each 6%), whereas interphase cytogenetics of 33 chordomas demonstrated gains of chromosomal material most prevalent on 7q (42%), 12q (21%), 17q (21%), 20q (27%) and 22q (21%). The microarray data were confirmed for selected genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. As in other studies, we showed the expression of brachyury. We demonstrate the expression of new potential candidates for chordoma tumorigenesis, such as CD24, ECRG4, RARRES2, IGFBP2, RAP1, HAI2, RAB38, osteopontin, GalNAc-T3, VAMP8 and others.

      <str>Axial chordoma represents approximately 1% of malignant bone tumors. This tumor expresses cytokeratins, specifically cytokeratin 19, and commonly S100. More recently brachyury, a transcription factor important in mesodermal differentiation, including notochord development, has been detected by immunohistochemistry in axial chordomas and hemangioblastomas but not chondrosarcomas or other neoplasms. In this report, we describe 10 cases (6 men, 4 women: age 18 to 68 y; mean 44.6) of extra-axial tumors, 8 in bone and 2 in soft tissue, with morphologic and immunohistochemical features identical to those of axial chordoma. Imaging excluded metastases from axial chordoma. Three tumors occurred in the tibia, the others in the rib, metatarsal, ulna, femur, pubis: 2 intracortical, 6 intramedullary. Both soft tissue brachyury-positive tumors, one involving the thumb the other the wrist, were sited in the juxta-articular region. Seven of the tumors were widely excised and these patients are disease-free but of the 3 tumors that recurred, 1 was curetted, 1 was marginally excised, and 1 had a pathologic fracture on presentation. Metastases have not occurred in any of the patients. We also confirm the expression of brachyury in hemangioblastomas, and for the first time demonstrates its expression in spermatogonia and testicular germ cell tumors by immunohistochemistry. Brachyury was not detected in a wide range of tumors including carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas. In conclusion, we describe the first series of extra-axial skeletal chordomas bringing the total number of such cases reported in the literature to 11, and present the first report of 2 soft tissue chordomas as defined by brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>Chordoma cells can generate solid-like tumors in xenograft models that express some molecular characteristics of the parent tumor, including positivity for brachyury and cytokeratins. However, there is a dearth of molecular markers that relate to chordoma tumor growth, as well as the cell lines needed to advance treatment. The objective in this study was to isolate a novel primary chordoma cell source and analyze the characteristics of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model for comparison with the established U-CH1 and U-CH2b cell lines.</str>
      <str>Primary cells from a sacral chordoma, called "DVC-4," were cultured alongside U-CH1 and U-CH2b cells for more than 20 passages and characterized for expression of CD24 and brachyury. While brachyury is believed essential for driving tumor formation, CD24 is associated with healthy nucleus pulposus cells. Each cell type was subcutaneously implanted in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ(null) mice. The percentage of solid tumors formed, time to maximum tumor size, and immunostaining scores for CD24 and brachyury (intensity scores of 0-3, heterogeneity scores of 0-1) were reported and evaluated to test differences across groups.</str>
      <str>The DVC-4 cells retained chordoma-like morphology in culture and exhibited CD24 and brachyury expression profiles in vitro that were similar to those for U-CH1 and U-CH2b. Both U-CH1 and DVC-4 cells grew tumors at rates that were faster than those for U-CH2b cells. Gross tumor developed at nearly every site (95%) injected with U-CH1 and at most sites (75%) injected with DVC-4. In contrast, U-CH2b cells produced grossly visible tumors in less than 50% of injected sites. Brachyury staining was similar among tumors derived from all 3 cell types and was intensely positive (scores of 2-3) in a majority of tissue sections. In contrast, differences in the pattern and intensity of staining for CD24 were noted among the 3 types of cell-derived tumors (p &lt; 0.05, chi-square test), with evidence of intense and uniform staining in a majority of U-CH1 tumor sections (score of 3) and more than half of the DVC-4 tumor sections (scores of 2-3). In contrast, a majority of sections from U-CH2b cells stained modestly for CD24 (scores of 1-2) with a predominantly heterogeneous staining pattern.</str>
      <str>This is the first report on xenografts generated from U-CH2b cells in which a low tumorigenicity was discovered despite evidence of chordoma-like characteristics in vitro. For tumors derived from a primary chordoma cell and U-CH1 cell line, similarly intense staining for CD24 was observed, which may correspond to their similar potential to grow tumors. In contrast, U-CH2b tumors stained less intensely for CD24. These results emphasize that many markers, including CD24, may be useful in distinguishing among chordoma cell types and their tumorigenicity in vivo.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are malignant tumours that occur along the spine and are thought to derive from notochordal remnants. There is significant morphological variability between and within chordomas, with some showing prominent areas of chondroid differentiation. Our microarray data from a broad range of connective tissue neoplasms indicate that, at the transcriptional level, chordomas resemble cartilaginous neoplasms. Here we show that chordomas express many genes known to be involved in cartilage development, but they also uniquely express genes distinguishing them from chondroid neoplasms. The brachyury transcription factor, known to be involved in notochordal development, is only expressed by chordomas. Using a polyclonal antibody, we show that brachyury is expressed in the embryonic notochord and in all 53 chordomas analysed, labelling both chondroid and chordoid areas of these tumours. In contrast, the protein was not detected in over 300 neoplasms, including 163 chondroid tumours. Brachyury was not detected in the nucleus pulposus, arguing against the hypothesis that this tissue derives directly from the notochord. These data provide compelling evidence that chordomas derive from notochord and demonstrate that brachyury is a specific marker for the notochord and notochord-derived tumours.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are midline tumors that arise from embryonic remnants of the notochord and are considered to be malignant tumors because of their tendency to invade and destroy the involved bone. Cases of intradural chordomas without bone involvement have been rarely described with a predilection for prepontine location. The absence of bony invasion renders the complete excision of these tumors more feasible and is related to their better prognosis in comparison to conventional chordomas. Herein we report the first intradural chordoma arising in the Meckel's cave. The intradural location of the lesion, outside midline structures, in the absence of bone infiltration, made the differential diagnosis versus other meningeal lesions such as chordoid meningioma challenging. The intense and strong immunohistochemical expression of pan-cytokeratins, S100, cytokeratin-19 and of the notochordal marker brachyury allowed differential diagnosis toward other tumors showing chordoid morphology. The expression of brachyury, which had not been previously analyzed in intradural chordoma, definitely links the histogenesis of this neoplasia to the notochord, similar to that of conventional chordoma. We also show that, different from conventional chordoma, intradural chordoma does not express the metallo-proteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9, which may account for its indolent biological behavior.</str>

      <str>To investigate the clinical and pathologic characteristics of primary intradural retroclival chordoma and improve the understanding of this rare disease.</str>
      <str>A retrospective study was conducted on six cases patients withof an intradural chordoma in the retroclival region who underwent surgery and were confirmed by pathology and imaging. Expression of brachyury, galectin-3, and Ki-67 in paraffin-embedded sections of the specimens was detected by streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry.</str>
      <str>Lesions were located in the subdural prepontine cistern. Computed tomography scan showed that the bone of the skull base was not destroyed, and findings on magnetic resonance imaging varied, resulting in a misdiagnosis of 50% of the cases in the preoperative imaging. All six cases were classified by their pathology into the classical subtype. They presented a strong positive staining for brachyury and galectin-3, and the Ki-67 labeling index was between 2.5% and 8.2%. Three cases presented no signs of recurrence or regrowth, whereas in the other three patients recurrence or regrowth occurred at 7 ∼ 14 months after initial surgery. Two patients died of this disease.</str>
      <str>Our study suggests that a positive staining for brachyury, galectin-3, and Ki-67 would be helpful for differential diagnosis, discriminating intradural retroclival chordoma from ecchordosis physaliphora and chordoid meningioma. Our study also shows that within intradural retroclival chordoma, there are significant prognostic differences. Tumors with an abundant blood supply, flake-like cellular arrangement, and a Ki-67 labeling index greater than 5% belong to a rapid-growth type and are prone to short-term recurrence and poorer prognosis.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordomas are challenging tumors due to their deep surgical location and resistance to conventional radiotherapy. Chemotherapy plays a marginal role in the treatment of chordoma resulting from lack of preclinical models due to the difficulty in establishing tumor cell lines and valuable in vivo models. Here, we established a cell line from a recurrent clival chordoma. Cells were cultured for more than 30 passages and the expression of the chordoma cell marker brachyury was monitored using both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Sensitivity of chordoma cells to the inhibition of specific signaling pathways was assessed through testing of a commercially available small molecule kinase inhibitor library. In vivo tumorigenicity was evaluated by grafting chordoma cells onto immunocompromised mice and established tumor xenografts were treated with rapamycin. Rapamycin was administered to the donor patient and its efficacy was assessed on follow-up neuroimaging. Chordoma cells maintained brachyury expression at late passages and generated xenografts closely mimicking the histology and phenotype of the parental tumor. Rapamycin was identified as an inhibitor of chordoma cell proliferation. Molecular analyses on tumor cells showed activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and mutation of KRAS gene. Rapamycin was also effective in reducing the growth of chordoma xenografts. On the basis of these results, our patient received rapamycin therapy with about six-fold reduction of the tumor growth rate upon 10-month follow-up neuroimaging. This is the first case of chordoma in whom chemotherapy was tailored on the basis of the sensitivity of patient-derived tumor cells. </str>

      <str>The distinction between chondrosarcoma and chordoma of the skull base/head and neck is prognostically important; however, both have sufficient morphologic overlap to make delineation difficult. As a result of gene expression studies, additional candidate markers have been proposed to help in separating those entities. We sought to evaluate the performance of new markers: brachyury, SOX-9, and podoplanin alongside the more traditional markers glial fibrillary acid protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CD24, and epithelial membrane antigen. Paraffin blocks from 103 skull base/head and neck chondroid tumors from 70 patients were retrieved (1969-2007). Diagnoses were made based on morphology and/or whole-section immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and S100 protein yielding 79 chordomas (comprising 45 chondroid chordomas and 34 conventional chordomas), and 24 chondrosarcomas. A tissue microarray containing 0.6 mm cores of each tumor in triplicate was constructed using a manual array (MTA-1; Beecher Instruments). For visualization of staining, the ImmPRESS detection system (Vector Laboratories) with 2-diaminobenzidine substrate was used. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each marker. Core loss from the microarray ranged from 25 to 29% yielding 66-78 viable cases per stain. The classic marker, cytokeratin, still has the best performance characteristics. When combined with brachyury, accuracy improves slightly (sensitivity and specificity for detection of chordoma 98 and 100%, respectively). Positivity for both epithelial membrane antigen and AE1/AE3 had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100% for detecting chordoma in this study. SOX-9 is apparently common to both notochordal and cartilaginous differentiation, and is not useful in the chordoma-chondrosarcoma differential diagnosis. Glial fibrillary acid protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CD24, and epithelial membrane antigen did not outperform other markers, and are less useful in the diagnosis of chordoma vs chondrosarcoma. Podoplanin still remains the only positive marker for chondrosarcoma, though its accuracy is less than previously reported.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a neoplasm of notochordal differentiation that typically occurs in the axial skeleton. Accurate diagnosis is therapeutically important but can be challenging, especially in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy (CNB). Immunohistochemistry for the transcription factor brachyury (T) has recently proven diagnostically useful in whole-tissue sections. Our aim was to compare brachyury performance with conventional markers (S-100, EMA, keratin) and to evaluate its utility in distinguishing chordoma from cytomorphologic mimics. Brachyury immunohistochemistry was performed on chordoma (8 FNA, 12 CNB), chondrosarcoma (10 FNA), and metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (12 FNA). Immunohistochemistry performed at the time of diagnosis was also reviewed. Brachyury was positive in 17 (85%) cases of chordoma and typically showed moderate-to-strong nuclear staining. Of five sets of concurrent FNA and CNB, four pairs were positive for brachyury in both samples and one pair was positive for brachyury in the CNB and negative in the cell block. S-100, EMA, and keratin stains were available for 13 chordomas: 9 (69%) cases (including the 3 negative for brachyury) were positive for S-100 and keratin or EMA; 4 cases were keratin positive but S-100 negative. No nuclear brachyury staining was seen in chondrosarcoma or adenocarcinoma, though two adenocarcinomas showed cytoplasmic staining. Brachyury separates chordoma from cytomorphologic mimics with high sensitivity and specificity in small biopsies. As a single test, brachyury has higher sensitivity than a combined panel of S-100 and epithelial markers. When added to the conventional panel, brachyury increases sensitivity to 100% without sacrificing specificity.</str>

      <str>A recent chordoma cancer genotyping study reveals that the rs2305089, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in brachyury gene and a key gene in the development of notochord, is significantly associated with chordoma risk. The brachyury gene is believed to be one of the key genes involved in the pathogenesis of chordoma, a rare primary bone tumor originating along the spinal column or at the base of the skull. The association between the brachyury Gly177Asp single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the risk of skull base chordoma in Chinese populations is currently unknown. We investigated the genotype distribution of this SNP in 65 skull-base chordoma cases and 120 healthy subjects. Comparisons of the genotype distributions and allele frequencies did not reveal any significant difference between the groups.

      <str>Chordomas are rare primary bone tumors that occur along the neuraxis. Primary treatment is surgery, often followed by radiotherapy. Treatment options for patients with recurrence are limited and, notably, there are no FDA approved therapeutic agents. Development of therapeutic options has been limited by the paucity of preclinical model systems. We have established and previously reported the initial characterization of the first patient-derived chordoma xenograft model. In this study, we further characterize this model and demonstrate that it continues to resemble the original patient tumor histologically and immunohistochemically, maintains nuclear expression of brachyury, and is highly concordant with the original patient tumor by whole genome genotyping. Pathway analysis of this xenograft demonstrates activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In vitro studies demonstrate that two small molecule inhibitors of EGFR, erlotinib and gefitinib, inhibit proliferation of the chordoma cell line U-CH 1. We further demonstrate that erlotinib significantly inhibits chordoma growth in vivo. Evaluation of tumors post-treatment reveals that erlotinib reduces phosphorylation of EGFR. This is the first demonstration of antitumor activity in a patient-derived chordoma xenograft model and these findings support further evaluation of EGFR inhibitors in this disease. </str>

      <str>Cytomorphology on the tumor showed nests of round cells with vacuoles and also physaliferous-like cells with uniform nuclei. Immunochemistry revealed a tumor positive for vimentin, moderately positive for S-100 and cytokeratin AE1/AE3, weakly positive for epithelial membrane antigen, and negative for p63 and cytokeratin (CK)-7. Further analysis revealed the tumor was diffusely and strongly positive for brachyury. The cell line derived from the tumor showed rapid doubling-time, a strong expression of mesenchymal cell surface markers, a karyotype of diploid or hypotetraploid clones with numerous chromosomal aberrations, and the ability to form colonies without attachment and to form tumors in immunocompromised mice.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are malignant neoplasms that typically arise in the axial spine and primarily affect adults. When chordomas arise in pediatric patients they are more likely to display unusual histological features and aggressive behavior. We noted the absence of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by immunohistochemistry in an index case of poorly differentiated chordoma of the sacrum, leading us to further examine SMARCB1/INI1 expression as well as that of brachyury, a highly specific marker of notochordal differentiation, in 3 additional poorly differentiated chordomas of the clivus, 10 typical chordomas, and 8 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs). All 4 poorly differentiated chordomas and all AT/RTs lacked nuclear expression of SMARCB1/INI1, while the 10 typical chordomas maintained strong nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 immunoreactivity. All 10 typical and 4 poorly differentiated chordomas expressed brachyury; all 8 AT/RTs were brachyury immunonegative. Cytogenetic evaluation utilizing FISH probes near the SMARCB1/INI1 locus on chromosome 22q was also performed in all of the poorly differentiated chordomas in this series. Three of the four poorly differentiated chordomas had evidence for deletion of this region by FISH. Analysis of the SMARCB1/INI1 gene sequence was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in all cases and no point mutations were observed. In summary, all poorly differentiated chordomas in this series showed the absence of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, and were reliably distinguished from AT/RTs, clinically by their characteristic primary sites of origin and pathologically by strong nuclear brachyury expression. Our findings reveal a likely role for SMARCB1/INI1 in a subset of chordomas with aggressive features.</str>

Understanding copy number alterations in chordoma may reveal critical disease mechanisms that could be exploited for tumor classification and therapy. We report the copy number analysis of 21 sporadic chordomas using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Recurrent copy changes were further evaluated with immunohistochemistry, methylation specific PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR. Similar to previous findings, large copy number losses, involving chromosomes 1p, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 18, were more common than copy number gains. Loss of CDKN2A with or without loss of CDKN2B on 9p21.3 was observed in 16/20 (80%) unique cases of which six (30%) showed homozygous deletions ranging from 76 kilobases to 4.7 megabases. One copy loss of the 10q23.31 region which encodes PTEN was found in 16/20 (80%) cases. Loss of CDKN2A and PTEN expression in the majority of cases was not attributed to promoter methylation. Our sporadic chordoma cases did not show hotspot point mutations in some common cancer gene targets. Moreover, most of these sporadic tumors are not associated with T (brachyury) duplication or amplification. Deficiency of CDKN2A and PTEN expression, although shared across many other different types of tumors, likely represents a key aspect of chordoma pathogenesis. Sporadic chordomas may rely on mechanisms other than copy number gain if they indeed exploit T/brachyury for proliferation.</str>

Knockdown of T in the cell line, U-CH1, which showed polysomy of chromosome 6 involving 6q27, resulted in a marked decrease in cell proliferation and morphological features consistent with a senescence-like phenotype. The U-CH1 cell line was validated as representing chordoma by the generation of xenografts, which showed typical chordoma morphology and immunohistochemistry in the NOD/SCID/interleukin 2 receptor [IL2r]gammanull mouse model.

Since then, SMARCB1 alterations have been found in other tumors, forming a varied group of SMARCB1-deficient tumors, which sometimes shares overlapping immunohistochemical and histological findings. Thus, the diagnosis is challenging. We report two cases of pediatric SMARCB1-deficient tumors from the clivus that illustrate the diagnostic difficulties. Both cases were strongly positive for epithelial markers associated with loss of BAF47 (INI1) expression, and were negative for S100 and CD34. Molecular analyses of the SMARCB1 gene found a deletion of all nine exons in both cases. In the first case, a 5-year-old girl presented with a thoracic metastasis of a clival tumor, which was diagnosed as MRT and treated accordingly. The morphological findings and the expression of brachyury would favor the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated chordoma. The second case was a quickly fatal clival tumor in a 2-year-old boy: This tumor was morphologically undifferentiated and raises the problem of differential diagnosis between an MRT, a malignant myoepithelial tumor, or an undifferentiated chordoma due to the location and the expression of brachyury. Studies of biological signatures, such as transcriptome profiling, could help to understand the apparent overlap between these tumors. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are locally aggressive bone tumors known to arise from the remnants of the notochord. Because chordomas are rare, molecular studies aimed at developing new therapies are scarce and new approaches are needed.

Therefore, it seems possible that chordomas might contain a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells.

Differentiation through agents such as all-trans retinoic acid and osteogenic differentiation medium was induced to the chordoma cells. Additionally, U-CH1 cells were sorted via magnetic cell sorting for stem cell markers CD133 and CD15. After separation, positive and negative cells for these markers were grown in a nonadherent environment, soft agar, to determine whether the presence of these cancer stem-like cells might be responsible for initiating chordoma. The results were compared with those of untreated cells in terms of migration, proliferation, and gene expression by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.</str>
      <str>The results indicate that chordoma cells might be differentiating and committing into an osteogenic lineage when induced with the osteogenic differentiation agent. Chordoma cells that are induced with retinoic acid showed slower migration and proliferation rates when compared with the untreated cells. Chordoma cells that were found to be enriched by cancer stem-like cell markers, namely CD133 and CD15, were able to live in a nonadherent soft agar medium, demonstrating a self-renewal capability.

      <str>Chordomas are rare primary malignant bone tumours that derive from notochord precursor cells and express brachyury, a molecule involved in notochord development. Little is known about the genetic events responsible for driving the growth of this tumour, but it is well established that brachyury is regulated through fibroblastic growth factor receptors (FGFRs) through RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and ETS2 in ascidian, Xenopus and zebrafish, although little is known about its regulation in mammals. The aim of this study was to attempt to identify the molecular genetic events that are responsible for the pathogenesis of chordomas with particular focus on the FGFR signalling pathway on the basis of the evidence in the ascidian and Xenopus models that the expression of brachyury requires the activation of this pathway. Immunohistochemistry showed that 47 of 50 chordomas (94%) expressed at least one of the FGFRs, and western blotting showed phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 alpha (FRS2alpha), an adaptor signalling protein, that links FGFR to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Screening for mutations in brachyury (all coding exons and promoter), FGFRs 1-4 (previously reported mutations), KRAS (codons 12, 13, 51, 61) and BRAF (exons 11 and 15) failed to show any genetic alterations in 23 chordomas. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis on FGFR4, ETS2 and brachyury failed to show either amplification of these genes, although there was minor allelic gain in brachyury in three tumours, or translocation for ERG and ETS2 loci. The key genetic events responsible for the initiation and progression of chordomas remain to be discovered.</str>

      <str>Chordomas of the tip of the tail in 6 ferrets were examined using histopathological, histochemical and immunohistochemical procedures. Histopathologically, round neoplastic cells containing numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles of varying sizes, categorized as "physaliphorous cells", were observed in the amorphous eosinophilic or pale basophilic myxoid stroma. Physaliphorous cells were arranged in lobules and in a "chordoid" or "cobblestone" manner. The neoplasms were diagnosed as benign chordoma without local invasion and metastasis. Histochemically, the cytoplasm of small neoplastic cells was positive for periodic acid-Schiff stain and alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5 and pH 1.0 stains, but negative for hyaluronidase digestion-AB pH 2.5 stain. All neoplastic cells were strongly stained with colloidal ion, negative for high iron diamine AB pH 2.5 and toluidine blue pH 2.5 stains, and positive for Mayer's mucicarmine stain. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against low-molecular-weight cytokeratins (CK18, CK19 and CK20), vimentin and mucin core protein (MUC5AC) revealed that neoplastic cells had both epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The expression of low-molecular-weight cytokeratins suggests that neoplastic cells acquired the properties of glandular epithelial cells and produced epithelial mucus. Furthermore, the expression of cytokeratins, vimentin, S100 protein, brachyury and epithelial membrane antigen indicates that the neoplasms were equivalent to the classic type of human chordoma. Therefore, immunohistochemistry using these antibodies can be useful for the characterization of ferret chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare and slowly growing malignant bone tumors which mostly occur in adults. These bone tumors are characterized by epithelial and mesenchymal aspects. It is suggested that they arise from remnants of the notochord because they are found along the axial skeleton (e.g. clival, spinal and sacrococcygeal locations). It appears that cytogenetic aberrations are not randomly found in this tumor group. Loss of chromosomal material (e.g. 1p, 3p, 10q, 13q and 14q) is more frequently found than gain of material (e.g. 7q, especially 7q33). Several studies demonstrated brachyury expression (T; 6q27) as a possible candidate gene in the oncogenesis of chordomas (e.g. knock down in the chordoma cell line U-CH1). So far therapy consists of complete resection and irradiation, e.g. with carbon ions. Targeting therapy is not yet established in routine protocols but phase II studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown partial response of tumors and, in some studies stabilization of the disease has been described. </str>

      <str>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is emerging as a critical factor for the progression and metastasis of carcinomas, as well as drug resistance. The T-box transcription factor Brachyury has been recently characterized as a driver of EMT in human carcinoma cells. The purpose of this study was to characterize Brachyury as a potential target for lung cancer therapy.</str>
      <str>The expression of Brachyury was evaluated by PCR and by immunohistochemistry in human lung tumors and adult normal tissues. Brachyury gene copy number and promoter methylation status were analyzed in tumor tissues with various levels of Brachyury expression. Lung carcinoma cells' susceptibility to T-cell lysis and EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibition were also evaluated relative to the levels of Brachyury.</str>
      <str>Our results showed Brachyury protein expression in 41% of primary lung carcinomas, including 48% of adenocarcinomas and 25% of squamous cell carcinomas. With the exception of normal testis and some thyroid tissues, the majority of normal tissues evaluated in this study were negative for the expression of Brachyury protein. Brachyury-specific T cells could lyse Brachyury-positive tumors and the level of Brachyury corresponded to resistance of tumor cells to EGFR kinase inhibition.</str>
      <str>We hypothesize that the elimination of Brachyury-positive tumor cells may be able to prevent and/or diminish tumor dissemination and the establishment of metastases. The ability of Brachyury-specific T-cell lines to lyse Brachyury-positive tumor cells, in vitro, supports the development of Brachyury-based immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of lung cancer.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, locally invasive tumors with characteristic expression of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury. Little is yet known of the molecular events involved in the development of these tumors. Bone morphogenesis protein 4 (BMP4) signaling, which acts upstream of Brachyury in embryonic development, has been implicated in carcinogenesis in multiple malignancies. To explore the role of the canonical BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of chordoma, we investigated, in 40 skull base chordomas, the expression of three major components of the signaling axis: BMP4, phospho-SMAD5 and SMAD4. Immunostaining revealed positive expression in 70%, 52.5% and 90% of cases, respectively. Eighteen (45%) of patients exhibited concurrent positive expression of these markers, which we defined as "high" expression of the BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway. Interestingly, when we compared the pattern of expression with clinicopathological parameters, we found that high expression of the pathway was more often observed in larger tumors (≥ 4 cm) than smaller ones (P = 0.010), and correlated significantly with dural invasion (P = 0.024). The Kaplan-Meier log-rank test showed that the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with high expression of the pathway was significantly lower than those with low expression (71.4% vs. 90.2%, P = 0.010). In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that overexpression of the BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway could predict poor clinical outcome in skull base chordomas, suggesting activation of this pathway is involved in chordoma pathogenesis. </str>

      <str>Chordoma, the molecular hallmark of which is T (brachyury), is a rare malignant bone tumour with a high risk of local recurrence and a tumour from which metastatic disease is a common late event. Currently, there is no effective drug therapy for treating chordomas, although there is evidence that some patients respond to the empirical use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonists. The aim of this study was to determine the role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of chordoma. Paraffin-embedded material from 173 chordomas from 160 patients [sacro-coccygeal (n = 94), skull-based (n = 50), and mobile spine (n = 16)] was analysed by immunohistochemistry and revealed total EGFR expression in 69% of cases analysed. Of 147 informative chordomas analysed by FISH, 38% revealed high-level EGFR polysomy, 4% high-level polysomy with focal amplification, 18% low-level polysomy, and 39% disomy. Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array membranes showed EGFR activation in the chordoma cell line U-CH1 and all of the three chordomas analysed. Direct sequencing of EGFR (exons 18-21), KRAS, NRAS, HRAS (exons 2, 3), and BRAF (exons 11, 15) using DNA from 62 chordomas failed to reveal mutations. PTEN expression was absent by immunohistochemistry in 19 of 147 (13%) analysed chordomas, only one of which revealed high-level polysomy of EGFR. The EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin (AG 1478) markedly inhibited proliferation of the chordoma cell line U-CH1 in vitro and diminished EGFR phosphorylation in a dose-dependant manner, a finding supported by inhibition of phosphorylated Erk1/2. p-Akt was suppressed to a much lesser degree in these experiments. There was no reduction of T as assessed by western blotting. These data implicate aberrant EGFR signalling in the pathogenesis of chordoma. This study provides a strategy for patient stratification for treatment with EGFR antagonists.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are slow-growing tumors and most commonly involve the sacrum and clivus. Multiple recurrences are frequent. Childhood chordomas are rare and often show exceptionally aggressive behavior, resulting in short survival and a high incidence of metastatic spread.</str>
      <str>This study examined the histologic features and immunohistochemical profile of pediatric chordomas and compared them with their adult counterparts.</str>
      <str>Nine pediatric and 13 adult cases were included in the study. Childhood chordomas were classified into conventional, atypical, and poorly differentiated types. Immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, S100, brachyury, p53, INI1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and CD117. Cytogenetic analyses were performed in a subset of tumors for SMARCB1/INI1 locus on 22q chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and analysis of the SMARCB1/INI1 gene sequence.</str>
      <str>All tumors showed expression of cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S100, vimentin, brachyury, and EGFR. Atypical morphology, p53 expression, higher MIB-1 labelling index (LI), and INI1 loss were more frequently seen in pediatric chordomas as compared with adults. None of the tumors showed CD117 expression. No point mutation in the SMARCB1/INI1 gene was noted in the tumors examined; however, 4 pediatric and 1 adult chordoma showed loss of this locus on FISH analysis.</str>
      <str>A subset of pediatric chordomas with atypical histomorphologic features needs to be identified, as they behave in an aggressive manner and require adjuvant therapy.

      <str>Chordoma and chondrosarcoma are malignant bone tumors characterized by the abundant production of extracellular matrix. The resistance of these tumors to conventional therapeutic modalities has prompted us to delineate the gene expression profile of these two tumor types, with the expectation to identify potential molecular therapeutic targets. Furthermore the transcriptional profile of chordomas and chrondrosarcomas was compared to a wide variety of sarcomas as well as to that of normal tissues of similar lineage, to determine whether they express unique gene signatures among other tumors of mesenchymal origin, and to identify changes associated with malignant transformation. A HG-U133A Affymetrix Chip platform was used to determine the gene expression signature in 6 chordoma and 14 chondrosarcoma lesions. Validation of selected genes was performed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on an extended subset of tumors. By unsupervised clustering, chordoma and chondrosarcoma tumors grouped together in a genomic cluster distinct from that of other sarcoma types. They shared overexpression of many extracellular matrix genes including aggrecan, type II &amp; X collagen, fibronectin, matrillin 3, high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA), matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9, and MMP-19. In contrast, T Brachyury and CD24 were selectively expressed in chordomas, as were Keratin 8,13,15,18 and 19. Chondrosarcomas are distinguished by high expression of type IX and XI collagen. Because of its potential usefulness as a target for immunotherapy, the expression of HMW-MAA was analyzed by IHC and was detected in 62% of chordomas and 48% of chondrosarcomas, respectively. Furthermore, western blotting analysis showed that HMW-MAA synthesized by chordoma cell lines has a structure similar to that of the antigen synthesized by melanoma cells. In conclusion, chordomas and chondrosarcomas share a similar gene expression profile of up-regulated extracellular matrix genes. HMW-MAA represents a potential useful target to apply immunotherapy to these tumors.</str>

      <str>The embryonic T-box transcription factor brachyury is aberrantly expressed in a range of human tumors. Previous studies have demonstrated that brachyury is a driver of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer progression. Brachyury expression in human tumor cells enhances tumor invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in vivo, and induces resistance to various conventional therapeutics including chemotherapy and radiation. These characteristics, and the selective expression of brachyury for a range of human tumor types vs. normal adult tissues, make brachyury an attractive tumor target. Due to its intracellular localization and the "undruggable" character of transcription factors, available options to target brachyury are currently limited. Here we report on the development and characterization of an immunological platform for the efficient targeting of brachyury-positive tumors consisting of a heat-killed, recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)-brachyury vector-based vaccine (designated as GI-6301) that expresses the full-length human brachyury protein. We demonstrate that human dendritic cells treated with recombinant yeast-brachyury can activate and expand brachyury-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro that, in turn, can effectively lyse human tumor cells expressing the brachyury protein. Vaccination of mice with recombinant yeast-brachyury is also shown here to elicit brachyury-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and to induce anti-tumor immunity in the absence of toxicity. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial of GI-6301 is currently ongoing in patients with advanced tumors; to our knowledge, this is the first vaccine platform aimed at targeting a driver of tumor EMT that has successfully reached the clinical stage. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare primary malignant bone tumor and there exist only a few established human chordoma cell lines. The scarcity of robust chordoma cell lines has limited the ability to study this tumor. In this report, we describe the establishment of a novel chordoma cell line and characterize its in vitro and in vivo behaviors. The tumor tissue was isolated from a patient with recurrent chordoma of the sacrum. After 6 months in culture, the chordoma cell line, referred here as CH22, was established. Microscopic analysis of two-dimensional culture confirmed that the CH22 cells exhibited a typical vacuolated cytoplasm similar to the well-established chordoma cell line U-CH1. Electron microscopy showed cohesive cells with numerous surface filopodia, pockets of glycogen and aggregates of intermediate tonofilaments in cytoplasm. Three-dimensional culture revealed that the CH22 cells could grow and form clusters by day 8. The MTT assays demonstrated that, compared with sensitive osteosarcoma cell lines, CH22 cells were relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the CH22 cells expressed brachyury, vimentin, and cytokeratin. Finally, histological analysis of CH22 xenograft tumor tissues demonstrated the appearance of physaliphorous cells and positive staining of brachyury, cytokeratin, and S100. By CT and MRI, imaging xenografts showed the typical appearances seen in human chordomas. These findings suggest that the established novel human chordoma cell line CH22 and its tumorigenecity in SCID nude mice may serve as an important model for studying chordoma cell biology and the development of new therapeutic modalities.</str>

      <str>OBJECT Although chondrosarcomas rarely arise in the skull base, chondrosarcomas and chordomas are the 2 major malignant bone neoplasms occurring at this location. The distinction of these 2 tumors is important, but this distinction is occasionally problematic because of radiological and histological overlap. Unlike chordoma and extracranial chondrosarcoma, no case series presenting a whole-genome analysis of skull base chondrosarcomas (SBCSs) has been reported. The goal of this study is to clarify the genetic characteristics of SBCSs and contrast them with those of chordomas. METHODS The authors analyzed 7 SBCS specimens for chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). They also examined IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and brachyury expression. RESULTS In CGH analyses, the authors detected CNAs in 6 of the 7 cases, including chromosomal gains of 8q21.1, 19, 2q22-q32, 5qcen-q14, 8q21-q22, and 15qcen-q14. Mutation of IDH1 was found with a high frequency (5 of 7 cases, 71.4%), of which R132S was most frequently mutated. No IDH2 mutations were found, and immunohistochemical staining for brachyury was negative in all cases. CONCLUSIONS To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first whole-genome study of an SBSC case series. Their findings suggest that these tumors are molecularly consistent with a subset of conventional central chondrosarcomas and different from skull base chordomas. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, low to intermediate grade malignant bone tumors of the axial skeleton. Current treatment options are limited to surgical procedures, as chordomas are largely resistant to conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Cell lines are valuable tools for exploring molecular mechan-isms involved in tumorigenesis and they have a fundamental impact on the development of new anticancer agents. To date, only two chordoma cell lines exist world-wide. In the present study we report a third chordoma cell line, MUG-Chor1, as well as corresponding cultured fibroblasts established from a recur-rent morphologically 'classic' sacrococcygeal chordoma of a 58-year-old Caucasian female. The cells are brachyury-positive and have the characteristics of chordoma. The genetic profile of the primary chordoma and the established chordoma cell line was investigated during the culturing period (early and late passage). MUG-Chor1 is karyotypically, &lt;2n&gt;43-47,XX,del(3)(q1?)[11], +7,del(9)(p1?),der(9;15)(q10;q10),-10,+der(12)t(9;12)(p2?;q1?),der (12)t(12;19)(p;p)t(17;19)(q;q),-15,der(17;21)(q10;q10),der(20)t(10;20) (q25?26?;q11?12?),-21,-22[20]/idemx2[5] and displays known, chordoma-typical genetic changes, such as chromosomal gains at T/brachyury locus (6q27), losses at 9p24.3-p13.1 (includes the CDKN2a/CDKN2b locus), 10p15.3-q23.32 (includes the PTEN locus) and losses of 10q25.2 (includes the PDCD4 locus). MUG-Chor1 bears a marked resemblance to chordomas in vivo and is, therefore, an optimal in vitro chordoma model.</str>

      <str>This work concerns the formation of mesoderm in the development of an enteropneust hemichordate, Ptychodera flava, and the expression of the Brachyury gene during this process. Brachyury expression occurs in two distinct phases. In the embryo, Brachyury is transcribed during gastrulation in the future oral and anal regions of the gut, but transcripts are no longer detected by 2 weeks of development. Brachyury expression is not detected during the 5 months of larval planktonic existence. During this time, the adult coeloms begin to develop, originating as coalescences of cells that appear to delaminate from the wall of the gut. Brachyury expression cannot be detected again until metamorphosis, when transcripts appear in the mesoderm of the adult proboscis, collar and the very posterior region of the trunk. It is also expressed in the posterior end of the gut. At no time is Brachyury expressed in the stomochord, the putative homologue of the chordate notochord. These observations illuminate the process of maximal indirect development in Ptychodera and, by comparison with patterns of Brachyury expression in the indirect development of echinoderms, their sister group, they reveal the evolutionary history of Brachyury utilization in deuterostomes.</str>

      <str>In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of Brachyury expression in prostate tumorigenesis using a large series of human prostate samples comprising benign tissue, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, localized tumor, and metastatic tissues. The results obtained were compared with what can be inferred from the Oncomine database. In addition, multiple in vitro models of prostate cancer were used to dissect the biologic role of Brachyury in prostate cancer progression.</str>
      <str>We found that Brachyury is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer and metastatic tumors when compared with normal tissues, both at protein and at mRNA levels. Brachyury expression in the cytoplasm correlates with highly aggressive tumors, whereas the presence of Brachyury in the nucleus is correlated with tumor invasion. We found that Brachyury-positive cells present higher viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion rates than Brachyury-negative cells. Microarray analysis further showed that genes co-expressed with Brachyury are clustered in oncogenic-related pathways, namely cell motility, cell-cycle regulation, and cell metabolism.</str>

      <str>To gain insights into coordinated lineage-specification and morphogenetic processes during early embryogenesis, here we report a systematic identification of transcriptional programs mediated by a key developmental regulator--Brachyury. High-resolution chromosomal localization mapping of Brachyury by ChIP sequencing and ChIP-exonuclease revealed distinct sequence signatures enriched in Brachyury-bound enhancers. A combination of genome-wide in vitro and in vivo perturbation analysis and cross-species evolutionary comparison unveiled a detailed Brachyury-dependent gene-regulatory network that directly links the function of Brachyury to diverse developmental pathways and cellular housekeeping programs. We also show that Brachyury functions primarily as a transcriptional activator genome-wide and that an unexpected gene-regulatory feedback loop consisting of Brachyury, Foxa2, and Sox17 directs proper stem-cell lineage commitment during streak formation. Target gene and mRNA-sequencing correlation analysis of the T(c) mouse model supports a crucial role of Brachyury in up-regulating multiple key hematopoietic and muscle-fate regulators. Our results thus chart a comprehensive map of the Brachyury-mediated gene-regulatory network and how it influences in vivo developmental homeostasis and coordination.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is required for the normal extension of the anteroposterior axis during mouse embryogenesis. A transgene comprising sequences from -500 to +150 relative to the start of Brachyury transcription, and the reporter gene lacZ, recapitulates some, but not all elements of Brachyury expression. Beta-Galactosidase expression is seen in the primitive streak from 6.5 d.p.c. but there is no detectable reporter expression in the node or notochord. Thus, the regulatory sequences required for the expression of Brachyury in the cells traversing the primitive streak are distinct from those required for the initiation of expression in the node. This suggests that different or additional signals are involved in activation of Brachyury in the node and notochord than those inducing Brachyury in the primitive streak. Additionally, the data suggest the possibility that axial and non-axial mesoderm are distinct from the earliest stages of Brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>Brachyury is a transcription factor that functions in gastrulation and endoderm development throughout the Bilateria. Here, we identify genes that are expressed downstream of brachyury during gastrulation of the sea urchin embryo. Screens with two different complex probes generated by subtractive hybridization were carried out on high-density arrays of embryonic cDNA libraries. An mRNA sequence population from embryos expressing brachyury at its peak stage of expression was subtracted with message sequence from embryos in which Brachyury function had been "knocked-out" by injection of a morpholine-substituted antisense oligonucleotide to generate a differential probe for brachyury target genes. Another probe was made by using an mRNA population from embryos that mis-express brachyury at a stage just prior to the normal onset of expression, subtracted with message sequence taken from normal embryos at this stage. Screens carried out with these probes target overlapping but distinct sets of downstream genes. After partial sequence characterization, promising genes were independently analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and by in situ hybridization. Two major classes of genes emerge in this study: genes expressed in the subset of the secondary mesenchyme cells (SMC) that will become pigment cells, and genes that are expressed in portions of the endoderm coincident with brachyury expression. The latter genes are candidates for direct transcriptional targets of Brachyury. Some of the endodermal genes that respond to Brachyury are cytoskeletal modulators that may play a role in gut morphogenesis. This finding is consistent with the block in gastrulation induced by interfering with Brachyury function in sea urchins, and with known or suggested Brachyury function in other species. Other endodermal target genes are expressed in the archenteron and might be terminal differentiation enzymes of the gut. Brachyury expression patterns for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus reported in this paper are entirely consistent with data from other echinoderm species. Brachyury expression in the vegetal plate is confined to the presumptive endodermal cells. Therefore, the SMC genes are likely to be indirect targets of Brachyury-induced signaling from the surrounding endoderm to the central mesoderm, or the effects on these genes may be indirect consequences of gross disruption of the vegetal plate. These results and other data suggest that the brachyury gene transduces information about the state of endodermal specification to genes that modulate morphogenesis and genes that perform terminal functions in the gut.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor Brachyury is expressed in a number of tumour types and has been demonstrated to have cancer inducing properties. To date, it has been linked to cancer associated induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tumour metastasis and expression of markers for cancer stem-like cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that Brachyury plays an important role in the progression of cancer, although the mechanism through which it functions is poorly understood. Here we show that Brachyury regulates the potential of Brachyury-positive colorectal cancer cells to proliferate and reduced levels of Brachyury result in inhibition of proliferation, with features consistent with the cells entering a quiescent-like state. This inhibition of proliferation is dependent upon p27Kip1 demonstrating that Brachyury acts to modulate cellular proliferative fate in colorectal cancer cells in a p27Kip1-dependent manner. Analysis of patient derived colorectal tumours reveals a heterogeneous localisation of Brachyury (in the nucleolus, nucleus and cytoplasm) indicating the potential complexity of the regulatory role of Brachyury in solid colorectal tumours. </str>

      <str>Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is highly metastatic and resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recently, we reported that the T-box transcription factor Brachyury is a potential regulator of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Specifically, growth of CSCs was found to be controlled by Brachyury knockdown in AdCC. Since CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this finding provides a new principle for therapies targeting CSCs. In the present study, we established that Brachyury knockdown suppresses chemoresistance and radioresistance in vitro. Brachyury was knocked down by transfecting Brachyury short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into the AdCC CSC cell line ACCS-M GFP. Brachyury knockdown significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion and suppressed chemoresistance. A quantitative PCR array of drug transporter genes revealed that knockdown of Brachyury caused down-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter genes. Furthermore, ACCS-M GFP radioresistance was significantly suppressed by Brachyury knockdown. Knockdown of Brachyury significantly sensitized ACCS-M GFP cells to chemoradiotherapy. This study demonstrates that Brachyury knockdown reduces invasiveness and chemoresistance and radioresistance of CSCs in vivo. Therefore, Brachyury knockdown may be a useful therapeutic tool for sensitizing CSCs to conventional chemoradiotherapy.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor Brachyury, a molecule frequently detected in human cancers but seldom found in normal adult tissue, has recently been characterized as a driver of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal switch of human carcinomas. In the current investigation, we present data demonstrating that in two different human lung carcinoma models expression of Brachyury strongly correlates with increased in vitro resistance to cytotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation. We also demonstrate that chemotherapy treatment in vitro selects for tumor cells with high levels of Brachyury and that the degree of resistance to therapy correlates with the level of Brachyury expression. In vitro and in vivo, human lung carcinoma cells with higher levels of Brachyury divide at slower rates than those with lower levels of Brachyury, a phenomenon associated with marked downregulation of cyclin D1, phosphorylated Rb and CDKN1A (p21). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Brachyury binds to a half T-box consensus site located within the promoter region of the p21 gene, indicating a potential mechanism for the observed therapeutic resistance associated with Brachyury expression. Finally, we demonstrate that in vivo treatment of tumor xenografts with chemotherapy results in the selective growth of resistant tumors characterized by high levels of Brachyury expression. Altogether, these results suggest that Brachyury expression may attenuate cell cycle progression, enabling tumor cells to become less susceptible to chemotherapy and radiation in human carcinomas. </str>

      <str>The expression of Brachyury in human HCC (SMMC7721, HepG2, FHCC98, and Hep3B) and control cell lines was analyzed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoflourence methods. Cancerous tissues collected from patients with HCC (n = 112) were analyzed using immunohistochemical method; a microarray analysis of HCC tissues was performed to explore the clinicopathological variables of HCC. The migratory and invasive capacities of Brachyury-SMMC7721 and Brachyury-HepG2 transfected cells were evaluated using in vitro scratch wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Further, six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice (n = 10) model was used in vivo assay.</str>
      <str>Elevated expression of Brachyury was detected in HCCs (62.5%) compared with that in adjacent nontumorous tissues. Clinicopathological analysis revealed a close correlation of Brachyury expression with distant metastasis and poor prognosis of HCC. Overexpression of Brachyury promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Brachyury overexpression enhanced Akt activation by inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which led to subsequent stabilization of Snail, a critical EMT mediator.</str>

      <str>Fifty brachyury-verified chordoma specimens of 34 primary and 16 recurrent tumors of 44 patients were tested for ezrin, MMP-9, and COX-2 as possible therapeutical targets by immunohistochemistry. The clinical evaluation concentrated on tumor location, volume, and age-related data.</str>

Patients' survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.01), tumor location (P = 0.029), and tumor volume (P = 0.002).

      <str>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is believed to originate from notochordal remnants. We previously identified germline T duplication as a major susceptibility mechanism in several chordoma families. Recently, a common genetic variant in T (rs2305089) was significantly associated with the risk of sporadic chordoma. We sequenced all T exons in 24 familial cases and 54 unaffected family members from eight chordoma families (three with T duplications), 103 sporadic cases, and 160 unrelated controls. We also measured T copy number variation in all sporadic cases. We confirmed the association between the previously reported variant rs2305089 and risk of familial [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93, 7.25, P = 0.067] and sporadic chordoma (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.89, 4.29, P &lt; 0.0001). We also identified a second common variant, rs1056048, that was strongly associated with chordoma in families (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 1.43, 11.92, P = 0.0086). Among sporadic cases, another common variant (rs3816300) was significantly associated with risk when jointly analyzed with rs2305089. The association with rs3816300 was significantly stronger in cases with early age onset. In addition, we identified three rare variants that were only observed among sporadic chordoma cases, all of which have potential functional relevance based on in silico predictions. Finally, we did not observe T duplication in any sporadic chordoma case. Our findings further highlight the importance of the T gene in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic chordoma and suggest a complex susceptibility related to T.</str>

      <str>Widespread expression of the DNA-binding protein Brachyury in Xenopus animal caps causes ectopic mesoderm formation. In this paper, we first show that two types of mesoderm are induced by different concentrations of Brachyury. Animal pole explants from embryos injected with low doses of Xbra RNA differentiate into vesicles containing mesothelial smooth muscle and mesenchyme. At higher concentrations somitic muscle is formed. The transition from smooth muscle formation to that of somitic muscle occurs over a two-fold increase in Brachyury concentration. Brachyury is required for differentiation of notochord in mouse and fish embryos, but even the highest concentrations of Brachyury do not induce this tissue in Xenopus animal caps. Co-expression of Brachyury with the secreted glycoprotein noggin does cause notochord formation, but it is difficult to understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon without knowing more about the noggin signal transduction pathway. To overcome this difficulty, we have now tested mesoderm-specific transcription factors for the ability to synergize with Brachyury. We find that co-expression of Pintallavis, but not goosecoid, with Brachyury causes formation of dorsal mesoderm, including notochord. Furthermore, the effect of Pintallavis, like that of Brachyury, is dose-dependent: a two-fold increase in Pintallavis RNA causes a transition from ventral mesoderm formation to that of muscle, and a further two-fold increase induces notochord and neural tissue. These results suggest that Pintallavis cooperates with Brachyury to pattern the mesoderm in Xenopus.</str>

We have identified a second zebrafish Brachyury ortholog (Bra), and show that a combined loss of Ntl and Bra recapitulates the mouse phenotype, demonstrating an ancient role for Brachyury in patterning all but the most anterior somites. Using cell transplantation, we show that the only essential role for Brachyury during somite formation is non-cell autonomous, and demonstrate that Ntl and Bra are required for and can induce expression of the canonical Wnts wnt8 and wnt3a.

      <str>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β1 is one of well-recognized factors contributing to renal fibrosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of EMT are not fully understood. Brachyury, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, was recently identified as an important factor promoting EMT in human carcinoma cell lines. There is no evidence that Brachyury is involved in renal tubular EMT.</str>
      <str>Our results demonstrated that Brachyury was prominently induced in TGF-β1-treated human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells and that this induction was accompanied by changes characteristic of EMT. Blockage of Brachyury expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in HK-2 cells effectively reversed the TGF-β1-induced EMT phenotype. Brachyury induction repressed E-cadherin transcription; the E-cadherin promoter contains a Brachyury binding site, and decreased expression of E-cadherin occurred in Brachyury-overexpressing cells when they were transfected with reporter constructs using the promoter. This effect was partially mediated by Slug and Snail, as knockdown of Snail and Slug by siRNA effectively reversed Brachyury-mediated EMT and partially restored E-cadherin expression. The expression of Brachyury also presented in a rat model of obstructive nephropathy and in tubulointerstitial fibrosis tissues of IgA nephropathy, suggesting that it may have a role in EMT and renal fibrosis in vivo.</str>

      <str>Metastatic disease is responsible for the majority of human cancer deaths. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of metastasis is a major step in designing effective cancer therapeutics. Here we show that the T-box transcription factor Brachyury induces in tumor cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important step in the progression of primary tumors toward metastasis. Overexpression of Brachyury in human carcinoma cells induced changes characteristic of EMT, including upregulation of mesenchymal markers, downregulation of epithelial markers, and an increase in cell migration and invasion. Brachyury overexpression also repressed E-cadherin transcription, an effect partially mediated by Slug. Conversely, inhibition of Brachyury resulted in downregulation of mesenchymal markers and loss of cell migration and invasion and diminished the ability of human tumor cells to form lung metastases in a xenograft model. Furthermore, we found Brachyury to be overexpressed in various human tumor tissues and tumor cell lines compared with normal tissues. We also determined that the percentage of human lung tumor tissues positive for Brachyury expression increased with the stage of the tumor, indicating a potential association between Brachyury and tumor progression. The selective expression of Brachyury in tumor cells and its role in EMT and cancer progression suggest that Brachyury may be an attractive target for antitumor therapies.</str>

To understand the function of Brachyury-downstream genes in chordate embryos, from a series of our survey on differential expression, including subtractive hybridization, dot-blot assays, EST sequences and the expression patterns in whole-mount in situ hybridization at embryonic stages, we developed a knowledge database called "CINOBI: CionaNotochord and Brachyury-downstream gene Index" to create comprehensive catalogues of Brachyury-downstream gene sets in Ciona intestinalis. Combining genome and large-scale cDNA data, we were able to characterize 450 non-redundant Brachyury-downstream genes: Twenty-four genes were newly annotated as notochord-expressed genes. Several genes are components of signaling pathways such as Wnt/PCP, Nf kappaB and TGF-beta signaling.

      <str>The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of Brachyury on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and chemosensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In 115 archived NSCLC tissue samples, the expression of Brachyury was observed to be significantly higher than that in adjacent normal lung tissues. In addition, the current study demonstrated that the expression of Brachyury is closely associated with TNM staging, lymph node metastasis and the prognosis of NSCLC, although not with patient age, gender or tumor differentiation. Brachyury expression is also accompanied by the downregulation of E-cadherin and the upregulation of N-cadherin. Brachyury may promote lung cancer through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which leads to metastasis and consequent poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, the present study observed that interfering with Brachyury increases the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic treatment with cisplatin.

      <str>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be a critical step along the metastasis of carcinomas. In addition to gaining motility and invasiveness, tumor cells that undergo EMT also acquire increased resistance to many traditional cancer treatment modalities, including chemotherapy and radiation. As such, EMT has become an attractive, potentially targetable process for therapeutic interventions against tumor metastasis. The process of EMT is driven by a group of transcription factors designated as EMT transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and the recently identified T-box family member, Brachyury. In an attempt to determine which of these drivers of EMT is more amenable to targeted therapies and, in particular, T-cell-mediated immunotherapeutic approaches, we have examined their relative expression levels in a range of human and murine normal tissues, cancer cell lines, and human tumor biopsies. Our results demonstrated that Brachyury is a molecule with a highly restricted human tumor expression pattern. We also demonstrated that Brachyury is immunogenic and that Brachyury-specific CD8(+) T cells expanded in vitro are able to lyse Brachyury-positive tumor cells. We thus propose Brachyury as an attractive target for vaccination strategies designed to specifically target tumor cells undergoing EMT.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a member of the T-box transcription family, has been suggested to be essential for morphogenetic movements in various processes of animal development. However, little is known about its critical transcriptional targets. In order to identify targets of Brachyury and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying morphogenetic movements, we first searched the genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis, the only amphibian genomic sequence available, for Brachyury-binding sequences known as T-half sites, and then screened for the ones conserved between vertebrate genomes. We found three genes that have evolutionarily conserved T-half sites in the promoter regions and examined these genes experimentally to determine whether their expressions were regulated by Brachyury, using the animal cap system of Xenopus laevis embryos. Eventually, we obtained evidence that vimentin, encoding an intermediate filament protein, was a potential target of Brachyury. This is the first report to demonstrate that Brachyury might affect the cytoskeletal structure through regulating the expression of an intermediate filament protein, vimentin.</str>

      <str>The embryonic transcription factor brachyury is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, including lung, breast, colon and prostate carcinomas, chordomas and hemangioblastomas. In human carcinoma cells, overexpression of brachyury associates with the occurrence of the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquisition of metastatic propensity and resistance to a variety of anti-cancer therapeutics. Brachyury is preferentially expressed in human tumors vs. normal adult tissues, and high levels of this molecule associate with poor prognosis in patients with lung, colon and prostate carcinomas, and in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Brachyury is immunogenic in humans and vaccines against this novel oncotarget are currently undergoing clinical investigation. While our group and others have employed various anti-brachyury antibodies to interrogate the above findings, we report here on the development and thorough characterization of a novel rabbit monoclonal antibody (MAb 54-1) that reacts with distinct high affinity and specificity with human brachyury. MAb 54-1 was successfully used in ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to evaluate expression of brachyury in various human tumor cell lines and tissues. We propose the use of this antibody to assist in research studies of EMT and in prognostic studies for a range of human tumors. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are primary malignant tumors of the notochord that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and their clinical relevance in chordoma remain unknown. We evaluated PD-L1 expression in three chordoma cell lines and nine chordoma tissue samples by western blot. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on a chordoma tissue microarray (TMA) that contained 78 tissue specimens. We also correlated the expression of PD-L1 and TILs with clinical outcomes. PD-L1 protein expression was demonstrated to be induced by IFN-γ in both UCH1 and UCH2 cell lines. Across nine human chordoma tissue samples, PD-L1 protein was differentially expressed. 94.9% of chordoma samples showed positive PD-L1 expression in the TMA. The expression score of PD-L1 for metastatic chordoma tumors was significant higher as compared with non-metastatic chordoma tumors. Expression of PD-L1 protein significantly correlates with the presence of elevated TILs, which correlates with metastasis. In summary, our study showed high levels of PD-L1 are expressed in chordoma, which is correlated with the prevalence of TILs. The current study suggests targeting PD-L1 may be a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for chordoma clinical trials. </str>

      <str>It has previously been shown that human beta-microseminoprotein enhances development of mesodermal structures in the chick embryo. The present study was carried out to elucidate the mechanism of action of human beta-microseminoprotein in the chick embryo. beta-Microseminoprotein brought about significant modulation of expression of Brachyury in gastrulating embryos. In approximately 50% of the treated embryos, Brachyury expression was enhanced around the Hensen's node. These cells not only expressed higher levels of Brachyury, but also appeared to switch off Brachyury expression prematurely, postinvagination. The spatial modulation of Brachyury is not clearly reflected in the northern blots, indicating that beta-microseminoprotein treatment results in redistribution of available transcripts or that the upregulation is compensated for by early switching off of Brachyury postinvagination. Because higher levels of Brachyury during gastrulation are believed to result in early exit of cells from the primitive streak, beta-microseminoprotein treatment appeared to have stimulated morphogenetic movements by upregulating Brachyury around the Hensen's node. This deduction was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic analysis that showed that altered morphogenetic movements accompany modulation of Brachyury. The specific responses elicited by beta-microseminoprotein indicate presence of a structurally related molecule in the chick. By western blotting, similar molecules were indeed detected in the chicken seminal plasma and in chick embryos. These data strongly suggest that beta-microseminoprotein-related molecule(s) participates in mesoderm formation in the chick embryo.</str>

It contains a notochord composed of just 40 cells, but as in vertebrates Brachyury is essential for notochord differentiation. Here, we show that the misexpression of the Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra) of Ciona intestinalis is sufficient to transform endoderm into notochord. Subtractive hybridization screens were conducted to identify potential Brachyury target genes that are induced upon Ci-Bra misexpression. Of 501 independent cDNA clones that were surveyed, 38 were specifically expressed in notochord cells. These potential Ci-Bra downstream genes appear to encode a broad spectrum of divergent proteins associated with notochord formation.</str>

      <str>Soft tissue chordomas (STCs) have never been systematically studied because of their rarity and the difficulty in separating them from similar-appearing lesions. Using brachyury to confirm the diagnosis, we have analyzed our experience with 11 cases. Cases coded as "chordoma" or "parachordoma" were retrieved from institutional and consultation files (1989 to 2011) and were excluded from further analysis if they arose from the bone or in a patient with previous axial chordoma. Eleven of 27 cases met inclusion criteria. Patients (8 male; 3 female) ranged in age from 13 to 71 years (mean 44 y). Tumors were located on the buttock (n=2), wrist (n=2), leg (n=2), toe (n=1), thumb (n=1), ankle (n=1), shoulder (n=1), and chest wall (n=1), ranged in size from 0.5 to 10.9 cm (mean 5.3 cm), and consisted of cords and syncytia of spindled/epithelioid cells with vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm and a partially myxoid background. Tumors expressed brachyury (10/10), 1 or more cytokeratins (11/11), and S100 protein (10/11). Follow-up information was available for 10 patients (69 mo; range, 2 to 212 mo). Most (n=6) were alive without disease, 2 developed local recurrence and lung metastases, and 1 developed lung metastasis only. One died with unknown disease status. STCs are histologically identical to osseous ones, but differ in their greater tendency to occur in distal locations where small size and surgical resectability result in better disease control. The existence of STC implies that notochordal remnants are not a prerequisite for chordoma development.</str>

      <str>Brachyury(+) mesodermal cell population with purity over 79% was obtained from differentiating brachyury embryonic stem cells (ESC) generated with brachyury promoter driven enhanced green fluorescent protein and puromycin-N-acetyltransferase. A comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of brachyury(+) cells enriched with puromycin application from 6-day-old embryoid bodies (EBs), 6-day-old control EBs and undifferentiated ESCs led to identification of 1573 uniquely up-regulated and 1549 uniquely down-regulated transcripts in brachyury(+) cells. Furthermore, transcripts up-regulated in brachyury(+) cells have overrepresented the Gene Ontology annotations (cell differentiation, blood vessel morphogenesis, striated muscle development, placenta development and cell motility) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotations (mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and transforming growth factor beta signaling). Transcripts representing Larp2 and Ankrd34b are notably up-regulated in brachyury(+) cells. Knockdown of Larp2 resulted in a significantly down-regulation BMP-2 expression, and knockdown of Ankrd34b resulted in alteration of NF-H, PPARγ and PECAM1 expression. The elucidation of transcriptomic signatures of ESCs-derived brachyury(+) cells will contribute toward defining the genetic and cellular identities of presumptive mesodermal cells. Furthermore, there is a possible involvement of Larp2 in the regulation of the late mesodermal marker BMP-2. Ankrd34b might be a positive regulator of neurogenesis and a negative regulator of adipogenesis. </str>

      <str>When aggregated and treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), P19 embryonal carcinoma cells differentiate into cell types normally derived from the mesoderm and endoderm including epithelium and cardiac and skeletal muscle. The Brachyury gene is expressed transiently in these differentiating cultures several days before the appearance of markers of the differentiated cell types. The expression of Brachyury is not affected by DMSO but is induced by cell aggregation, which requires extracellular calcium. Expression of Brachyury is also induced by various members of the TGF beta family such as activin and bone morphogenetic proteins. D3 is a mutant clone of P19 cells selected for its failure to differentiate when aggregated in DMSO.

      <str>The T-Box transcription factor Brachyury plays important roles in the development of all bilateral animals examined so far. In order to understand the ancestral function of Brachyury we cloned NemBra1, a Brachyury homolog from the anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Anthozoa are considered the basal group among the Cnidaria. First NemBra1 expression could be detected at the blastula/gastrula transition and gene activity persists until adulthood of the animals. In situ hybridization shows that NemBra1 expression in gastrulae and early planula larvae is restricted to a circle around the blastopore. When the larvae begin to metamorphose into primary polyps, the expression zone extends into the developing mesenteries. In adult polyps Brachyury expression persists in the mesenteries, but is excluded from the septal filament and the differentiated retractor muscles, which also develop from the mesenteries. We conclude that the ancestral function of Brachyury was in specifying the blastopore and its endodermal derivatives.</str>

Brachyury suppressed the capability of human lung cancer cells to attract macrophages. Using PCR array, we found that Brachyury inhibited expression of several chemokines, including CCL2, CCL4, and CXCL10. Accordingly, knockdown of CCL2 and CCL4 in lung cancer cells suppressed macrophage invasion under coculture conditions. Furthermore, we found that Brachyury expression was inversely correlated with CCL2 and CCL4 expression in human lung tumors.

The Brachyury gene is responsible for formation of the notochord, the most defining feature of chordates, and thus may be a key to understanding the origin and evolution of the chordates. Previous studies have shown that the ascidian Brachyury (As-T and Ci-Bra) is expressed in the notochord and that a sea urchin Brachyury (HpTa) is expressed in the secondary mesenchyme founder cells. A recent study by [Tagawa et al.

      <str>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process associated with the metastasis of solid tumors as well as with the acquisition of resistance to standard anticancer modalities. A major initiator of EMT in carcinoma cells is TGF-β, which has been shown to induce the expression of several transcription factors ultimately responsible for initiating and maintaining the EMT program. We have previously identified Brachyury, a T-box transcription factor, as an inducer of mesenchymal features in human carcinoma cells. In this study, a potential link between Brachyury and TGF-β signaling has been investigated. The results show for the first time that Brachyury expression is enhanced during TGF-β1-induced EMT in various human cancer cell lines, and that a positive feedback loop is established between Brachyury and TGF-β1 in mesenchymal-like tumor cells. In this context, Brachyury overexpression is shown to promote upregulation of TGF-β1 at the mRNA and protein levels, an effect mediated by activation of the TGF-β1 promoter in the presence of high levels of Brachyury. Furthermore, inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling by a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-β receptor type I decreases Brachyury expression, induces a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, and renders cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. This study thus has implications for the future development of clinical trials using TGF-β inhibitors in combination with other anticancer agents.</str>

      <str>Understanding the events that led to the emergence of the bilaterians is a daunting task, impaired by the huge evolutionary gap separating us from the pre-Cambrian. During gastrulation, the expression of the transcription factor Brachyury is remarkably well conserved around the blastopore of bilaterians and cnidarians. Only the bilaterian Brachyury proteins, however, share a distinctive N-terminal sequence not found in outgroups such as cnidarians, sponges or placozoans. We now know that, in vertebrates, this N-terminal domain confers specific transcriptional activity, by recruiting Smad1, the first identified co-factor for Brachyury. Smad1 is an effector of the BMP pathway, and has been isolated in bilaterians and cnidarians. Here, I propose that the protein-protein interaction between Brachyury and Smad1 represents an evolutionary novelty of the Urbilateria. The gain of the N-terminal domain might have been selected to spatially modulate the activity of Brachyury, thereby facilitating the establishment of bilateral symmetry during gastrulation movements.</str>

Transcriptional and protein analyses demonstrated overlapping expression of Mixl1 and Brachyury during embryonic stem cell differentiation. In vitro protein interaction studies showed that the Mixl1 with Brachyury associated via their DNA-binding domains and gel shift assays revealed that the Brachyury T-box domain bound to Mixl1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter experiments indicated that association of Mixl1 with Brachyury and related T-box factors inhibited the transactivating potential of Mixl1 on the Gsc and Pdgfrα promoters.

The tumor was clinically diagnosed as a benign neurogenic tumor and the tumor was easily removed surgically. Microscopically, the tumor mainly consisted of tumor cells with extensively vacuolated cytoplasm, arranged in cord- and nest-like fashion against a myxoid matrix background. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed diffuse positivity for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin. The tumor cell nuclei were positive for brachyury, which is a key transcription factor of notochordal development.

      <str>An experimental study to investigate the characterization of 3 chordoma cell lines.</str>
      <str>To characterize chordoma cell lines and generate hypothesis for further chordoma studies.</str>
      <str>Three cultured human chordoma cell lines have been successfully generated; however, their characterization is incomplete. Complete characterization of chordoma cell lines is necessary for these reagents to be a useful preclinical model.</str>
      <str>Three chordoma cell lines, CH 8, U-CH1, and GP 60, were cultured in different commercially available tissue culture media. They were also cultured in different environments, which included collagen substrate, various concentrations of glucose, and various levels of hypoxic conditions. The rate of cell proliferation was assessed by either MTT or numeration assay. A 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture model of these chordoma cell lines was also studied, and the expression of vimentin and cytokeratin was measured by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Additionally, the sensitivity of the 3 chordoma cell lines to 6 chemotherapeutic drugs was analyzed.</str>
      <str>CH 8, GP 60, and U-CH1 cells proliferate more actively in Iscove Modified Dulbecco Medium or Dulbecco modified Eagle Medium and less actively in RPMI medium. All 3 chordoma cell lines universally grow better in collagen substrate and survive in hypoxic conditions, whereas glucose concentration has no significant influence on their growth properties. Chordoma cell lines grew well in 3D culture systems and formed acini-like spheroids and retained the expression of vimentin and cytokeratin. MTT analysis indicates that all 3 chordoma cell lines are sensitive to doxorubicin, yondelis, zalypsis, and cisplatin.</str>

      <str>To investigate the role of histone H3K27 demethylase UTX in embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, we have generated UTX knockout (KO) and enzyme-dead knock-in male ES cells. Deletion of the X-chromosome-encoded UTX gene in male ES cells markedly decreases expression of the paralogous UTY gene encoded by Y chromosome, but has no effect on global H3K27me3 level, Hox gene expression, or ES cell self-renewal. However, UTX KO cells show severe defects in mesoderm differentiation and induction of Brachyury, a transcription factor essential for mesoderm development. Surprisingly, UTX regulates mesoderm differentiation and Brachyury expression independent of its enzymatic activity. UTY, which lacks detectable demethylase activity, compensates for the loss of UTX in regulating Brachyury expression. UTX and UTY bind directly to Brachyury promoter and are required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling-induced Brachyury expression in ES cells. Interestingly, male UTX KO embryos express normal levels of UTY and survive until birth. In contrast, female UTX KO mice, which lack the UTY gene, show embryonic lethality before embryonic day 11.5. Female UTX KO embryos show severe defects in both Brachyury expression and embryonic development of mesoderm-derived posterior notochord, cardiac, and hematopoietic tissues. These results indicate that UTX controls mesoderm differentiation and Brachyury expression independent of H3K27 demethylase activity, and suggest that UTX and UTY are functionally redundant in ES cell differentiation and early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for the formation of posterior mesoderm and for axial development in both mouse and zebrafish embryos. In these species, and in Xenopus, the gene is expressed transiently throughout the presumptive mesoderm, and transcripts then persiste in notochord and posterior tissues. In Xenopus embryos, expression of the Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, can be induced in presumptive ectoderm by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin; in the absence of functional FGF or activin signalling pathways, expression of the gene is severely reduced. Ectopic expression of Xbra in presumptive ectoderm causes mesoderm to be formed. As Brachyury and its homologues encode sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, it is likely that each functions by directly activating downstream mesoderm-specific genes.</str>
      <str>We show that expression in Xenopus embryos of RNA encoding a dominant-negative FGF receptor inhibits the mesoderm-inducing activity of Xbra. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Xbra activates transcription of the embryonic FGF gene, and that embryonic FGF can induce expression of Xbra. This suggests that the two genes are components of a regulatory loop. Consistent with this idea, dissociation of Xbra-expressing cells causes a dramatic and rapid reduction in levels of Xbra, but the reduction can be inhibited by addition of FGF.</str>
      <str>Formation of mesoderm tissue requires an intact FGF signalling pathway downstream of Brachyury. This requirement is due to a regulatory loop, in which Brachyury activates expression of a member of the FGF family, and FGF maintains expression of Brachyury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>Orthologues of Brachyury, a subfamily of T-box transcription factors, specify distinct cell types in different metazoan phyla, suggesting that the function of these genes has changed through the course of evolution. To investigate this evolutionary process, we have compared the activities of Brachyury orthologues from all major phyla in a single cellular context, the pluripotent Xenopus laevis animal cap. In this assay, an ancestral function is revealed: most orthologues, including the Hydra protein, mimic the action of endogenous Xenopus Brachyury, in that they induce mesoderm but not endoderm. Orthologues from Drosophila and ascidians, however, display an additional derived property, represented in our assay by the induction of endoderm. Misexpression of chimeric versions of Brachyury reveals that the C-terminal half of the protein is important for the strength of the induced response but not for its specificity. In contrast, amino acids located within the T-domain and in a short N-terminal peptide are involved in restricting the activity of Brachyury proteins to induction of mesoderm and not endoderm. Possession of this N-terminal motif is correlated with early circumblastoporal expression of Brachyury orthologues. We propose that restriction of Brachyury activity by this motif plays a conserved role in the control of Bilaterian gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Recent studies have revealed that expression of miRNA-1 (miR-1) is frequently down-regulated in several cancer types including chordoma. Identifying and validating novel targets of miR-1 is useful for understanding the roles of miR-1 in chordoma. We aimed to further investigate the functions of miR-1 in chordoma. Specifically, we assessed whether restoration of miR-1 affects cell migration and invasion in chordoma, and focused on the miR-1 potential target Slug gene. Migratory and invasive activities were assessed by wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Slug expression was evaluated by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Restoration of miR-1 expression suppressed the migratory and invasive activities of chordoma cells. Transfection of miR-1 inhibited cell proliferation both time- and dose-dependently in chordoma. MiR-1 transfected cells showed inhibited Slug expression. Slug was over-expressed in chordoma cell lines and advanced chordoma tissues. In conclusion, we have shown that miR-1 directly targets the Slug gene in chordoma. Restoration of miR-1 suppressed not only proliferation, but also migratory and invasive activities, and reduced the Slug expression in chordoma cells. These results collectively indicate that miR-1/Slug pathway is a potential therapeutic target because of its crucial roles in chordoma cell growth and migration.</str>

      <str>The role of Brachyury and other T-box genes in the differentiation of mesoderm and endoderm of vertebrates is well established. Recently, homologues of Brachyury have been isolated from an increasing number of diverse organisms ranging from Cnidaria to vertebrates and insects. Comparative expression and function analysis allows the origin of the mesoderm and the evolution of the developmental role of Brachyury gene family in metazoans to be traced. The data suggest that an ancestral function of Brachyury was to designate a blastoporal region that had distinct properties in induction and axis elongation. A subset of blastoporal cells expressing Brachyury and other genes that convey specific mesodermal functions may have segregated as a distinct cell population from this region in the course of mesoderm evolution.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor Brachyury (T) is essential for formation of the posterior mesoderm and the notochord in vertebrate embryos. Work in the frog and the zebrafish has identified some direct genomic targets of Brachyury, but little is known about Brachyury targets in the mouse.</str>
      <str>Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation and mouse promoter microarrays to identify targets of Brachyury in embryoid bodies formed from differentiating mouse ES cells. The targets we identify are enriched for sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and include components of signal transduction pathways that direct cell fate in the primitive streak and tailbud of the early embryo. Expression of some of these targets, such as Axin2, Fgf8 and Wnt3a, is down regulated in Brachyury mutant embryos and we demonstrate that they are also Brachyury targets in the human. Surprisingly, we do not observe enrichment of the canonical T-domain DNA binding sequence 5'-TCACACCT-3' in the vicinity of most Brachyury target genes. Rather, we have identified an (AC)(n) repeat sequence, which is conserved in the rat but not in human, zebrafish or Xenopus. We do not understand the significance of this sequence, but speculate that it enhances transcription factor binding in the regulatory regions of Brachyury target genes in rodents.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare primary bone malignancy that arises in the skull base, spine and sacrum and originates from remnants of the notochord. These tumors are typically resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and to date there are no FDA-approved agents to treat chordoma. The lack of in vivo models of chordoma has impeded the development of new therapies for this tumor. Primary tumor from a sacral chordoma was xenografted into NOD/SCID/IL-2R γ-null mice. The xenograft is serially transplantable and was characterized by both gene expression analysis and whole genome SNP genotyping. The NIH Chemical Genomics Center performed high-throughput screening of 2,816 compounds using two established chordoma cell lines, U-CH1 and U-CH2B. The screen yielded several compounds that showed activity and two, sunitinib and bortezomib, were tested in the xenograft. Both agents slowed the growth of the xenograft tumor. Sensitivity to an inhibitor of IκB, as well as inhibition of an NF-κB gene expression signature demonstrated the importance of NF-κB signaling for chordoma growth. This serially transplantable chordoma xenograft is thus a practical model to study chordomas and perform in vivo preclinical drug testing. </str>

Twenty-five clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs), 19 clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOCs), 20 cases of adrenal cortical carcinomas(ACCs), and 10 chordomas were stained for renal cell carcinoma marker (RCC Ma), Pax8, brachyury, and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). The extent of stains was scored as focal (&lt;25%), nonfocal (25%-50%), and diffuse (&gt;50%). The intensity was scored as weak, moderate, and strong. Twenty-two CCRCCs were positive for RCC Ma (88%) and Pax8 (88%), respectively. The RCC Ma cytoplasmic staining was largely diffuse (76%) and strong (76%). The nuclear Pax8 staining was usually diffuse (76%) and moderate (64%) to strong (8%). All of CCRCCs were negative for brachyury and SF-1. All of 19 CCOCs were positive for Pax8 nuclear staining. The staining was diffuse, moderate (21%) to strong (79%). All of CCOCs were negative for RCC Ma, brachyury, and SF-1. All of 20 ACCs were positive for SF-1 nuclear staining. The staining was largely diffuse (95%), moderate (55%) to strong (15%). All of ACC were negative for RCC Ma, Pax8, and brachyury. All of 10 chordomas were positive for brachyury nuclear staining.

      <str>Homologues of the murine Brachyury (T) gene have been cloned from several vertebrates, and are implicated in mesoderm formation and in differentiation of the notochord. In contrast, the roles of the ascidian Brachyury gene may be restricted to presumptive notochord. To understand the evolution of Brachyury genes and their developmental roles, we have searched for homologues in amphioxus, representing the third chordate subphylum and the probable closest relative of the vertebrates. We report the isolation of two amphioxus cDNA clones with clear homology to Brachyury genes, and demonstrate that these derive from separate loci resultant from a recent gene duplication. This finding represents an exception to the emerging consensus of an archetypal prevertebrate genome in amphioxus. The spatial and temporal distribution of Brachyury transcripts during amphioxus development is remarkably similar to vertebrate Brachyury, in presumptive mesoderm, posterior mesoderm and the notochord. Gene expression extends throughout the anteroposterior axis of the notochord, despite the most rostral regions being a more recent specialization; it also persists into larval stages, despite differentiation into contractile tissue. We propose that roles of Brachyury in notochord differentiation are more ancient than roles in mesoderm formation, and that the latter are shared by cephalochordates and all vertebrates.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury gene has a critical role in the formation of posterior mesoderm and notochord in vertebrate development. A recent study showed that Brachyury is also responsible for the formation of the left-right (L-R) axis in mouse and zebrafish. However, the role of Brachyury in L-R axis specification is still elusive. Here, it is demonstrated that Brachyury is involved in L-R specification of the Xenopus laevis embryo and regulates expression of Zic3, which controls the L-R specification process. Overexpression of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) and dominant-negative type Xbra (Xbra-EnR) altered the orientation of heart and gut looping, concomitant with disturbed laterality of nodal-related 1 (Xnr1) and Pitx2 expression, both of which are normally expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm. Furthermore, activation of inducible type Xbra (Xbra-GR) induces Zic3 expression within 20 min. These results suggest that a role of Brachyury in L-R specification may be the direct regulation of Zic3 expression.</str>

      <str>Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures in cancer may have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value, but there is no data on miRNA expression in chordoma. The purpose of this study was to identify the role of miRNAs in human chordoma. We analyzed miRNA expression in chordoma-derived cell lines and chordoma tissue by using miRNA microarray technology with unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. The relative expression levels of these miRNAs were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. To characterize the potential role of miRNA-1, miRNA-1 was stably transfected into a chordoma cell line, UCH1. The expression of miRNA-1 targeted gene Met in chordoma tissues was also studied. We observe that human chordoma tissues and cell lines can be distinguished from normal muscle tissue by comparing miRNA expression profiles. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed in chordoma cell lines compared to controls, and similar expression patterns were found in primary chordoma tissues. Importantly, we were able to show for the first time, to our knowledge, that expression of miRNA-1 and miRNA-206, two miRNAs implicated in a number of other cancer types, were markedly decreased in both chordoma tissues and cell lines. When chordoma cell lines were transfected with miRNA-1, downregulation of known miRNA-1 targets was observed. These targets included Met and HDAC4-two genes that were observed to be overexpressed in chordoma.

      <str>Brachyury is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator that is essential for notochord differentiation in a variety of chordates. In vertebrates, Brachyury is expressed throughout the presumptive mesoderm, but becomes restricted to the notochord at later stages of development. In ascidians, such as Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in the notochord and does not exhibit an early pan-mesodermal pattern. Subtractive hybridization screens were recently used to identify potential Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) target genes (Takahashi, H., Hotta, K., Erives, A., Di Gregorio, A., Zeller, R. W., Levine, M. and Satoh, N. (1999). Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). Of the genes that were identified in this screen, one corresponds to a new member of the tropomyosin superfamily, Ciona tropomyosin (Ci-trop). Here we show that Ci-trop is specifically expressed in the developing notochord beginning at gastrulation, and expression persists in the notochord during tailbud and tadpole stages. A 3 kb region of the Ci-trop 5'-flanking sequence was characterized via electroporation of lacZ fusion genes into fertilized Ciona eggs. A minimal, 114 bp enhancer was identified that is sufficient to direct the expression of a heterologous promoter in the notochord. DNA binding assays indicate that this enhancer contains two sets of low-affinity Brachyury half-sites, which are bound in vitro by a GST/Ci-Bra fusion protein. Deletion of the distal sites inactivates the notochord-specific staining pattern mediated by an otherwise normal Ci-trop/lacZ transgene. These results suggest that Ci-trop is a direct target gene of Ci-Bra and that Brachyury plays an immediate role in the cellular morphogenesis of the notochord.</str>

As the proliferative potential of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is limited, it is crucial to understand how MesP1 expression is mediated in order to achieve reasonable and reliable yields for novel stem cell-based therapeutic options. As potential upstream regulators of MesP1, we therefore analysed Eomes and Brachyury(T), which had been controversially discussed as being crucial for cardiovasculogenic lineage formation.</str>
      <str>Wild-type and transgenic murine embryonic stem cell lines, mRNA analyses, embryoid body formation, and cell sorting revealed that the MesP1 positive population emerges from the Brachyury(T) positive fraction. In situ hybridizations using wild-type mouse embryos confirmed that Brachyury(T) colocalises with MesP1 in vivo. Likewise, shRNA-based loss of Brachyury(T) causes a dramatic decrease in MesP1 expression accompanied by reduced cardiac markers in differentiating embryonic stem cells, which is reflected in vivo via in situ hybridizations using Brachyury(T) knock-out embryos where MesP1 mRNA is greatly abolished.

      <str>Brachyury proteins, a conserved subgroup of the T domain transcription factors, specify gut and posterior mesoderm derivatives throughout the animal kingdom. The T domain confers DNA-binding properties to Brachyury proteins, but little is known how these proteins regulate their target genes. We characterized a direct target gene of the Drosophila Brachyury-homolog Brachyenteron. Brachyenteron activates the homeobox gene orthopedia in a dose-dependent manner via multiple binding sites with the consensus (A/G)(A/T)(A/T)NTN(A/G)CAC(C/T)T. The sites and their A/T-rich flanking regions are conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. Reporter assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate that Brachyenteron binding sites confer in part additive, in part synergistic effects on otp transcription levels. This suggests an interaction of Brachyenteron proteins on the DNA, which we could map to a conserved motif within the T domain. Mouse Brachyury also interacts with Brachyenteron through this motif. We further show that the Xenopus and mouse Brachyury homologs activate orthopedia expression when expressed in Drosophila embryonic cells. We propose that the mechanisms to achieve target gene expression through variable binding sites and through defined protein-protein interactions might be conserved for Brachyury relatives.</str>

The goal of this follow-up study is to investigate the expression of miR-1 as a prognostic biomarker and further confirm the functional role of miR-1 in chordoma cell growth and proliferation. We determined the relative expression levels of miR-1 and Met in chordoma tissue samples and correlated those to clinical variables. The results showed that miR-1 was downregulated in 93.7% of chordoma tissues and expression was inversely correlated with Met expression. miR-1 expression levels also correlated with clinical prognosis.

Cell Proliferation Assay and MTT were used to evaluate cell growth and proliferation. Restoring expression of miR-1 precursor decreased cell growth and proliferation in UCH-1 and CH-22 cells.

      <str>Chordomas are malignant tumors of the axial skeleton, characterized by their locally invasive and slow but aggressive growth. These neoplasms are presumed to be derived from notochordal remnants with a molecular alteration preceding their malignant transformation. As these tumors are most frequently observed on the skull base and sacrum, patients suffering from a chordoma present with debilitating neurological disease, and have an overall 5-year survival rate of 65%. Surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy is the first-choice treatment modality in these patients, since chordomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Even so, management of chordomas can be challenging, as chordoma patients often present with recurrent disease.

The demonstration of gains of copy number of both T (brachyury homologue) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) genes in chordoma, as well as of their role in promoting cell proliferation, offers a strong preclinical rationale for exploring the inhibition of their products as a credible therapeutic strategy. When dealing with rare cancers, clinical trials based on a frequency-based statistical methodology are hardly feasible. To override the limitations of rarity, the clinical community is suggesting the adoption of a Bayesian methodology.

      <str>The mouse Brachyury (T) gene plays critical roles in the genesis of normal mesoderm during gastrulation and in the maintenance of a functioning notochord. Abrogation of Brachyury (T) expression within the chordamesoderm of homozygous null mutants nevertheless spares anterior axis formation. An intriguing possibility to explain the preservation of anterior axis formation in these mutants would be the existence of other genes compensating for the loss of Brachyury. This compensation and the recent demonstration that Brachyury is the prototype for an evolutionarily conserved family, prompted a search for other T-box genes participating in axis formation. The chick Brachyury orthologue and two related chick T-box genes that are expressed at the onset of gastrulation have been isolated. One of these novel genes (Ch-TbxT) becomes restricted to the axial mesoderm lineage and is a potential candidate for complementing or extending Brachyury function in the anterior axis (formation of the head process, prechordal plate). The other gene (Ch-Tbx6L), together with chick T, appears to mark primitive streak progenitors before gastrulation.

      <str>Immortal tumor cell lines are an important model system for cancer research, however, misidentification and cross-contamination of cell lines are a common problem. Seven chordoma cell lines are reported in the literature, but none has been characterized in detail. We analyzed gene expression patterns and genomic copy number variations in five putative chordoma cell lines (U-CH1, CCL3, CCL4, GB60, and CM319). We also created a new chordoma cell line, U-CH2, and provided genotypes for cell lines for identity confirmation. Our analyses revealed that CCL3, CCL4, and GB60 are not chordoma cell lines, and that CM319 is a cancer cell line possibly derived from chordoma, but lacking expression of key chordoma biomarkers. U-CH1 and U-CH2 both have gene expression profiles, copy number aberrations, and morphology consistent with chordoma tumors. These cell lines also harbor genetic changes, such as loss of p16, MTAP, or PTEN, that make them potentially useful models for studying mechanisms of chordoma pathogenesis and for evaluating targeted therapies.</str>

      <str>Intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumor (BNCT) is a lesion postulated to be of notochordal cell origin. BNCT has recently been recognized as a potential precursor of classic chordoma, a rare malignant neoplasm usually presenting in the sacrococcygeal region, skull base, or mobile spine. Extra-axial chordoma is extremely rare, and only 2 cases of pulmonary chordoma have been reported previously. We describe herein 2 cases of hitherto-unreported lung tumors that were diagnosed as BNCT. The patients were a middle-aged asymptomatic man and woman who were each incidentally found to have a 15-mm pulmonary nodule on computed tomography. They underwent surgical resection of the tumors under a diagnosis of probable benign tumor of uncertain nature. Histopathologically, both tumors showed solid sheets of peculiar adipocyte-like univacuolated cells, multivacuolated cells, and less vacuolated cells with small, round nuclei and mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitosis was absent. These features were typical of BNCT. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells in both cases were positive for brachyury, a transcription factor essential for notochordal cell differentiation and for other markers of notochordal cells including cytokeratins, vimentin, and S-100 protein. Postoperatively, extensive radiographic examination of the whole body revealed no evidence of a primary tumor elsewhere, and both patients are alive and well, with no evidence of disease 1 year after surgery. These 2 cases raise the possibility of a new explanation for the histogenesis of extra-axial chordomas: BNCT may be a precursor lesion of not only conventional axial chordoma but also of extra-axial chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare tumors arising from remnants of the notochord. Because of the challenges in achieving a complete resection, the radioresistant nature of these tumors, and the lack of effective chemotherapeutics, the median survival for patients with chordomas is approximately 6 years. Reproducible preclinical model systems that closely mimic the original patient's tumor are essential for the development and evaluation of effective therapeutics. Currently, there are only a few established chordoma cell lines and no primary xenograft model. In this study, the authors aimed to develop a primary chordoma xenograft model.</str>
      <str>The authors implanted independent tumor samples from 2 patients into athymic nude mice. The resulting xenograft line was characterized by histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. The patient's tumor and serial passages of the xenograft were genomically analyzed using a 660,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism array.</str>
      <str>A serially transplantable xenograft was established from one of the 2 patient samples. Histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical staining for S100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen, and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 of the primary patient sample and the xenografts confirmed that the xenografts were identical to the original chordoma obtained from the patient. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis confirmed the presence of brachyury, a recently described marker of chordomas, in the tumor from the patient and each of the xenografts. Genome-wide variation was assessed between the patient's tumor and the xenografts and was found to be more than 99.9% concordant.</str>

      <str>A new phenotype mapping to the t-complex, which is designated Brachyury the Second (T2), is characterized by a slightly shortened tail in heterozygotes and homozygous failure to form an organized notochord with subsequent abnormal development of posterior somites and neural tube. The phenotype of T2 superficially resembles that of Brachyury; however, there are several important differences. Brachyury homozygotes fail to make posterior somites, notochord, floor plate, and a placental connection, resulting in death by 10.5 days of development. In contrast, T2 homozygotes make posterior somites, scattered notochord cells, and floorplate and achieve an allantoic connection. However, despite making a maternal connection, T2 homozygotes cease development at E11.5 and die soon after. We have cloned and analyzed the transgene insertion site, which maps within 100 kb of the Brachyury gene, but does not seem to physically interrupt nor affect transcription from that locus. The existence of a second gene mapping near Brachyury and affecting the same developmental processes was alluded to over 50 years ago and has been debated ever since. An embryological description of T2 is presented, as is a discussion of the implications of a single, larger Brachyury locus versus two closely linked genes coordinately regulating axial development.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing primary malignant neoplasm of the axial skeleton, which arises from the remnants of the notochord. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) are dysregulated in chordoma tissues and crucially involved in chordoma pathogenesis. In the present study, the expression of 11 candidate miRs were analyzed in chordoma tissues and miR-10a and miR-125a were found to be significantly downregulated compared with controls. Notably, the expression of the primary transcripts, pri-miR-125a and pri-miR-10a was unaltered, suggesting that disturbed microRNA expression may be induced by altered pri-miRNA processing. Previous studies have indicated that disturbed adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) expression is able to alter mRNA and miRNA adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) levels associated with cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, the expression of ADAR1 and ADAR2 was analyzed in chordoma tissues. It was found that ADAR1 was significantly overexpressed, which was accompanied by enhanced pre-miR-10a and pri-miR-125a A-to-I editing. These findings suggest that ADAR2 overexpression causes enhanced pre-miR-10a and pri-miR-125a A-to-I editing, which alters mature miR-10a and miR-125a expression and may contribute to chordoma pathogenesis.</str>

      <str>Wnt3a encodes a signal that is expressed in the primitive streak of the gastrulating mouse embryo and is required for paraxial mesoderm development. In its absence cells adopt ectopic neural fates. Embryos lacking the T-box-containing transcription factors, Brachyury or Tbx6, also lack paraxial mesoderm. Here we show that Brachyury is specifically down-regulated in Wnt3a mutants in cells fated to form paraxial mesoderm. Transgenic analysis of the T promoter identifies T (Brachyury) as a direct transcriptional target of the Wnt signaling pathway.

      <str>Sacral chordoma is an aggressive, locally invasive neoplasm, and has a poor prognosis. However, the molecular basis for the clinical behavior remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in sacral chordoma, and explore their roles in the prognosis. PTEN and mTOR were detected immunohistochemically in 40 sacral chordoma tissues and 10 adjacent normal tissues. Correlations between PTEN and mTOR expression and clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test were used to analyze the continuous disease-free survival time (CDFS). The expression of PTEN in sacral chordoma was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissues, while the levels of mTOR expression in sacral chordoma were significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.000, P = 0.030). The positive expression of mTOR appears to correlate with the negative expression of PTEN in sacral chordoma (P = 0.021). PTEN-negative expression and mTOR-positive expression were associated with tumor invasion into the surrounding muscles (P = 0.038, P = 0.014). Log-rank test showed that PTEN-negative and mTOR-positive expressions had an important impact on the patients' CDFS (P = 0.011, P = 0.015). Our results suggest that PTEN and mTOR might play an important role in the local invasiveness of sacral chordoma. PTEN and mTOR might be recognized as important prognostic predictors of recurrence and could be used as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment for sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>Insulin and insulin-like-growth-factor 1 (IGF1) are components of the uterine secretions. As potent growth factors they influence early embryo development. The underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report on the effects of insulin and IGF1 on early gastrulation in rabbit blastocysts. We have studied blastocysts grown in vivo in metabolically healthy rabbits, in rabbits with type 1 diabetes and in vitro in the presence or absence of insulin or IGF1. Embryonic disc morphology and expression of Brachyury, Wnt3a and Wnt4 were analysed by qPCR and IHC. Pre-gastrulated blastocysts (stage 0/1) cultured with insulin or IGF1 showed a significantly higher capacity to form the posterior mesoderm and primitive streak (stage 2 and 3) than blastocysts cultured without growth factors. In gastrulating blastocysts the levels of the mesoderm-specific transcription factor Brachyury and the Wnt signalling molecules Wnt3a and Wnt4 showed a stage-specific expression pattern with Brachyury transcripts increasing from stage 0/1 to 3. Wnt4 protein was found spread over the whole embryoblast. Insulin induced Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury expression in a temporal- and stage-specific pattern. Only blastocysts cultured with insulin reached the Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury expression levels of stage 2 in vivo blastocysts, indicating that insulin is required for Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury expression during gastrulation. Insulin-induced Wnt3a and Wnt4 expression preceded Brachyury. Wnt3a-induced expression could be depleted by MEK1 inhibition (PD98059). Involvement of insulin in embryonic Wnt3a expression was further shown in vivo with Wnt3a expression being notably down regulated in stage 2 blastocysts from rabbits with type 1 diabetes. Blastocysts grown in diabetic rabbits are retarded in development, a finding which supports our current results that insulin is highly likely required for early mesoderm formation in rabbit blastocysts by inducing a distinct spatiotemporal expression profile of Wnt3a, Wnt4 and Brachyury.</str>

      <str>The appearance of the notochord represented a milestone in Deuterostome evolution. The notochord is necessary for the development of the chordate body plan and for the formation of the vertebral column and numerous organs. It is known that the transcription factor Brachyury is required for notochord formation in all chordates, and that it controls transcription of a large number of target genes. However, studies of the structure of the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) through which this control is exerted are complicated in vertebrates by the genomic complexity and the pan-mesodermal expression territory of Brachyury. We used the ascidian Ciona, in which the single-copy Brachyury is notochord-specific and CRMs are easily identifiable, to carry out a systematic characterization of Brachyury-downstream notochord CRMs. We found that Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) controls most of its targets directly, through non-palindromic binding sites that function either synergistically or individually to activate early- and middle-onset genes, respectively, while late-onset target CRMs are controlled indirectly, via transcriptional intermediaries. These results illustrate how a transcriptional regulator can efficiently shape a shallow gene regulatory network into a multi-tiered transcriptional output, and provide insights into the mechanisms that establish temporal read-outs of gene expression in a fast-developing chordate embryo. </str>

      <str>Chordoma is a malignant tumor thought to arise from remnants of the embryonic notochord, with its origin in the bones of the axial skeleton. Surgical resection is the standard treatment, usually in combination with radiation therapy, but neither chemotherapeutic nor targeted therapeutic approaches have demonstrated success. No animal model and only few chordoma cell lines are available for preclinical drug testing, and, although no druggable genetic drivers have been identified, activation of EGFR and downstream AKT-PI3K pathways have been described. Here, we report a zebrafish model of chordoma, based on stable transgene-driven expression of HRASV12 in notochord cells during development. Extensive intra-notochordal tumor formation is evident within days of transgene expression, ultimately leading to larval death. The zebrafish tumors share characteristics of human chordoma as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, which has some demonstrated activity in a chordoma cell line, delays the onset of tumor formation in our zebrafish model, and improves survival of tumor-bearing fish. Consequently, the HRASV12-driven zebrafish model of chordoma could enable high-throughput screening of potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of this refractory cancer. </str>

In order to investigate the characteristics of the appendicularian unresorbed notochord, we isolated a partial genomic clone and a full-length cDNA sequence homologous to the mouse Brachyury (T) gene from the appendicularian Oikopleura longicauda. Brachyury is known to be predominantly expressed in the notochord cells and plays an important role in their differentiation in other chordates. While phylogenetic analysis robustly supports the orthology of the isolated Brachyury gene, the exon-intron organization found in the genomic clone was distinct from that well-conserved among other T-box genes. In addition to a detailed observation of notochord development in living specimens, whole-mount double in situ hybridization was carried out using a Brachyury probe along with a muscle actin probe. The Brachyury transcripts were found in the notochord of the tailbud embryos and persisted into later stages. The present study highlights characteristics of notochord development in the appendicularian. Furthermore, these results provide basic knowledge for comprehensive understanding of the cellular- and molecular-based mechanisms needed to build the characteristic cytoarchitecture of notochord that varies among tunicate species.</str>

      <str>The notochord is a structure present in all chordates and its development requires the transcription of Brachyury. While previous studies have shown that Brachyury is essential for notochord formation in vertebrate embryos, this gene is also expressed during the embryogenesis of nonchordate deuterostomes, hemichordates and echinoderms. Here we report that nonchordate deuterostome Brachyury genes can trigger the differentiation of extra notochord cells when these genes are ectopically expressed in ascidian embryos. The 2.6 kb upstream region of fork head gene (Ci-fkh) of Ciona intestinalis promotes the tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in endoderm, notochord and nerve cord. By taking advantage of this promoter, we misexpressed the Brachyury gene of ascidian (Ci-Bra), cephalochordate amphioxus (Am(Bb)Bra2), hemichordate acorn worm (PfBra), and echinoderm sea urchin (SpBra), in Ciona embryos. The misexpression of not only the chordate Brachyury, but also the nonchordate deuterostome Brachyury, resulted in the transformation of presumptive endodermal cells into notochord cells. This was confirmed by in situ hybridization experiments using four different notochord-specific probes from Ciona that have different temporal expression patterns. RT-PCR analyses indicated that Ci-Bra was not upregulated by the product of Am(Bb)Bra2, PfBra or SpBra. In situ hybridization showed no ectopic expression of Ci-Bra in the manipulated embryos. These results suggest that the introduction of nonchordate deuterostome Brachyury genes into ascidian embryos can trigger the differentiation of notochord cells in ascidian embryos. Evolutionary alteration in the genetic circuitry, especially downstream of this transcription factor, seems critical for the evolution of notochord and chordate body plan.</str>

ES cells specifically respond to Wnt signal as monitored by GFP expression. In GFP-positive ES cells we observe expression of Brachyury.

      <str>Differentiation and malignant transformation of stem cells are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. We analyzed promoter methylation and expression of the stem cell determining genes Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28, NESTIN and ZFP42 depending on the differentiation state in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECC) and somatic tumor cells. Differentiation of MSC into osteoblasts and adipocytes was accompanied with a loss of expression of the Brachyury gene and downregulation of LIN28. Inactivation of Brachyury was associated with progressive methylation of its CpG island promoter. In ECC promoter methylation of stem cell markers was more frequent in the differentiated subgroup (71%) compared to undifferentiated ECC (29%) and this was associated with downregulation of Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42. DPPA5 was methylated and NESTIN was unmethylated in most tumor cells. In somatic tumor cells, methylation of stem cell markers (Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42) was frequently observed (85%). Treatment of cell lines with an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase reactivated the expression of DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42, indicating that aberrant promoter methylation is a crucial event that results in their silencing. Our results suggest that epigenetic inactivation of stem cell associated genes is mediated by promoter methylation and that this may represent a fundamental mechanism during normal differentiation processes.</str>

This particular high risk group cannot be identified properly as no marker exists to identify these patients. As the Wnt/Win pathway plays a crucial role in metastasis formation in colorectal carcinoma, we analysed whether the transcription factor brachyury critically involved in this pathway may predict metastasis formation in these patients. The expression of brachyury-homologous (T) was immunohistochemically analysed in 748 patients and the data were correlated with classical and newer prognostic markers in colorectal cancer. Early stages colorectal cancer patients (T1-2N0M0, Dukes A) showed a significantly decreased survival when brachyury was expressed in the tumour tissue while no correlation was observed in later tumour stages. Hence a subset of colorectal cancers exists in which the ability to metastasise is already present at early stages of tumour growth and this high risk group can now be detected by immunohistochemistry.</str>

      <str>An experimental study to investigate the activation of Src/Stat3 pathways in chordomas and blockage of this pathway as a potential strategy for chordoma treatment.</str>
      <str>To investigate the activation of Src/Stat3 pathway in chordomas cells and to determine the efficiency of inhibiting this pathway by 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid-methyl ester (CDDO-Me) as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for chordoma treatment.</str>
      <str>The advent of molecularly targeted therapies has raised interest for their use in the treatment of chordomas. Unfortunately, the current understanding of molecular markers in chordomas is limited. Constitutive activation of Stat3 is a common finding in a wide spectrum of human cancers. The function of Stat3 pathway in chordomas has not been elucidated.</str>
      <str>The expression of key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade was evaluated by Western blot in chordoma tissues and chordoma cell lines. The effects of CDDO-Me on chordoma cell growth were evaluated in these chordoma cell lines by MTT assay. The expression of key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in these CDDO-Me treated cells were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of CDDO-Me on cisplatin and doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT. Finally, chordoma cells were grown in a 3-dimensional (3D) culture and treated with CDDO-Me.</str>
      <str>The key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade, including Stat3, pStat3, Src, pSrc, Bcl-xL, and Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1, were all highly expressed in chordomas. Expression of the key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade was inhibited in chordoma cells after treatment with CDDO-Me. The growth of chordoma cells was inhibited and apoptosis associated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was detected after treatment with CDDO-Me. Additionally, CDDO-Me has a synergistic effect on cisplatin or doxorubicin-induced chordoma cell death (P &lt; 0.001). Finally, expression of pSrc and pStat3 and chordoma cell growth was inhibited by treatment of CDDO-Me using 3D culture.</str>
      <str>The Src/Stat3 signaling pathway was activated in chordomas. Blockage of Src/Stat3 pathway by CDDO-Me is a potential strategy for chordoma treatment and may be focus for future research.</str>

      <str>A major obstacle in the effective treatment of chordoma is that there are no identifiable biomarkers capable of predicting prognosis. Recent research has indicated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat3) may be an important prognostic marker in some cancers, but its role in chordoma tumors has not been elucidated. In this study, the expression of Stat3 was evaluated in chordoma tissue microarray that contains 70 chordoma samples. Cells in the tissue microarray showed nuclear staining for phosphorylated Stat3 in all instances. The level of phosphorylated Stat3 expression correlated with the survival and severity of the disease. Three chordoma cell lines were exposed to SD-1029, a novel inhibitor of Stat3 activation. MTT assay showed that the growth of all chordoma cell lines was inhibited by SD-1029. The expression of Stat3 signaling cascade was inhibited in all chordoma cell lines after treatment with SD-1029. The cytotoxicity of the combination of SD-1029 and chemotherapeutic drugs is significantly better than either agent alone. Phosphorylation of Stat3 in chordoma cells in vitro and cellular proliferation in three-dimensional culture were inhibited by SD-1029. In conclusion, the Stat3 pathway is constitutively activated in chordomas and the level of expression may serve as a predictor for prognosis. Blockade of the Stat3 pathway represents a potential strategy for future treatment.</str>

      <str>The prevalent model for the generation of axial polarity in mouse embryos proposes that a radial to a linear transition in the expression of primitive streak markers precedes the formation of the primitive streak on one side of the epiblast. This model contrasts with the models of mesoderm formation in other vertebrates as it suggests that the primitive streak is initially established in a radial pattern rather than a localized region of the epiblast. Here, we examine the proposed correlation between the expression of Brachyury and Wnt3, two genes reported as expressed radially in the proximal epiblast, with the movements of proximal anterior epiblast cells at stages leading to the formation of the primitive streak. Our results reveal that neither Brachyury nor Wnt3 forms a ring of expression in the proximal epiblast as previously thought. In embryos dissected between 5.5 and 6.5 dpc, Brachyury is first expressed in the distal extra-embryonic ectoderm and subsequently on one side of the epiblast. Wnt3 expression is evident first in the posterior visceral endoderm of 5.5 dpc embryos and later in the posterior epiblast. Lineage analysis shows that the movements of the proximal epiblast do not restrict Brachyury expression to the posterior epiblast. Our data suggest a model whereby the localized expression of these genes in the posterior epiblast, and hence the formation of the primitive streak, is the result of local cell-cell interactions in the future posterior portion of the egg cylinder rather than regionalization of a radial pattern of expression in proximal epiblast cells.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a well-known bone tumor that shows epithelioid features and in which the expression of cytokeratins (CKs) has been reported to appear very frequently. Numerous immunohistochemical analyses of CK expression have been conducted using such monoclonal antibodies as CAM5.2, which react with CK8, CK18, and CK19, and AE1/AE3, which react with CKs 1-8, 10, 14-16 and 19 in chordoma. No detailed analysis, however, of the expression of each component of CK has yet been conducted in chordoma; thus, the subsets of CK expressed there have yet to be clarified. With the use of immunohistochemical techniques with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against each subset of CK, the authors studied the expression of CKs in 16 specimens of classic chordoma and 14 specimens of the fetal notochord to clarify the subsets of CK expressed in chordoma and to evaluate the similarities and differences of CK expression between chordoma and the fetal notochord. All of the chordoma specimens showed a strong positive immunoreactivity for CK8 and CK19, whereas nine (56.3%) chordoma specimens showed a positive immunoreaction for CK18. In addition, four chordoma specimens were focally positive for keratin-903, which reacts with high molecular weight CKs such as CK1, CK5, CK10, and CK14; one specimen also showed a strong CK7 expression. All of the notochord specimens were also positive for CK8 and CK19, but none showed a positive immunoreaction for keratin-903, CK7, or CK18. In addition, none of the chordoma or notochord specimens showed immunoreactivity for CK20. The expression of CK8 and CK19, observed in all of the chordoma and notochord specimens, was thus considered to be maintained throughout the neoplastic transformation, although some aberrant CK expressions (CK7, CK18, and keratin-903) also occurred in the chordoma specimens examined in this study.</str>

      <str>Identification of tumor antigens is essential in advancing immune-based therapeutic interventions in cancer. Particularly attractive targets are those molecules that are selectively expressed by malignant cells and that are also essential for tumor progression.</str>
      <str>We have used a computer-based differential display analysis tool for mining of expressed sequence tag clusters in the human Unigene database and identified Brachyury as a novel tumor antigen. Brachyury, a member of the T-box transcription factor family, is a key player in mesoderm specification during embryonic development. Moreover, transcription factors that control mesoderm have been implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been postulated to be a key step during tumor progression to metastasis. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis validated the in silico predictions and showed Brachyury expression in tumors of the small intestine, stomach, kidney, bladder, uterus, ovary, and testis, as well as in cell lines derived from lung, colon, and prostate carcinomas, but not in the vast majority of the normal tissues tested. An HLA-A0201 epitope of human Brachyury was identified that was able to expand T lymphocytes from blood of cancer patients and normal donors with the ability to lyse Brachyury-expressing tumor cells.</str>

      <str>Chordoid meningioma, World Health Organization grade II, is an uncommon variant of meningioma with a propensity for aggressive behavior and increased likelihood of recurrence. As such, recognition of this entity is important in cases that show similar morphologic overlap with other chondroid/myxoid neoplasms that can arise within or near the central nervous system. A formal comparison of the immunohistochemical features of chordoid meningioma versus tumors with significant histologic overlap has not been previously reported. In this study, immunohistochemical staining was performed with antibodies against D2-40, S100, pankeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), brachyury, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 4 cases of chordoid glioma, 6 skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, 10 chordoid meningiomas, 16 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, 18 chordomas, 22 low-grade chondrosarcomas, and 27 enchondromas. Staining extent and intensity were evaluated semiquantitatively and mean values for each parameter were calculated. Immunostaining with D2-40 showed positivity in 100% of skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, 96% of enchondromas, 95% of low-grade chondrosarcomas, 80% of chordoid meningiomas, and 75% of chordoid gliomas. Staining with S100 demonstrated diffuse, strong positivity in all (100%) chordoid gliomas, skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and enchondromas, 94% of chordomas, and 81% of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, with focal, moderate staining in 40% of chordoid meningiomas. Pankeratin highlighted 100% of chordoid gliomas and chordomas, 38% of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, and 20% of chordoid meningiomas. EMA staining was positive in 100% of chordoid gliomas, 94% of chordomas, 90% of chordoid meningiomas, and 25% of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. Brachyury was positive only in the chordomas (100%), whereas GFAP was positive only in the chordoid gliomas (100%). EMA was the most effective antibody for differentiating chordoid meningioma from skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, low-grade chondrosarcoma, and enchondroma, whereas D2-40 was the most effective antibody for differentiating chordoid meningioma from extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and chordoma. Our findings demonstrate that in conjunction with clinical and radiographic findings, immunohistochemical evaluation with a panel of D2-40, EMA, brachyury, and GFAP is most useful in distinguishing chordoid meningioma from chordoid glioma, skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, chordoma, low-grade chondrosarcoma, and enchondroma. A lack of strong, diffuse S100 reactivity may also be useful in excluding chordoid meningioma. Among the neoplasms evaluated, brachyury and GFAP proved to be both sensitive and specific markers for chordoma and chordoid glioma, respectively. Of note, this study is the first to characterize the D2-40 immunoprofile in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, results that could be of utility in differential diagnostic assessment.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant tumors that originate from the notochord remnants and occur in the skull base, spine and sacrum. Due to a very limited understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of chordoma, there are no adjuvant and molecular therapies besides surgical resection and radiation therapy. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNA molecules with critical roles in cancer. The role of miRNAs in chordomas is mostly unknown. We uncover microRNA-608 (miR-608) and microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as novel tumor suppressive microRNAs that regulate malignancy in chordoma. We find that miR-608 and miR-34a expressions are downregulated in human chordoma cell lines and primary cells at least partially via alteration of their genes' copy numbers. We identify the commonly deregulated oncogenes EGFR and Bcl-xL as direct targets of miR-608 and the receptor tyrosine kinase MET as direct target of miR-34a. We show that EGFR and MET activations promote chordoma cell proliferation and invasion and that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and MET inhibits chordoma cell proliferation and survival. We demonstrate that restoration of miR-608 and miR-34a inhibits cell proliferation and invasion and induces apoptosis in chordoma cells. We find that miR-34a inversely correlates with MET expression and miR-608 inversely correlates with EGFR expression in chordoma cells. These findings demonstrate for the first time that miR-608 and miR-34a regulate chordoma malignancy by regulating EGFR, MET and Bcl-xL. </str>

      <str>More than 550 million years ago, chordates originated from a common ancestor shared with nonchordate deuterostomes by developing a novel type of larva, the "tadpole larva." The notochord is the supporting organ of the larval tail and the most prominent feature of chordates; indeed, phylum Chordata is named after this organ. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the notochord over the course of chordate evolution with a special emphasis on a member of T-box gene family, Brachyury. Comparison of the decoded genome of a unicellular choanoflagellate with the genomes of sponge and cnidarians suggests that T-box gene family arose at the time of the evolution of multicellular animals. Gastrulation is a morphogenetic movement that is essential for the formation of two- or three-germ-layered embryos. Brachyury is transiently expressed in the blastopore (bp) region, where it confers on cells the ability to undergo invagination. This process is involved in the formation of the archenteron in all metazoans. This is a "primary" function of Brachyury. During the evolution of chordates, Brachyury gained an additional expression domain at the dorsal midline region of the bp. In this new expression domain, Brachyury served its "secondary" function, recruiting another set of target genes to form a dorsal axial organ, notochord. The Wnt/β-catenin, BMP/Nodal, and FGF-signaling pathways are involved in the transcriptional activation of Brachyury. We discuss the molecular mechanisms of Brachyury secondary function in the context of the dorsal-ventral (D-V) inversion theory and the aboral-dorsalization hypothesis. Although the scope of this review requires some degree of oversimplification of Brachyury function, it is beneficial to facilitate studies on the notochord formation, a central evolutionary developmental biology problem in the history of metazoan evolution, pointed out first by Alexander Kowalevsky.</str>

      <str>The homeobox gene goosecoid, originally identified in Xenopus, is expressed in the organizer or its equivalent during gastrulation in the frog, chick, zebrafish and mouse. To investigate the role of goosecoid in mouse development, we have generated embryonic stem cells that stably overexpress the murine homolog of goosecoid. These cells show a repression of the gastrulation-associated gene Brachyury. Interestingly, repression of Brachyury is conserved between Xenopus and mouse despite the lack of conservation of the Brachyury promoter. Further characterization of the goosecoid-overexpressing ES cells revealed that they maintain the expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, and teratomas derived from goosecoid-overexpressing cells show the presence of cell types derived from all three germ layers. Some highly chimeric mice derived from goosecoid-overexpressing cells displayed skull defects. These observations suggest that goosecoid may play a role in specification of anterior mesendodermal fates and specifically in mouse craniofacial development.</str>

Brachyury-transformed mesenchymal progenitor cells were implanted alone or combined with RASFs isolated from diseased human joints in each of six immunodeficient SCID mice. De novo tissue formation was analysed by histology and immunohistochemistry after 60 days. Spheroid nodules resembling cartilage morphologically and by the expression of proteoglycans and collagen II developed in four of six implants in the absence and in five of six implants in the presence of RASFs. No evidence for hypertrophic differentiation could be observed. Mesenchymal progenitor cells transformed with Brachyury are able to produce a cartilage like tissue in vivo over an extended period of time that is resistant to the destructive effect of RASF. This observation may provide opportunities for a cell-based reconstructive treatment in joint disease.</str>

      <str>Expression of the transcription factor genes brachyury, Tbx2/3 and sall is characterized in detail for the first time in an indirectly developing spiralian with a feeding trochophore. In Hydroides elegans, gut formation proceeds by invagination during embryogenesis and is followed by feeding-dependent posterior growth during larval stages. Posterior growth gives rise to the reproductive and segmented portion of the adult and derives primarily from multipotent dorsal blastomeres. Dorsal fate becomes morphologically evident at the 60-cell stage during spiral cleavage, although the timing of dorsal specification remains uncertain. Expression of brachyury anticipates the morphogenetic events associated with both gastrulation by invagination in the endoderm and ventral midline convergent extension in the ectoderm. The absence of brachyury expression in endoderm precursors previously reported in annelids that do not have feeding larvae suggests evolutionarily conserved roles associated with morphogenesis rather than endoderm specification. Synexpression of brachyury and FoxA in the blastopore of eumetazoans as well as in the secondarily formed anus of some protostomes and the mouth of deuterostomes suggests shared regulatory circuits during the formation of both oral and anal openings in protostomes and deuterostomes. Expression of sall during gastrulation, in the protonephridium, and in posterior growth zone precursors, also suggests evolutionarily conserved roles. The dorsal sides of the Hydroides and sea urchin embryos express Tbx2/3 in all three germ layer precursors, suggesting evolutionarily conserved dorsal regionalization functions. The results suggest specific gene usage during tubular gut formation, endoderm specification, dorsoventral specification and anteroposterior body elongation in the context of development by feeding larva.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor gene Brachyury is important for the differentiation of notochord in all chordates, including the ascidians Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis. We isolated Brachyury from molgulid ascidians, which have evolved tailless larvae multiple times independently, and found the genes appear functional by cDNA sequence analyses. We then compared the expression of Mocu-Bra in tailed Molgula oculata embryos to two tailless species, Molgula occulta (Mocc-Bra) and Molgula tectiformis (Mt-Bra). Here we show that both tailless species express Brachyury in the notochord lineage during embryogenesis. Initial expression of Mocu-Bra is normal in tailed M. oculata embryos; 10 precursor notochord cells divide twice to result in 40 notochord cells that converge and extend to make a notochord down the center of the tail. In contrast, in tailless Molgula occulta, Mocc-Bra expression disappears prematurely, and there is only one round of division, resulting in 20 cells in the final notochord lineage that never converge or extend. In M. occulta x M. oculata hybrid embryos, expression of Mocu-Bra is prolonged, and the embryos form a tail with 20 notochord cells that converge and extend normally. However, in Molgula tectiformis, a different tailless ascidian, Mt-Bra was expressed only in the 10 notochord precursor cells, which never divide, converge, or extend. In summary, neither Brachyury function nor the early establishment of the notochord lineage appears to be impaired in tailless embryos. In light of these results, we are continuing to investigate how and why notochord development is lost in tailless molgulid ascidian embryos.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a member of the T-box gene family, is required for posterior mesoderm and notochord differentiation in vertebrate development, and mis-expression of Xenopus Brachyury causes ectopic mesoderm formation. Brachyury is a transcription activator, and its ability to activate transcription is essential for its biological function, but Brachyury target genes have proved difficult to identify. Here we employ a hormone-inducible Brachyury construct and subtractive hybridization to search for such targets. Using this approach we have isolated Bix1, a homeobox gene expressed both in the marginal zone of Xenopus and in the vegetal hemisphere. Expression of Bix1 is induced in an immediate-early fashion by mesoderm-inducing factors such as activin as well as by the products of the T-box genes Xbra and VegT (also known as Antipodean, Brat and Xombi). Activation of Bix1 in response to Xbra is direct in the sense that it does not require protein synthesis, and both Xbra and VegT activate expression of a reporter gene driven by the Bix 5' regulatory region, which contains an Xbra/VegT binding site. Mis-expression of low levels of Bix1 causes formation of ventral mesoderm, while high levels induce endodermal differentiation. These results suggest that Bix1 acts downstream of both VegT and Xbra to induce formation of mesoderm and endoderm.</str>

      <str>mESCs were differentiated into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes that were visible in embryoid bodies (EBs) on d 7. On d 12-14, all EBs developed spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes.

Brachyury(+) cells showed higher expression levels of Jmjd3, Jmjd2a and Jhdm1d than Brachyury(-) cells. A higher level of Jmjd3 was detected in Flk-1(+)/Cxcr4(+) cells, whereas the level of Jmjd2c was lower in both Brachyury(+) cells and Flk-1(+)/Cxcr4(+) cells.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury family of T-domain containing transcription factor has been recently the subject of a number of Evo-Devo studies, with expression data obtained from a wide sampling of eumetazans, pointing to a possible conserved role in the formation of the blastopore and the extremities of the digestive tract. Here we present a comparative analysis of Brachyury sequences at the metazoan scale, using published data and two new sponge Brachyury sequences. Alignment features, gene phylogeny, and the evolution of variable positions within the T-domain are discussed in the light of available data about functional constraints on the residues. Interestingly, the high sequence divergence observed in Brachyury T-domains from sponges appears to be mostly the consequence of autapomorphic changes within the sponge lineages, rather than the retention of primitive character states.</str>

      <str>Reverse transcription-PCR and Northern and Western blot analyses indicate that mRNA and protein encoded by the Brachyury gene are expressed by the pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTERA2 and are only modestly down-regulated during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. This differentiation occurs along a neural lineage, with no obvious evidence of the formation of mesodermal derivatives. Several other human embryonal carcinoma cell lines that do not differentiate, a yolk sac carcinoma cell line and two choriocarcinoma cell lines, also express readily detectable levels of Brachyury mRNA and protein. Thus, in human teratocarcinomas, Brachyury expression is not necessarily an indicator of commitment to mesodermal differentiation.</str>

      <str>Immunohistochemistry and in situ apoptosis detection assay were performed on chordoma and notochordal cells.</str>
      <str>To investigate the expression levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its 2 receptors, tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and p75, as well as proliferation potential and apoptosis indexes in chordoma and notochordal cells.</str>
      <str>Chordomas arise from primitive notochordal remnants. Why these notochordal remnants undergo malignant transformation to chordoma remains unknown. The binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor promotes cell survival, while its binding to the p75 receptor triggers apoptosis. If there is simultaneous expression of both receptors, the effect of TrkA supersedes and the cells survive.</str>
      <str>We examined 10 surgically obtained sacral chordoma tissue samples to determine the expressions of NGF and TrkA and p75 receptors as well as markers of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. As controls, we used notochordal cells of L4-L5 discs obtained from ten 1-month old rats. We quantified the expressions of NGF and TrkA and p75 receptors as well as markers of cellular proliferation and apoptosis for both groups, respectively.</str>
      <str>Chordoma and notochordal cells both expressed NGF as well as TrkA and p75 receptors. While the mean percentage of p75 receptor expression was very similar between chordoma and notochordal cells (P = 0.394), the mean percentages of TrkA and NGF expressions were significantly higher in chordoma cells than in notochordal cells (both P = 0.002). The mean proliferation potential index of chordoma cells was significantly higher than in notochordal cells (P &lt; 0.01). Conversely, the mean apoptosis index of chordoma cells was significantly lower compared with that of notochordal cells (P = 0.03).</str>
      <str>The current results suggest that increased expressions of NGF and TrkA receptor in chordoma cells might be a possible mechanism of malignant transformation of notochordal remnants to chordoma by negating apoptotic signal of p75 receptor.</str>

      <str>Members of the LEF-1/TCF family of transcription factors have been implicated in mediating a nuclear response to Wnt signals by association with beta-catenin. Consistent with this view, mice carrying mutations in either the Wnt3a gene or in both transcription factor genes Lef1 and Tcf1 were previously found to show a similar defect in the formation of paraxial mesoderm in the gastrulating mouse embryo. In addition, mutations in the Brachyury gene, a direct transcriptional target of LEF-1, were shown to result in mesodermal defects. However, direct evidence for the role of LEF-1 and Brachyury in Wnt3a signaling has been limiting. In this study, we genetically examine the function of LEF-1 in the regulation of Brachyury expression and in signaling by Wnt3a. Analysis of the expression of Brachyury in Lef1(-/-)Tcf1(-/-) mice and studies of Brachyury:lacZ transgenes containing wild type or mutated LEF-1 binding sites indicate that Lef1 is dispensable for the initiation, but is required for the maintenance of Brachyury expression. We also show that the expression of an activated form of LEF-1, containing the beta-catenin activation domain fused to the amino terminus of LEF-1, can rescue a Wnt3a mutation. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that Lef1 mediates the Wnt3a signal and regulates the stable maintenance of Brachyury expression during gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a relatively rare malignant bone tumor thought to arise from the remnants of the fetal notochord. Chordomas express epithelial cell markers such as cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), which strongly suggests that the tumor cells grow via the mechanism of epithelial characterized cell-cell interactions. However, there are no known reports that have studied epithelial characterized cell-adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) in chordomas. An immunohistochemical investigation was performed in seven cases of chordoma to determine the expression of pan-cytokeratin, Ep-CAM, and E-cadherin. Histological specimens showed the typical appearance of conventional chordoma but for two cases of chondroid chordoma. Cytokeratin was constantly expressed in conventional chordomas, but it was detected among a few cells with physaliphorous appearance in chondroid chordoma cases. Although no Ep-CAM expression was noted, E-cadherin was detected in most chordoma cells irrespective of histological subtypes. The expression of E-cadherin was negative among chondrosarcoma cells in this study as previously reported, and thus constant E-cadherin expression of chordoma cells suggests a role as a useful diagnostic marker to distinguish chondroid chordoma from chondrosarcoma. Furthermore, we speculate that E-cadherin may play a role in tumor cell adhesion and is also involved with histological and clinical features in chordomas.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare and low-malignant neoplasm which is considered to arise from notochord remnants. Due to its large resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical resection so far is the prior treatment for chordoma. However, the recurrence rate is high even after complete surgical resection. Recently, targeted cancer therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in several other tumors, while the related research on chordoma is rare. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway is acknowledged to participate in tumor development, in which Raf-1 and extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) play vital roles. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 by immunohistochemical staining in 42 chordoma tissue and 16 distant normal tissue. Moreover, we also investigated the correlations of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 expression with clinical features in sacral chordoma. Expression of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 was both significantly higher in sacral chordoma tissue than distant normal tissue (P = 0.008, P = 0.019). Raf-1 positive expression was related to surrounding muscle invasion (P = 0.032) and chordoma recurrence (P = 0.002), but the results did not indicate any association with patients' age, gender, tumor size and location. ERK1/2 was associated with tumor size (P = 0.044) instead of other clinical factors (P &gt; 0.05). Spearman correlation test showed close relation between ERK1/2 and Raf-1 (P = 0.001, r = 0.518). Kaplan-Meier survival Curve and log-rank test showed that Raf-1 positive expression was associated with shorter continuous disease-free survival time (CDFS) (P = 0.001), while ERK1/2 had no relation to CDFS (P = 0.961). Conclusively, Raf-1 may be an important biomarker in predicting the prognosis of chordoma patients. </str>

      <str>Sacral chordoma is a rare and aggressive tumor, with a high rate of local recurrence even when the tumor is radically resected. The fundamental knowledge of its biological behavior remains unknown. Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is one of the RNA binding proteins and is expressed during embryogenesis and in various malignant tumors. This study evaluated expression of IMP3 in sacral chordoma for association with patient's clinicopathological factors. A total of 32 patients with sacral chordoma (17 male and 15 female) and 10 samples of distant normal tissues were collected for analysis of IMP3 expression using immunohistochemistry. Association between IMP3 expression and clinicopathological factors (such as patient's age, gender, tumor location, tumor size, surrounding muscle invasion, Ki-67 expression, and tumor recurrence) were statistically analyzed. IMP3 was expressed in 20 (62.5%) patients, whereas there was no expression in the 10 distant normal tissues. IMP3 expression was associated with tumor invasion into the surrounding muscle (P = 0.028), high levels of Ki-67 expression (P = 0.009), and tumor recurrence (P = 0.012). The log-rank test revealed that patients with positive IMP3 expression had a shorter continuous disease-free survival time than those with negative IMP3 expression (P = 0.016). IMP3 expression was independent of age, gender, tumor location and tumor size. These results indicate that IMP3 was overexpressed in sacral chordoma and this expression was associated with tumor invasion and recurrence; thus, IMP3 may play an important role in tumor progression and could serve as a prognostic biomarker for sacral chordoma and IMP3 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>Skull base chordomas are invasive tumors, with high rate of local recurrence even when totally extracted. The aggressive biological behavior in chordoma remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between fascin expression and tumor biological behavior in skull base chordoma. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we investigated the expression of fascin in 34 patients with skull base chordomas (19 primary tumors and 20 recurrent tumors). Correlation between fascin expression and clinicopathological factors such as patient's age, sex, tumor locations, and fascin expression in recurrent tumor and in tumor with dura mater erosion was analyzed. Various extent of fascin expression was observed in all tumors. There was a higher fascin expression in recurrent chordoma than in primary chordoma, and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.031). No difference of fascin expression was found between histology types. Interestingly, in 8 tumors where the cranial base dura was eroded, there was a high level of fascin expression (p=0.047). These immunohistochemical findings suggest that fascin expression was correlated with tumor recurrence and high invasiveness, and that fascin overexpression may play an important role in the biologic behavior of skull base chordomas.</str>

      <str>Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is crucial for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, namely the epiblast, embryonic stem, and embryonal carcinoma cells, into mesendoderm. However, downstream events of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that control the formation of mesendoderm are still unclear. In the present study, we used mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as a model, and identified a homeodomain protein Nkx1-2 as a key regulator of mesendoderm formation. In the mouse embryo, Nkx1-2 was expressed in the primitive streak, in which the nascent mesendoderm emerges. In P19 cells, the expression of Nkx1-2 was activated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling independently of Brachyury, an evolutionary conserved early mesendoderm gene. In contrast, the expression of Nkx1-2 was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of Brachyury. Nkx1-2 acted as a transcriptional repressor to mediate the action of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to activate the Brachyury expression. We found Tcf3 as a potential target of gene repression by Nkx1-2, and the down-regulation of Tcf3 was partly required for effective activation of Brachyury by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These results suggest that Nkx1-2 is a critical component of the gene regulatory network that operates downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to regulate the formation of mesendoderm.</str>

      <str>In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Wnt-responsive development-related genes are silenced to maintain pluripotency and their expression is activated during differentiation. Acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases stimulates transcription, whereas deacetylation of histones by HDACs is correlated with transcriptional repression. Although Wnt-mediated gene transcription has been intimately linked to the acetylation or deacetylation of histones, how Wnt signaling regulates this type of histone modification is poorly understood. Here, we report that Smek, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex, plays an important role in histone deacetylation and silencing of the Wnt-responsive gene, brachyury, in ESCs. Smek mediates recruitment of PP4c and HDAC1 to the Tcf/Lef binding site of the brachyury promoter and inhibits brachyury expression in ESCs. Activation of Wnt signaling during differentiation causes disruption of the Smek/PP4c/HDAC1 complex, resulting in an increase in histones H3 and H4 acetylation at the brachyury gene locus. These results suggest that the Smek-containing PP4 complex represses transcription of Wnt-responsive development-related genes through histone deacetylation, and that this complex is essential for ESC pluripotency maintenance.</str>

      <str>The high rates of embryonic mortalities which follow in vitro production of ruminant embryos have emphasized the need for increased knowledge of early development. It is likely that early failures in embryonic development and placenta formation involve abnormal differentiation of mesoderm. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of expression of two T-box genes known to control the gastrulation process, Brachyury and Eomesodermin, by whole-mount in situ hybridization. To allow a more precise comparison of both expression patterns between embryos, we describe a new staging of pre-implanted ovine embryos by gross morphology and histology from pre-gastrulation stages to the beginning of neurulation. In pre-streak embryos primitive mesoderm cells delaminated in between the primitive endoderm and the epiblast. At that stage, no expression of Brachyury or Eomesodermin could be detected in the embryos. Early expression of both T-genes was observed by the early-streak stages in epiblast cells located close to the presumptive posterior pole of the embryos. Later on, during gastrulation both genes followed a pattern of expression similar to the ones described in other mammals. These observations suggest that other genes, which remain to be identified, are responsible for extra-embryonic mesoderm differentiation in ruminant embryos.</str>

      <str>The expression of Brachyury (Bra) during development of Colostethus machalilla was analyzed with a polyclonal antibody. The observed molecular mass of Bra was of 48 kDa, as in Xenopus laevis. During cleavage, low levels of Bra were expressed. In contrast, in the blastula Bra became up-regulated, and Bra protein was present in a wide ring of surface cells. The surface expression of Bra disappeared in the gastrula, and a new ring of Bra-positive nuclei was detected in deep cells around the closing blastopore. The C. machalilla external and internal rings of Bra-positive nuclei apparently mark the prospective mesoderm in the blastula and gastrula, respectively. The two Bra expression rings were dissociated in time in the fairly slow developing embryos of this frog. Brachyury expression in the notochord became visible only after the blastopore closed, in contrast with X. laevis. In addition, Bra expression in the notochord indicated that dorsal convergence and extension occurred after blastopore closure. The C. machalilla Bra-positive notochord was originally exposed on the gastrocoel roof, in agreement with a superficial component of the prospective mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Aberrant expression of the T-box transcription factor brachyury in human carcinomas drives the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a phenotypic modulation that facilitates tumor dissemination and resistance to conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. By generating isogenic cancer cell lines with various levels of brachyury expression, we demonstrate that high levels of brachyury also significantly reduce the susceptibility of cancer cells to lysis by both antigen-specific T cells and natural killer cells. Our results indicated that resistance of brachyury-high tumor cells to immune-mediated attack was due to inefficient caspase-dependent apoptosis, manifested as inefficient nuclear lamin degradation in the presence of activated effector caspases. We correlated this phenomenon with loss of cell-cycle-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which mediates lamin phosphorylation. In support of a causal connection, pretreatment of tumor cells with a specific inhibitor of WEE1, a negative regulator kinase of CDK1, could counter the defective apoptosis of tumor cells expressing high levels of brachyury. Thus, our findings suggested that reconstituting CDK1 activity to threshold levels may be sufficient to restore immunosurveillance of mesenchymal-like cancer cells that have escaped previous immune detection or eradication.</str>

      <str>The appendicularian Oikopleura dioica is a chordate that has a remarkably simple adult body with small cell number. Its transparency, stereotyped cell lineages, short life cycle, and small genome make it a promising new experimental model of chordate developmental biology. However, the functions of its various genes are still poorly understood due to lack of a tool for suppression of gene expression. Here, we applied a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based-RNA interference (RNAi) method in O. dioica. For introducing dsRNA into eggs and embryos, we injected dsRNAs into the ovary. dsRNA, which is specific to EGFP or mCherry mRNA, decreased the exogenous mRNA-derived fluorescence in both eggs and embryos. dsRNA specific to the Brachyury gene of O. dioica, which is a homologous gene of a key notochord transcriptional factor in ascidians, triggered degradation of endogenous Brachyury mRNA and induced malformation or loss of the notochord in the tail. This effect was Brachyury sequence specific, as three dsRNAs covering different sequences produced the same phenotype. The result is in accordance with its expression site and also with the key regulatory function of Brachyury in notochord formation in other chordates. RNAi in O. dioica would be a useful tool for gaining insight into the oogenesis and early developmental processes in chordates.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare and invasive malignant tumor which primarily relies on surgical treatments. Anticipation of its recurrence and patient survival longevity has been a critical issue of the treatments. This retrospective study examined the survivin expression of sacral chordoma in 30 patients undergoing surgery in our hospital from January 2000 to July 2010, and compared it with chordoma recurrence. Survivin expression was 70 % positive in 30 patients. The positive expression of survivin with recurrence was significantly higher than that without recurrence (p = 0.017) and was inversely related to the continuous disease-free survival time (p &lt; 0.001). Survivin expression was associated with recurrence. The correlation suggested that the survivin expression could be used as an independent predictor of recurrence and could be a potential bio-target gene of angiogenesis in sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>Invasive growth of chordoma is accompanied by severe destruction of adjacent bone tissue, a fact that requires high proteolytic activity at the tumor invasion fronts. In this context, cathepsin K is a candidate molecule. It is a protease with high collagenolytic and elastinolytic activity and previously thought to be restricted to osteoclasts and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In this study, 44 cases of chordoma of sphenooccipital localization, and 10 embryo-fetal specimens including chorda dorsalis were studied immunohistochemically for their expression of cathepsin K. In 4 additional snap-frozen chordoma cases, the enzyme expression was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme histochemistry. Ten chondrosarcomas of the skull base served as controls. Various concentrations of cathepsin K mRNA could be seen in all snap-frozen chordoma specimens. The protease was immunohistochemically expressed by the tumor cells. The immunoreactions were accentuated at the tumor invasion fronts. Enzyme histochemistry indicated a strong tumor cell-associated cathepsin K activity in invasive tumor components. In contrast to chordoma, cathepsin K was not significantly expressed in chorda dorsalis and chondrosarcoma of the skull base. In chondrosarcoma, protease expression was limited to osteoclastic cells localized between infiltrative tumor components and regular bone trabeculae. This study shows the significant expression and activity of cathepsin K in chordoma and implicates an important and direct role of this protease in the infiltrative growth of this tumor. This protease expression occurred during neoplastic transformation and did not appear in chorda dorsalis.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for mesoderm formation in the mouse. In this paper we describe the cloning and expression of a Xenopus homolog of Brachyury, Xbra. As with Brachyury in the mouse, Xbra is expressed in presumptive mesodermal cells around the blastopore, and then in the notochord. We show that expression of Xbra occurs as a result of mesoderm induction in Xenopus, both in response to the natural signal and in response to the mesoderm-inducing factors activin A and basic FGF. Expression of Xbra in response to these factors is rapid, and will occur in dispersed cells and in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, indicating that this is an "immediate-early" response to mesoderm induction.</str>

      <str>The T-box genes constitute an evolutionarily conserved family of putative transcription factors which are expressed in discrete domains during embryogenesis, suggesting that they may play roles in inductive interactions. Members have been identified by virtue of their homology to the prototypical T-box gene, T or Brachyury, which is required for mesoderm formation and axial elongation during embryogenesis. We have previously reported the discovery of six new mouse T-box genes, Tbx1-Tbx6, and described the expression patterns of Tbx1-Tbx5 (Bollag et al., 1994; Agulnik et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 1996; Gibson-Brown et al., 1996). We have obtained cDNA clones encoding the full-length Tbx6 protein from screens of gastrulation-stage mouse cDNA libraries and determined the spatial and temporal distribution of Tbx6 transcripts during embryogenesis. The gene codes for a 1.9-kb transcript with an open reading frame coding for a 540-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular weight of 59 kDa. Tbx6 maps to chromosome 7 and does not appear to be linked to any known mutation. Unlike other members of the mouse T-box gene family which are expressed in a wide variety of tissues derived from all germ layers, Tbx6 expression is quite restricted. Tbx6 transcripts are first detected in the gastrulation stage embryo in the primitive streak and newly recruited paraxial mesoderm. Later in development, Tbx6 expression is restricted to presomitic, paraxial mesoderm and to the tail bud, which replaces the streak as the source of mesoderm. Expression in the tail bud persists until 12. 5 days postcoitus. Tbx6 expression thus overlaps that of Brachyury in the primitive streak and tail bud, although Brachyury is expressed earlier in the primitive streak. Brachyury is also expressed in a second domain, the node and notochord, that is not shared with Tbx6. The onset of Tbx6 expression is not affected in homozygous null Brachyury mutant embryos at 7.5 days postcoitus. However, Tbx6 expression is extinguished in mutant embryos as soon as the Brachyury phenotype becomes evident at 8.5 days postcoitus, indicating that the continued expression of Tbx6 is directly or indirectly dependent upon Brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are initiating cells in colorectal cancer (CRC). Colorectal tumours undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like processes at the invasive front, enabling invasion and metastasis, and recent studies have linked this process to the acquisition of stem cell-like properties. It is of fundamental importance to understand the molecular events leading to the establishment of cancer initiating cells and how these mechanisms relate to cellular transitions during tumourigenesis. We use an in vitro system to recapitulate changes in CRC cells at the invasive front (mesenchymal-like cells) and central mass (epithelial-like cells) of tumours. We show that the mesoderm inducer BRACHYURY is expressed in a subpopulation of CRC cells that resemble invasive front mesenchymal-like cells, where it acts to impose characteristics of CSCs in a fully reversible manner, suggesting reversible formation and modulation of such cells. BRACHYURY, itself regulated by the oncogene β-catenin, influences NANOG and other 'stemness' markers including a panel of markers defining CRC-CSC whose presence has been linked to poor patient prognosis. Similar regulation of NANOG through BRACHYURY was observed in other cells lines, suggesting this might be a pathway common to cancer cells undergoing mesenchymal transition. We suggest that BRACHYURY may regulate NANOG in mesenchymal-like CRC cells to impose a 'plastic-state', allowing competence of cells to respond to signals prompting invasion or metastasis.</str>

      <str>Homologues of the T-box gene Brachyury play important roles in mesoderm differentiation and other aspects of early development in all bilaterians. In the diploblast Hydra, the Brachyury homologue HyBra1 acts early in the formation of the hypostome, the location of the organiser in adult Hydra. We now report the isolation and characterisation of a second Brachyury gene, HyBra2. Sequence analysis suggests that HyBra1 and HyBra2 are paralogues, resulting from an ancient lineage-specific gene duplication. We show that both paralogues acquired novel functions, both at the level of their cis-regulation as well as through significant divergence of the coding sequence. Both genes are expressed in the hypostome, but HyBra1 is predominantly endodermal, whereas HyBra2 transcripts are found primarily in the ectoderm. During bud formation, both genes are activated before any sign of evagination, suggesting an early role in head formation. During regeneration, HyBra1 is an immediate-early response gene and is insensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, whereas the onset of expression of HyBra2 is delayed and requires protein synthesis. The functional consequence of HyBra1/2 protein divergence on cell fate decisions was tested in Xenopus. HyBra1 induces mesoderm, like vertebrate Brachyury proteins. By contrast, HyBra2 shows a strong cement-gland and neural-inducing activity. Domain-swapping experiments show that the C-terminal domain of HyBra2 is responsible for this specific phenotype. Our data support the concept of sub- and neofunctionalisation upon gene duplication and show that divergence of cis-regulation and coding sequence in paralogues can lead to dramatic changes in structure and function.</str>

      <str>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has become an important adjunct tool in diagnostic neuro-oncology practice enabling immunophenotypic characterization of tumor cells. There have been several recent publications regarding new IHC markers that are useful for diagnosis of brain tumors. To introduce the latest advances in IHC in this field, we review the features of novel IHC marker antibodies applicable to selected nonglial tumors in the nervous system, based on recently published reports and our own experiences. We discuss (1) aquaporin-1 and alpha-inhibin for hemangioblastoma, (2) beta-catenin for craniopharyngioma, (3) brachyury for chordoma, and (4) INI-1 for hereditary schwannomas. All the markers presented here are used primarily for supporting or confirming the histologic diagnosis, with the exception of (4), which may be of help in identification of inherited forms in schwannomas. As with other surgical pathology practices, the judicious use of a panel of IHC antibodies selected on the basis of the histologic findings is important for an accurate diagnosis of brain tumors. Of note is that IHC results should be always interpreted in the histopathologic context.</str>

      <str>Using the Hawaiian acorn worm, Ptychodera flava, we began molecular studies on the development of hemichordates, a phylum previously unstudied at this level. Here we review results garnered from the examination of a few specific genes selected to help understand the evolution of vertebrate structures. These studies suggest new ideas about the evolution of developmental mechanisms in the deuterostomes. In a seminal observation, we noted an unexpected zone of expression of the Brachyurygene in the early anterior embryonic ectoderm where the mouth will form. Typically, the Brachyury gene is closely linked to development of the notochord and is expressed around the blastopore and in the posterior mesoderm in most animals. This first expression of Brachyury at the blastopore may represent a regulatory program associated with organizing the original animal head and gut opening, as suggested by the expression of Brachyury during hypostome formation in hydra. We believe that the anterior expression of Brachyury in deuterostomes represents the cooption of the program for organizing the original animal gut opening to form the deuterostome mouth. Recent data from the trochophore larva of a polychaete show that an anterior zone of expression of Brachyury is produced in this protostome by splitting of the Brachyury field during the formation of a gut with a mouth and anus by the lateral fusion of the sides of the blastopore. The ability to initiate independently a secondary regulatory program to organize the new mouth leading to an anterior field of Brachyury expression may be a signal event in the evolution of the deuterostomes. We also noted that the P. flava homolog of T-brain/Eomes, a gene closely related by sequence and expression around the blastopore to Brachyury and associated with development of the vertebrate brain, also exhibits early posterior expression around the blastopore and a field of de novo anterior ectoderm expression during later embryogenesis. The tissue in the zone of de novo anterior ectoderm expression of Pf-Tbrain produces the apical organ, a larval neural structure that has been touted as an evolutionary precursor of the chordate dorsal brain. The gene regulatory mechanisms responsible for initiating the anterior zone of de novo expression of T-brain may represent a cooption to specify early neuroectoderm of the regulatory program evolved first to drive anterior Brachyury expression for deuterostome mouth formation. It will be interesting to examine the possibilities that an ability to initiate the de novo anterior expression of the program that includes T-brain may be a key event in the evolution of the developmental mechanisms leading to the chordate dorsal nervous system.</str>

      <str>The epithelioid features seen in chordoma are unique among mesenchymal tumours. However, no detailed analysis regarding cell-cell communication has been conducted in this epithelioid tumour. The aims of this study were to investigate cell-cell communication in chordoma.</str>
      <str>By means of immunohistochemical techniques that incorporated a panel of monoclonal antibodies against cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin, and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), the expression of CAMs was studied in 15 specimens of chordoma and eight specimens of chondrosarcoma.</str>
      <str>Most chordoma specimens showed some positive immunoreactivity for all the CAMs examined. For the various CAMs investigated, between two and five cases showed diffuse immunoreactions, indicating well preserved expression. Well preserved expression of all the CAMs examined was limited to only one case, thus indicating that the expression of CAMs was decreased in most of the chordoma specimens; however, no significant correlation was found between the decreased expression of CAMs and the histological grade of malignancy, cellular growth pattern, or clinical parameters in chordoma. In chondrosarcoma, only a few specimens showed positive immunoreactivity for CAMs and the expression of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin, and NCAM was seen more frequently in the chordoma specimens than in the chondrosarcoma specimens.</str>
      <str>These results suggest that the expression of CAMs is associated with the formation and maintenance of chordoma tissue architecture, just as it is in other epithelial tumours or normal tissue. Immunohistochemistry for CAMs was found to be of diagnostic value for discriminating chordoma from chondrosarcoma, and these markers could be used along with the cytokeratins, which are already used for this purpose.</str>

      <str>By using computational differential display approach we identified a number of UniGene clusters which comprised 90% or more of ESTs from tumor cDNA libraries. One of them was cluster Hs.389457 which corresponds to the human gene Brachyury (T). That encodes a T-box gene family member transcription factor which is pivotal in early embryonal development. To experimentally verify our in silico findings of T expression, PCR was conducted using panels of cDNA from various human normal and tumor tissues. According to our results, Brachynry is expressed in tumors of the digestive tract, testis, ovary, breast, kidney, bladder, lung and brain tunic as well as in lymphomas. Weak amplification signals were picked up from normal tissues of small intestine, spleen and testis. Our results support earlier hypothesis on predominant tumor-related expression of Brachyury gene in adults.</str>

      <str>To provide first insights into the potential role of iNOS expressed by skull base chordoma, which causes brainstem compression in and around Barrington's nucleus, and its effect on the micturition center.</str>
      <str>Urodynamic testing of 22 symptomatic patients was performed. All women and men with skull base chordoma treated in two hospitals in Germany between 1986 and 2007 were studied. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were documented in patients with acute brainstem compression due to local chordoma growth positive for iNOS expression. Brain magnetic resonance (MRI) images of the lesions of the symptomatic patients were performed.</str>
      <str>Of 74 treated patients, 22 (7 women, 15 men) with a median age of 37 years were evaluated with voiding diaries and computer urodynamic investigation. Urodynamic testing of 22 symptomatic patients with positive iNOS expression of skull base chordoma revealed detrusor overactivity in 55 %, low-compliance bladder in 14 %, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in 45 % and uninhibited sphincter relaxation in 27 %. There was a significant correlation between strong iNOS expression (score 3-6) in skull base chordoma and severe urinary symptoms (p = 0.003, Spearman ρ = 0.526).</str>
      <str>The expression of iNOS in skull base chordoma compressing the dorsolateral pons, in and around Barrington's nucleus, may influence the pontine micturition center (PMC) and be responsible for lower urinary tract symptoms.

      <str>Hemangioblastoma (HBL) accounts for up to 2.5% of all intracranial tumors. It may occur as a sporadic entity or as a part of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Patients with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are also at an increased risk of developing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). The distinction of HBL from CCRCC metastatic to the central nervous system (CNS) or from other histologic mimics can be challenging at times when based solely on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. In the present study we evaluated the potential use of the immunohistochemical evaluation of brachyury protein in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. Archival tissues from 22 HBLs, 16 primary CCRCCs, 8 CCRCCs metastatic to the CNS, and 4 angiomatous and 4 clear cell meningiomas were retrieved from our surgical pathology files and submitted to the immunohistochemical procedures against brachyury. Cases showing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining were considered to be positive for brachyury. Positive cytoplasmic staining was evidenced in the stromal cells of 20 of the 22 HBLs. In most cases, &gt;50% of the neoplastic cells were labeled, with strong or moderate intensity of staining. No nuclear or cytoplasmic staining for brachyury was observed in any of the primary renal or metastatic CCRCCs, nor in either of the meningioma types. Thus, brachyury cytoplasmic staining was demonstrated to be highly specific for HBL (specificity, 100%) and represented a sensible (sensitivity, 91%) method, with high positive (100%) and negative (89%) predictive values and high diagnostic accuracy (95%) in the differential diagnosis between HBL and CCRCC metastatic to the CNS or meningioma. On the basis of our findings we propose the use of brachyury as an additional helpful immunohistochemical marker to resolve the differential diagnosis of HBL toward histologic mimics.</str>

      <str>Several T-box genes are considered to play important roles in developing limbs, tails and neural retinae. Five novel T-box genes in the Japanese newt were isolated and their expression was analyzed, together with another T-box gene of brachyury, during embryogenesis and in the developing and regenerating limbs and tail. Four are designated CpTbx2, CpTbx3, CpTbx6R and CpEomesodermin based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, and the other is named CpUbiqT from its ubiquitous expression. While all were expressed during embryogenesis, only four of them (CpTbx2, CpTbx3, CpUbiqT and brachyury) were detected in developing limbs and/or tails. Except for brachyury, they were continuously expressed in normal adult appendages and showed elevated expression levels in regenerating limbs, whereas only CpTbx2 showed significant up-regulation in regenerating tails. Compared with orthologous genes in other species, CpTbx2, CpTbx3 and CpEomesodermin showed several notable differences such as an abundance of maternal transcripts of CpEomesodermin, a unique insertion sequence within the T-box domain of CpTbx2, and a lack of visible expression of CpTbx2and CpTbx3 in the apical ectodermal region of developing limbs. In view of the uniqueness of the newt, these results are discussed with respect to the possibility of their involvement in regeneration.</str>

      <str>The notochord is the distinctive characteristic of chordates; however, the knowledge of the complement of transcription factors governing the development of this structure is still incomplete. Here we present the expression patterns of seven transcription factor genes detected in the notochord of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis at various stages of embryonic development. Four of these transcription factors, Fos-a, NFAT5, AFF and Klf15, have not been directly associated with the notochord in previous studies, while the others, including Spalt-like-a, Lmx-like, and STAT5/6-b, display evolutionarily conserved expression in this structure as well as in other domains. We examined the hierarchical relationships between these genes and the transcription factor Brachyury, which is necessary for notochord development in all chordates. We found that Ciona Brachyury regulates the expression of most, although not all, of these genes. These results shed light on the genetic regulatory program underlying notochord formation in Ciona and possibly other chordates.</str>

      <str>Xenopus provides a well-studied model of vertebrate gastrulation, but a central feature, the movement of the mesoderm to the interior of the embryo, has received little attention. Here, we analyze mesoderm involution at the Xenopus dorsal blastopore lip. We show that a phase of rapid involution - peak involution - is intimately linked to an early stage of convergent extension, which involves differential cell migration in the prechordal mesoderm and a new movement of the chordamesoderm, radial convergence. The latter process depends on Xenopus Brachyury, the expression of which at the time of peak involution is controlled by signaling through the ephrin receptor, EphA4, its ligand ephrinB2 and its downstream effector p21-activated kinase. Our findings support a conserved role for Brachyury in blastopore morphogenesis.</str>

      <str>The vertebrate Brachyury (T) gene is transiently expressed in nascent and migrating mesoderm, in the differentiating notochord, and in the tail bud, reflecting its independent functions. In contrast, the expression of an ascidian Brachyury gene (As-T) is restricted to differentiating notochord. The present study revealed that the genome of Halocynthia roretzi contains another T-domain gene (As-T2) which encodes a divergent T-domain protein. The transient expression of As-T2 was detected in the endoderm- and muscle-lineage blastomeres of the early embryo and the transcript was retained by involuting and differentiating muscle cells until it became undetectable by the mid-tailbud stage. In addition, As-T2 was expressed transiently in cells that form the tip of the newly forming tail. Interestingly, the combined pattern of spatial expression of As-T and As-T2 appears to correspond to that of a single vertebrate Brachyury gene.</str>

      <str>In ascidian embryos, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in blastomeres of the notochord lineage and play an essential role in the notochord cell differentiation. The genetic cascade leading to the transcriptional activation of Brachyury in A-line notochord cells of Ciona embryos begins with maternally provided beta-catenin, which is essential for endodermal cell specification. beta-catenin directly activates zygotic expression of a forkhead transcription factor gene, FoxD, at the 16-cell stage, which in turn somehow activates a zinc finger transcription factor gene, ZicL, at the 32-cell stage, and then Brachyury at the 64-cell stage. One of the key questions to be answered is whether ZicL functions as a direct activator of Brachyury transcription, and this was addressed in the present study. A fusion protein was constructed in which a zinc finger domain of Ciona ZicL was connected to the C-terminus of GST. Extensive series of PCR-assisted binding site selection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the most plausible recognition sequence of Ciona ZicL was CCCGCTGTG. We found the elements CACAGCTGG (complementary sequence: CCAGCTGTG) at -123 and CCAGCTGTG at -168 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site of Ci-Bra in a previously identified basal enhancer of this gene. In vitro binding assays indicated that the ZicL fusion protein binds to these elements efficiently. A fusion gene construct in which lacZ was fused with the upstream sequence of Ci-Bra showed the reporter gene expression exclusively in notochord cells when the construct was introduced into fertilized eggs. In contrast, fusion constructs with mutated ZicL-binding-elements failed to show the reporter expression. In addition, suppression of Ci-ZicL abolished the reporter gene expression, while ectopic and/or overexpression of Ci-ZicL resulted in ectopic reporter expression in non-notochord cells. These results provide evidence that ZicL directly activates Brachyury, leading to specification and subsequent differentiation of notochord cells.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant tumor that recapitulates the notochord phenotype and is thought to derive from notochord remnants not correctly regressed during development. Apoptosis is necessary for the proper notochord development in vertebrates, and the apoptotic pathway mediated by Fas and Fasl has been demonstrated to be involved in notochord cells regression. This study was conducted to investigate the expression of FAS/FASL pathway in a cohort of skull base chordomas and to analyze the role of fas/fasl homologs in zebrafish notochord formation. FAS/FASL expression was found to be dysregulated in chordoma leading to inactivation of the downstream Caspases in the samples analyzed. Both fas and fasl were specifically expressed in zebrafish notochord sorted cells. fas and fasl loss-of-function mainly resulted in larvae with notochord multi-cell-layer jumps organization, larger vacuolated notochord cells, defects in the peri-notochordal sheath structure and in vertebral mineralization. Interestingly, we observed the persistent expression of ntla and col2a1a, the zebrafish homologs of the human T gene and COL2A1 respectively, which are specifically up-regulated in chordoma. These results demonstrate for the first time the dysregulation of FAS/FASL in chordoma and their role in notochord formation in the zebrafish model, suggesting their possible implication in chordoma onset.</str>

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta staining was of moderate-to-strong intensity in 20 of 21 cases. In contrast, KIT immunoreactivity was weak and focal in each of the seven positive cases. Total EGFR staining was variable; weak staining for phosphorylated EGFR was detected in nine cases. Phosphorylated isoforms of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt and STAT3, indicative of tyrosine kinase activity, were detected in 86%, 76% and 67% of cases, respectively.</str>

      <str>How does a fertilized egg decode its own genome to eventually develop into a mature animal? Each developing cell must activate a battery of genes in a timely manner and according to the function it will ultimately perform, but how? During development of the notochord--a structure akin to the vertebrate spine--in a simple marine invertebrate, an essential protein called Brachyury binds to specific sites in its target genes. A study just published in PLOS Biology reports that if the target gene contains multiple Brachyury-binding sites it will be activated early in development but if it contains only one site it will be activated later. Genes that contain no binding site can still be activated by Brachyury, but only indirectly by an earlier Brachyury-dependent gene product, so later than the directly activated genes. Thus, this study shows how several genes can interpret the presence of a single factor differently to become active at distinct times in development.</str>

      <str>The brachyury, or T, locus encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the early development of all animals. In the mouse, animals heterozygous for a null mutation at this locus are born with a characteristic short tail. Expressivity of the short tail phenotype is greatly affected by genetic background. As a genetic entry into the identification of genes that interact with the Brachyury locus, we have performed a QTL analysis for modifiers of this phenotype. Surprisingly, we discovered that the major modifiers uncovered all act in a sex-limited manner. We have identified two QTLs--Brm1 on Chr 9 and Brm2 on Chr 15--that act only in female offspring(N2) from female T/+ parents(F1) and are responsible together for most, or all, of the genetic variance in phenotypic expression observed between C57BL/10 and C3H/HeJ animals.</str>

      <str>The notochord is one of the characteristic features of the phylum Chordata. The vertebrate Brachyury gene is known to be essential for the terminal differentiation of chordamesoderm into notochord. In the ascidian, which belongs to the subphylum Urochordata, differentiation of notochord cells is induced at the late phase of the 32-cell stage through cellular interaction with adjacent endoderm cells as well as neighboring notochord cells. The ascidian Brachyury gene (As-T) is expressed exclusively in the notochord-lineage blastomeres, and the timing of gene expression at the 64-cell stage precisely coincides with that of the developmental fate restriction of the blastomeres. In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the inductive events and As-T expression. In the present study, we show that overexpression of As-T by microinjection of the synthesized As-T RNA results in the occurrence, without the induction, of notochord-specific features in the A-line presumptive notochord blastomeres. We also show that overexpression of As-T RNA leads to ectopic expression of notochord-specific features in non-notochord lineages, including those of spinal cord and endoderm. These results strongly suggest that the developmental role of the Brachyury is conserved throughout chordates in notochord formation.</str>

      <str>The formation of the primitive streak is the first visible sign of gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers are formed from a single epithelium during early development. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide a good system for understanding the molecular and cellular events associated with these processes. Previous work, both in embryos and in culture, has shown how converging signals from both nodal/TGFβR and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways specify cells to adopt a primitive-streak-like fate and direct them to undertake an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, many of these approaches have relied on genetic analyses without taking into account the temporal progression of events within single cells. In addition, it is still unclear to what extent events in the embryo are able to be reproduced in culture.</str>
      <str>Here, we combine flow cytometry and a quantitative live single-cell imaging approach to demonstrate how the controlled differentiation of mouse ESCs towards a primitive streak fate in culture results in cells displaying many of the characteristics observed during early mouse development including transient brachyury expression, EMT and increased motility. We also find that the EMT initiates the process, and this is both fuelled and terminated by the action of brachyury, whose expression is dependent on the EMT and β-catenin activity.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are tumors that arise at vertebral bodies and the base of the skull. Although rare in incidence, they are deadly owing to slow growth and a lack of effective therapeutic options. In this study, we addressed the need for chordoma cell systems that can be used to identify therapeutic targets and empower testing of candidate pharmacologic drugs. Eight human chordoma cell lines that we established exhibited cytology, genomics, mRNA, and protein profiles that were characteristic of primary chordomas. Candidate responder profiles were identified through an immunohistochemical analysis of a chordoma tissue bank of 43 patients. Genomic, mRNA, and protein expression analyses confirmed that the new cell systems were highly representative of chordoma tissues. Notably, all cells exhibited a loss of CDKN2A and p16, resulting in universal activation of the CDK4/6 and Rb pathways. Therefore, we investigated the CDK4/6 pathway and responses to the CDK4/6-specific inhibitor palbociclib. In the newly validated system, palbociclib treatment efficiently inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and a drug responder versus nonresponder molecular signature was defined on the basis of immunohistochemical expression of CDK4/6/pRb (S780). Overall, our work offers a valuable new tool for chordoma studies including the development of novel biomarkers and molecular targeting strategies. Cancer Res; 75(18); 3823-31. ©2015 AACR. </str>

      <str>Using these cell lines, we investigated the involvement of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSCs) in AdCC metastasis by real-time RT-PCR for EMT related genes and stem cell markers. Characteristics of CSCs were also analyzed by sphere-forming ability and tumorigenicity. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing of target gene was also performed.</str>
      <str>ACCS-M GFP demonstrated characteristics of EMT and additionally displayed sphere-forming ability and high expression of EMT-related genes (Snail, Twist1, Twist2, Slug, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and 2 [Zeb1 and Zeb2], glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [Gsk3β and transforming growth factor beta 2 [Tgf-β2]), stem cell markers (Nodal, Lefty, Oct-4, Pax6, Rex1, and Nanog), and differentiation markers (sex determining region Y [Sox2], Brachyury, and alpha fetoprotein [Afp]). These observations suggest that ACCS-M GFP shows the characteristics of CSCs and CSCs may be involved in the EMT of AdCC. Surprisingly, shRNA silencing of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (also a differentiation marker) resulted in downregulation of the EMT and stem cell markers. In addition, sphere-forming ability, EMT characteristics, and tumorigenicity were simultaneously lost. Brachyury expression in clinical samples of AdCC was extremely high and closely related to EMT. This finding suggests that regulation of EMT by Brachyury in clinical AdCC may parallel that observed in vitro in this study.</str>

In frogs, the Xenopus Brachyury homologue, Xbra, is required for normal formation of posterior mesoderm. We report the characterisation of a second Brachyury homologue from Xenopus, Xbra3, which has levels of identity with mouse Brachyury similar to those of Xbra. Xbra3 encodes a nuclear protein expressed in mesoderm in a temporal and spatial manner distinct from that observed for Xbra. Xbra3 expression is induced by mesoderm-inducing factors and overexpression of Xbra3 can induce mesoderm formation in animal caps. In contrast to Xbra, Xbra3 is also able to cause the formation of neural tissue in animal caps. Xbra3 overexpression induces both geminin and Xngnr-1, suggesting that Xbra3 can play a role in the earliest stages of neural induction. Xbra3 induces posterior nervous tissue by an FGF-dependent pathway; a complete switch to anterior neural tissue can be effected by the inhibition of FGF signalling. Neither noggin, chordin, follistatin, nor Xnr3 is induced by Xbra3 to an extent different from their induction by Xbra nor is BMP4 expression differentially affected.</str>

      <str>T-box transcription factors are a large family of transcriptional regulators involved in many aspects of embryonic development. In a previous report, we described the isolation and genomic characterization of two T-box genes from the siliceous sponge Suberites domuncula: a Brachyury homologue, Sd-Bra, and a Tbx2 homologue, Sd-Tbx2. Elucidation of the genomic structure of Sd-Bra allowed us to demonstrate the existence of two different isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing. Moreover, we demonstrated that the shorter isoform exists in two different glycosylation states.</str>

Also, the fact that a Brachyury and a Tbx2 homologue exist in S. domuncula suggests that the first divergence from the ancestral Brachyury-like gene might be a Tbx2-like gene and not a Tbrain-like gene as had been previously suggested.</str>

      <str>The BMP2-dependent onset of osteo/chondrogenic differentiation in the acknowledged pluripotent murine mesenchymal stem cell line (C3H10T1/2) is accompanied by the immediate upregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) and a delayed response by FGFR2. Forced expression of FGFR3 in C3H10T1/2 is sufficient for chondrogenic differentiation, indicating an important role for FGF-signaling during the manifestation of the chondrogenic lineage in this cell line. Screening for transcription factors exhibiting a chondrogenic capacity in C3H10T1/2 identified that the T-box containing transcription factor Brachyury is upregulated by FGFR3-mediated signaling. Forced expression of Brachyury in C3H10T1/2 was sufficient for differentiation into the chondrogenic lineage in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into muscle. A dominant-negative variant of Brachyury, consisting of its DNA-binding domain (T-box), interferes with BMP2-mediated cartilage formation. These studies indicate that BMP-initiated FGF-signaling induces a novel type of transcription factor for the onset of chondrogenesis in a mesenchymal stem cell line. A potential role for this T-box factor in skeletogenesis is further delineated from its expression profile in various skeletal elements such as intervertebral disks and the limb bud at late stages (18.5 d.p.c.) of murine embryonic development.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation is an excellent model to study chromatin changes at developmentally regulated loci. Differentiating mouse and human ESCs increase genome-wide acetylation (euchromatic) and tri-methylation (heterochromatic) of lysine 9 on histone H3. The Oct4 locus is euchromatic when expressed in undifferentiated ESCs and heterochromatic after differentiation. Brachyury T, a mesoderm-specific transcription factor, is not yet expressed in undifferentiated cells, where its locus has "bivalent" tri-methyl lysine 4 and lysine 27 modifications. During directed differentiation to pre-cardiac mesoderm, the activated brachyury locus has high levels of tri-methyl lysine 4 (euchromatin), switching to heterochromatin after gene silencing. Thus, ESC differentiation is accompanied by genome-wide commitment to euchromatin or heterochromatin. Undifferentiated hESCs bivalently modify the brachyury locus, activate it to euchromatin during mesoderm induction, and subsequently repress it to heterochromatin, demonstrating, to our knowledge, the first analysis of chromatin dynamics at a locus essential for mesoderm and endoderm differentiation.</str>

      <str>The patient presented with pain in her right neck and soreness in her right shoulder that she had experienced for about 2.5 years that she attributed to a muscle strain. She experienced worsening of her symptoms, which prompted her to seek medical care.

One month after the initial surgery, the patient underwent a second surgery. The C2 and C3 vertebral bodies were completely resected, and a C1-C4 anterior fusion was then carried out. A C5 vertebrectomy and C4-C6 fusion were also performed at this time. The patient then received proton beam radiation to the entire affected area.</str>

      <str>Human metastatic chordoma cells were isolated, and initial in vitro characterization was performed. Biochemical and physiologic changes were observed in response to pH, oxygen, and glucose.</str>
      <str>The extracellular microenvironment directly affects metastatic chordoma cell phenotype in vitro.</str>
      <str>Chordomas are primary bone tumors that usually occur in the spine or skull. Chordomas arise from embryonic notochordal remnants along the axial skeleton, most commonly the sacrum, followed by the base of the skull and the mobile spine. Due to a high degree of resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, chordomas eventually cause death by direct growth or by metastasizing to other organs.</str>
      <str>Extracellular pH, oxygen, and glucose levels in the culture medium were controlled, and cell response was assessed using MTT staining, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, tandem mass spectrometry, TUNEL, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry.</str>
      <str>In this study, we present a new chordoma cell line established from metastatic tissue and novel data characterizing some aspects of chordoma cell phenotype in different conditions in vitro. Chordoma biologic markers were expressed in the new cell line. Alkaline pH dramatically increased intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation, metabolic activity, and albumin accumulation in the cells, while acidic pH caused apoptosis.</str>
      <str>The level of proliferation, apoptosis, and tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as the overall protein expression profile, strongly depended on extracellular media pH and oxygen/glucose levels. Chordoma's preferred extracellular microenvironment in vitro was rather alkaline, with an optimum at pH 8.5, and apoptotic changes were induced at acidic pH. We found that bovine serum albumin was accumulated by chordoma cells from the incubation media, and this accumulation depended on extracellular pH, with the highest accumulation at alkaline pH.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare tumor arising in the sacrum, clivus, or vertebrae. It is often not completely resectable and shows a high incidence of recurrence and progression with shortened patient survival and impaired quality of life. Chemotherapeutic options are limited to investigational therapies at present. Therefore, adjuvant therapy for control of tumor recurrence and progression is of great interest, especially in skull base lesions where complete tumor resection is often not possible because of the proximity of cranial nerves. To understand the extent of genetic instability and associated chromosomal and gene losses or gains in skull base chordoma, we undertook whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis of flash frozen surgical chordoma specimens, 21 from the clivus and 1 from C1 to C2 vertebrae. We confirm the presence of a deletion at 9p involving CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP but at a much lower rate (22%) than previously reported for sacral chordoma. At a similar frequency (21%), we found aneuploidy of chromosome 3. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry demonstrated absent or reduced fragile histidine triad (FHIT) protein expression in 98% of sacral chordomas and 67%of skull base chordomas. Our data suggest that chromosome 3 aneuploidy and epigenetic regulation of FHIT contribute to loss of the FHIT tumor suppressor in chordoma. The finding that FHIT is lost in a majority of chordomas provides new insight into chordoma pathogenesis and points to a potential new therapeutic target for this challenging neoplasm.</str>

      <str>Parachordoma is a rare soft tissue tumor that morphologically resembles chordoma of the axial skeleton but occurs in a peripheral site. A recent study reported immunohistochemical differences between chordoma and parachordoma. While both tumors were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 8/18 (as recognized by the antibody Cam5.2), S100 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), only the chordoma was positive for CK7, CK20, CK 1/5/10/14 (as recognized by the antibody 34betaE12) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). It has since been suggested that tumors indistinguishable from chordoma that involve the periphery should be termed chordoma periphericum and that these tumors are distinct from parachordoma. In the current study, the clinical, radiological, pathological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of a chordoma-like tumor involving the deep soft tissues of the lower leg of a 69-year-old woman are presented. Microscopically, the tumor had a pseudolobulated growth pattern and consisted of sheets, nests and cords of epithelioid cells, some with a physaliferous appearance, separated by abundant myxoid stroma. The tumor cells were positive for CK 8/18, EMA and S100, showed focal staining for CK7, and were negative for CK20, CK 1/5/10/14 and CEA. On the basis of these results a diagnosis of parachordoma was favored. For comparison, an immunohistochemical analysis of five axial chordomas was also performed. The chordomas showed positivity for CK 8/18 (5 of 5 cases), EMA (5 of 5 cases), S100 (5 of 5 cases), CK 1/5/10/14 (1 of 5 cases) and CK7 (1 of 5 cases). Stains for CK20 and CEA were negative in all five chordomas. The results of the present study suggest that the expression of antigens for CK 1/5/10/14, CK7, CK20 and CEA in chordoma might not be as common as what has been previously reported. The results also suggest that parachordoma might not be easily distinguished immunohistochemically from axial chordoma (and therefore also from so-called chordoma periphericum).</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, slow-growing, primary malignant skeletal neoplasms. Chromosome analysis, telomere reduction and telomere activity, DNA microsatellite, and loss of heterozygosity studies have been performed on chordomas; however, the clonality status (monoclonal versus polyclonal proliferation) is unknown. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether sacral chordoma is monoclonal or polyclonal in origin with the use of a polymorphic X-linked gene (AR; alias HUMARA) and X-chromosome inactivation studies. DNA was harvested from tumor and corresponding normal tissue from eight women (37-71 years) with chordoma. Clonality was determined using an X chromosome inactivation protocol and a polymorphic human androgen receptor gene (AR) located on the X chromosome. The procedure required a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and determination of the ratio of active to inactive X chromosomes. Results were informative for seven of the eight women, with two separate X-linked alleles seen for the AR gene in the normal tissue. Expression of AR gene alleles from each of the two X chromosomes was present in the chordoma tumor, indicating a polyclonal proliferation in all seven women. Most solid tumors and skeletal neoplasms are polyclonal in nature. Our study indicates that chordoma is polyclonal in its pattern of proliferation.</str>

      <str>A detailed study of the expression pattern of embryonic fibroblast growth factor (eFGF) during early Xenopus development has been undertaken using whole-mount DIG in situ hybridization. We show that the zygotic expression of eFGF is activated in the mesoderm of the early gastrula and is first visualized as a ring around the blastopore, with significantly higher levels of expression on the dorsal side of the embryo. As gastrulation proceeds, eFGF transcripts become increasingly abundant in the dorsal blastopore lip. In the early neurula eFGF expression can be detected in the extreme posterior of the embryo around the closed blastopore and in the cells of the notochord. This latter result is significant and represents the first report of a Xenopus FGF that is expressed in the notochord. In addition, we show that during gastrula and neurula stages, expression of eFGF closely follows the expression of the Xenopus brachyury (Xbra) gene. During later development eFGF expression is localized to the tail-bud region and a stripe at the mid-brain/hind-brain junction. These data provide further evidence that FGFs play an important role in regulating the expression of brachyury in the developing mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Mutations in the mouse Brachyury (T) gene are characterized by a dominant reduction of tail length and recessive lethality. Two quantitative trait loci, Brachyury-modifier 1 and 2 (Brm1 and Brm2) are defined by alleles that enhance the short-tail Brachyury phenotype. Here we report on a genetic analysis of a visible dominant mutation Abnormal feet and tail (Aft) located in the vicinity of Brm1. Affected animals display kinky tails and syndactyly in the hindlimbs, both likely resulting from a defect in apoptosis. We observed an unusual genetic incompatibility between Aft and certain genetic backgrounds. We show that Aft and T are likely to interact genetically, since some double heterozygotes are tailless. In addition to the tail and hindlimb phenotypes, Aft-bearing mutants display characteristic late-onset skin lesions. We therefore tested for allelism between Aft and a closely linked recessive mutation rough coat (rc) and found that these two mutations are likely nonallelic. Our results provide a valuable resource for the study of mammalian skin development and contribute to the genetic analysis of Brachyury function.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for formation of posterior mesoderm and for axial development in both mouse and zebrafish embryos. In this paper, we first show that the Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, and the zebrafish homologue, no tail (ntl), both function as transcription activators. The activation domains of both proteins map to their carboxy terminal regions, and we note that the activation domain is absent in two zebrafish Brachyury mutations, suggesting that it is required for gene function. A dominant-interfering Xbra construct was generated by replacing the activation domain of Xbra with the repressor domain of the Drosophila engrailed protein. Microinjection of RNA encoding this fusion protein allowed us to generate Xenopus and zebrafish embryos which show striking similarities to genetic mutants in mouse and fish. These results indicate that the function of Brachyury during vertebrate gastrulation is to activate transcription of mesoderm-specific genes. Additional experiments show that Xbra transcription activation is required for regulation of Xbra itself in dorsal, but not ventral, mesoderm. The approach described in this paper, in which the DNA-binding domain of a transcription activator is fused to the engrailed repressor domain, should assist in the analysis of other Xenopus and zebrafish transcription factors.</str>

      <str>The notochord is a defining feature of the chordate body plan. Experiments in ascidian, frog and mouse embryos have shown that co-expression of Brachyury and FoxA class transcription factors is required for notochord development. However, studies on the cis-regulatory sequences mediating the synergistic effects of these transcription factors are complicated by the limited knowledge of notochord genes and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that are directly targeted by both. We have identified an easily testable model for such investigations in a 155-bp notochord-specific CRM from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. This CRM contains functional binding sites for both Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and FoxA (Ci-FoxA-a). By combining point mutation analysis and misexpression experiments, we demonstrate that binding of both transcription factors to this CRM is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription. To gain insights into the cis-regulatory criteria controlling its activity, we investigated the organization of the transcription factor binding sites within the 155-bp CRM. The 155-bp sequence contains two Ci-Bra binding sites with identical core sequences but opposite orientations, only one of which is required for enhancer activity. Changes in both orientation and spacing of these sites substantially affect the activity of the CRM, as clusters of identical sites found in the Ciona genome with different arrangements are unable to activate transcription in notochord cells. This work presents the first evidence of a synergistic interaction between Brachyury and FoxA in the activation of an individual notochord CRM, and highlights the importance of transcription factor binding site arrangement for its function.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare, locally aggressive malignancies that often exhibit an insidious natural history and are difficult to eradicate. Surgery and radiotherapy are the treatment mainstays of chordoma, but the chance of local recurrence remains high. Reports of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression in chordoma suggest that these tumors may respond to kinase inhibitor therapy. Currently, there are no effective chemotherapeutic protocols for chordoma. A tissue microarray containing 74 tumor specimens from primary chordoma patients and 71 from their recurrent tumors for a total of 145 tumor specimens was immunohistochemically analyzed for expression of a number of proteins involved in signal transduction from RTKs. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Met, and CD-34 were detected in 100, 92, 100, and 59 % of cases, respectively. PDGFR-α and c-Met staining was of moderate to strong intensity in all cases. In contrast, total EGFR staining was variable; weak staining was detected in 10 cases. Our results contribute to the understanding of the expression of RTKs in skull base chordomas and support the development of targeted therapies that inhibit RTKs, which may have a synergistic effect for chemotherapy in patients. There were statistically significant correlations between the expression of PDGFR-α, c-Met, and EGFR and disease-free survival. The results nonetheless suggest that chordomas may respond to RTK inhibitors or modulators of other downstream signaling. </str>

      <str>Sacral chordoma is an aggressive bone tumor with a high local recurrence rate. Surgery remains the standard treatment because of its resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, recurrence occurs frequently even after complete surgical resection. Great effort has been invested in discovering novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To date, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in 42 sacral chordoma samples and 16 distant normal tissue specimens by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, we analyzed its association with the clinical factors and patients' prognosis. Of all the chordoma samples, 69 % (29/42) showed high expression of SPHK1, whereas, only 19 % (3/16) of distant normal tissues expressed a high level of SPHK1 (p = 0.001). Chi-square analysis revealed that high expression of SPHK1 was significantly correlated with tumor recurrence (p = 0.019) and invasion into surrounding muscle (p = 0.005), while the data did not indicate any association with patients' gender, age, tumor location and size (p &gt; 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test showed that patients with high expression of SPHK1 possessed shorter continuous disease-free survival time. Conclusively, SPHK1 may become a potential biomarker for sacral chordoma in predicting its recurrence and patients' prognosis.</str>

      <str>Expression of the Brachyury (Ci-Bra) gene of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis is initiated at the 64-cell stage. Gene expression is restricted to notochord precursor cells, and Ci-Bra plays a key role in notochord differentiation. In a previous study, nearly 50 cDNA clones for potential Ci-Bra-downstream genes that are expressed in notochord cells were isolated. The present determination, by whole-mount in situ hybridization, of the temporal expression patterns of 19 notochord-specific and 20 notochord-predominant genes demonstrated that the timings of initiation of the expression of various genes was not identical. The expression of several genes was initiated as early as the gastrula stage. However, the expression of most of the notochord-specific genes commenced at the neural plate stage. Partial nucleotide sequence data of these clones suggest that genes expressed earlier encode potential transcriptional factors and/or nuclear proteins, while those expressed later encode proteins implicated in cell adhesion, signal transduction, regulation of the cytoskeleton, and components of the extracellular matrix. These gene activities may be associated with changes in cell shape and adhesion during the intercalation and extension of the notochord cells.</str>

      <str>Insight regarding mechanisms controlling gene expression in the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) will improve our understanding of the processes regulating spermatogenesis and aid in treating problems associated with male infertility. In the present study, we explored the global gene expression profiles of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-regulated transcription factors Ets (E-twenty-six) variant gene 5 (Etv5); B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 6, member B (Bcl6b); and POU domain, class-3 transcription factor 1 (Pou3f1). We reasoned that these three factors may function as a core set of transcription factors, regulating genes responsible for maintaining the SSC population. Using transient siRNA oligonucleotides to individually target Etv5, Bcl6b, and Pou3f1 within mouse SSC cultures, we examined changes to the global gene expression profiles associated with these transcription factors. Only modest overlaps in the target genes regulated by the three factors were noted, but ETV5 was found to be a critical downstream regulator of GDNF signaling that mediated the expression of several known SSC self-renewal related genes, including Bcl6b and LIM homeobox 1 (Lhx1). Notably, ETV5 was identified as a regulator of Brachyury (T) and CXC chemokine receptor, type 4 (Cxcr4), and we showed that ETV5 binding to the Brachyury (T) gene promoter region is associated with an active state of transcription. Moreover, in vivo transplantation of SSCs following silencing of Brachyury (T) significantly reduced the number of donor cell-derived colonies formed within recipient mouse testes. These results suggest Brachyury is of biological importance and functions as part of GDNF/ETV5 signaling to promote self-renewal of mouse SSCs cultured in vitro.</str>

      <str>Hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that specify positional identities along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis during the development of vertebrate embryos. The earliest Hox expression in vertebrates is during gastrulation, at a position distant from the organiser or its equivalent. However, the mechanism that initiates this early expression is still not clear. Guided by the expression pattern, we identified upstream regulators in Xenopus laevis. The mesodermal transcription factor brachyury (Xbra) controls the early Hox expression domain in the animal-vegetal direction and the secreted growth factor BMP-4 limits it in the organiser/non-organiser direction. The overlap of these two signals, indicated by a Cartesian coordinate system, defines the initial Hox expression domain. We postulate that this system is a general mechanism for the activation of all Hox genes expressed during gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Previous work has demonstrated that two key melanocyte-specific elements termed the MSEu and MSEi play critical roles in the expression of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1) promoter. Both the MSEu and MSEi, located at position -237 and at the initiator, respectively, bind a melanocyte-specific factor termed MSF but are also recognized by a previously uncharacterized repressor, since mutations affecting either of these elements result in strong up-regulation of TRP-1 promoter activity in melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate that repression mediated by the MSEu and MSEi also operates in melanocytes. We also report that both the MSEu and MSEi are recognized by the brachyury-related transcription factor Tbx2, a member of the recently described T-box family, and that Tbx2 is expressed in melanocyte and melanoblast cell lines but not in melanoblast precursor cells. Although Tbx2 and MSF each recognize the TRP-1 MSEu and MSEi motifs, it is binding by Tbx-2, not binding by MSF, that correlates with repression. Several lines of evidence tend to point to the brachyury-related transcription factor Tbx2 as being the repressor of TRP-1 expression: both the MSEu and MSEi bind Tbx2, and mutations in either element that result in derepression of the TRP-1 promoter diminish binding by Tbx2; the TRP-1 promoter, but not the tyrosinase, microphthalmia, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) promoter, is repressed by Tbx2 in cotransfection assays; a high-affinity consensus brachyury/Tbx2-binding site is able to constitutively repress expression of the heterologous IE110 promoter; and a low-affinity brachyury/Tbx2 binding site is able to mediate Tbx2-dependent repression of the G3PDH promoter. Although we cannot rule out the presence of an additional, as yet unidentified factor playing a role in the negative regulation of TRP-1 in vivo, the evidence presented here suggests that Tbx2 most likely is the previously unidentified repressor of TRP-1 expression and as such is likely to represent the first example of transcriptional repression by a T-box family member.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant tumors that are postulated to arise from remnants of the notochord. Currently, the interaction between chordomas and the host immune system is poorly understood. The checkpoint protein, PD-1 is expressed by circulating lymphocytes and is a marker of activation and exhaustion. Its ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273), are expressed on a variety of human cancers; however this pathway has not been previously reported in chordomas. We used flow cytometric and RT-PCR analysis in three established primary and recurrent chordoma cell lines (U-CH1, U-CH2, and JHC7) as well as immunohistochemical analysis of chordoma tissues from 10 patients to identify and localize expression of PD-1 pathway proteins. PD-1 ligands are not constitutively expressed by chordoma cells, but their expression is induced in the setting of pro-inflammatory cytokines in all cell lines examined. In paraffin embedded tissues, we found that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expressed PD-1 in 3/6 cases. We also found that, although chordoma cells did not express significant levels of PD-L1, PD-L1 expression was observed on tumor-infiltrating macrophages and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Our study suggests that PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 are present in the microenvironment of a subset of chordomas analyzed. Future studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of the PD-1 pathway to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of chordomas. </str>

      <str>Caudalization, which is proposed to be one of two functions of the amphibian organizer, initiates posterior pathways of neural development in the dorsalized ectoderm. In the absence of caudalization, dorsalized ectoderm only expresses the most anterior (archencephalic) differentiation. In the presence of caudalization, dorsalized ectorderm develops various levels of posterior neural tissues, depending on the extent of caudalization. A series of induction experiments have shown that caudalization is mediated by convergent extension: cell motility that is based on directed cell intercalation, and is essential for the morphogenesis of posterior axial tissues. During amphibian development, convergent extension is first expressed all-over the mesoderm and, after mesoderm involution, it becomes localized to the posterior mid-dorsal mesoderm, which produces notochord. This expression pattern of specific down regulation of convergent extension is also followed by the expression of the brachyury homolog. Furthermore, mouse brachyury has been implicated in the regulation of tissue elongation on the one hand, and in the control of posterior differentiation on the other. These observations suggest that protein encoded by the brachyury homolog controls the expression of convergent extension in the mesoderm. The idea is fully corroborated by a genetic study of mouse brachyury, which demonstrates that the gene product produces elongation of the posterior embryonic axis. However, there exists evidence for the induction of posterior dorsal mesodermal tissues, if brachyury homolog protein is expressed in the ectoderm. In both cases the brachyury homolog contributes to caudalization. A number of other genes appear to be involved in caudalization. The most important of these is pintavallis, which contains a fork-head DNA binding domain. It is first expressed in the marginal zone. After mesoderm involution, it is present not only in the presumptive notochord, but also in the floor plate. This is in contrast to the brachyury homolog, whose expression is restricted to mesoderm. The morphogenetic effects of exogenous RA on anteroposterior specification during amphibian embryogenesis are reviewed. The agent inhibits archencephalic differentiation and enhances differentiation of deuterencephalic and trunk levels. Thus the effect of exogenous RA on morphogenesis of CNS is very similar to that of caudalization, which is proposed to occur through the normal action of the organizer. According to a detailed analysis of the effect of lithium on morphogenesis induced by the Cynops organizer, lithium has a caudalizing effect closely comparable with that of RA. Furthermore, lithium induces convergent extension in the prechordal plate, which normally does not show cell motility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</str>

      <str>The chick genes, cSox2 and cSox3, are members of a large family of genes that encode transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that these genes are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system during embryonic development. We show that cSox3 is expressed throughout the ectoderm that is competent to form nervous tissue before neural induction. The expression of cSox3 is lost from cells as they undergo gastrulation to form nonectodermal tissues; the transcription factor, Brachyury, appears in cells about to undergo gastrulation a short time before cSox3 transcripts are lost. Therefore, Brachyury expression may act functionally upstream of cSox3 downregulation. cSox3 expression is also lost from non-neuronal ectoderm shortly after the neural plate becomes morphologically apparent. cSox2 expression increases dramatically in the central nervous system as neural ectoderm is established. The appearance of cSox2 in neural ectoderm represents one of the earliest molecular responses to neural induction documented thus far.</str>

      <str>A human sacral chordoma cell line, CCL3, was established and in vitro characterization of c-Met oncoprotein in chordoma cells was performed.</str>
      <str>Determination of whether c-Met plays an important role in chordoma's malignancy.</str>
      <str>Chordomas are malignant life-threatening tumors that arise from the remnants of the notochord. c-Met is an oncoprotein that is expressed by a variety of solid tumors, including chordomas, and HGF is its high affinity ligand. In the present study, we investigated c-Met and HGF expression, localization, and function in human chordoma cells.</str>
      <str>SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, immunofluorescence techniques, and cell migration functional assays were used to asses c-Met and HGF expression, localization, and functional activity.</str>
      <str>Intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced on HGF binding, and an increase in the amount of 50 kDa alpha-chain of c-Met was detected in HGF-stimulated cells. Immunostaining of c-Met and HGF revealed membrane/cytoplasmic localization in nonstimulated cells, and perinuclear colocalization in HGF-stimulated cells. Positive chemotactic and migration activity in response to HGF was also demonstrated.</str>
      <str>Our data supports our hypothesis that the c-Met oncoprotein plays a leading role in the metastatic process in chordomas, and that a c-Met-HGF pair is involved in chordoma malignancy. Taking into consideration the very limited treatment options and an extremely poor prognosis for the chordoma patients, our results are a valuable and promising addition to the current situation in managing chordomas.</str>

      <str>To clarify whether vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are involved in the angiogenesis and recurrence of spinal chordoma tissues and influence the overall survival.</str>
      <str>All patients affected by a spinal chordoma surgically treated between 1986 and 2007 were reviewed. We examined the expression of VEGFR2 and iNOS with immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray containing 120 chordoma samples. Local recurrence and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.</str>
      <str>A series of 40 chordoma patients who underwent surgery for a total of 120 lesions (including 80 recurrent lesions) were identified (sacrum 77.5 %, lumbar spine 17.5 %, cervical/thoracic spine 5 %). Surgical margins were wide in 30 (75 %), marginal in 8 (20 %) and intralesional in 2 (5 %) patients. Median follow-up was 120 months. The 5- and 10-year OS of the entire series of patients was 78.6 and 30 %, respectively. There were five primary chordomas (12.5 %) with moderate and 35 (87.5 %) with strong expression of VEGFR-2. All recurrent spinal chordomas displayed strong expression of VEGFR-2. The expression of iNOS was predominately moderate to high in primary chordomas: There were 15 tumors (37.5 %) with moderate and 25 tumors (62.5 %) with strong expression. All recurrent chordomas displayed strong expression of iNOS.</str>
      <str>The high expression of VEGFR-2 and iNOS affected the OS. The OS at 10 years was only 30 %.</str>

      <str>Chordomas represent rare malignant primary bone tumors most often occurring in the sacral area. These tumors uncommonly involve the skin and often follow a progressive course with multiple recurrences, metastases and eventual death. Reports of cutaneous metastases from chordoma are very rare. The immunohistochemical staining characteristics of these cutaneous metastases with comparison to the primary tumors are similarly rarely addressed in the literature. We report a rare case of incidentally discovered, small, solitary distant cutaneous metastasis of sacral chordoma that developed on the right upper back of a 44-year-old man with a history of multiple completely excised melanomas who had also been previously diagnosed with chordoma involving the sacrum 12 years earlier. We describe its pathologic features with comparison to the primary tumor and briefly review the literature. Immunohistochemically, the cutaneous metastasis and primary tumor both stained positively for pancytokeratin and vimentin, as expected. However, the cutaneous metastasis unexpectedly lacked S100 protein expression, whereas the primary tumor was S100 positive. This phenomenon has only been documented in one other case report. We demonstrate that late, incidentally discovered cutaneous metastasis with unexpected immunohistochemical staining features rarely occur and can present a diagnostic challenge.</str>

      <str>The promoter sequence of Brachyury was analyzed in mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. The sequence up to -267 bp relative to the transcription start site was sufficient to enhance reporter gene expression depending on the mesodermal differentiation of P19 cells. Footprint analysis by nuclear extract showed binding of a GATA protein and SP4 and mutation of their sites reduced reporter gene expression. Gel-retardation assay in the presence of a series of double-stranded DNA fragments as the competitors showed SP1 and Est sites additionally. Deletion of either sites reduced the reporter gene expression, showing that they are cooperative. Depletion of PEA3 (a transcription factor of the Est family) with a specific antibody diminished the retarded bands only for the nuclear extract from differentiated P19 cells. Thus, the PEA3 site supported by SP1, SP4, and GATA sites positively regulates the differentiation-dependent expression of Brachyury in P19 cells.</str>

      <str>We report the characterisation of a Brachyury ortholog (PvuBra) in the marine gastropod Patella vulgata. In this mollusc, the embryo displays an equal cleavage pattern until the 32-cell stage. There, an inductive event takes place that sets up the bilateral symmetry, by specifying one of the four initially equipotent vegetal macromeres as the posterior pole of all subsequent morphogenesis. This macromere, usually designated as 3D, will subsequently act as an organiser. We show that 3D expresses PvuBra as soon as its fate is determined. As reported for another mollusc (J. D. Lambert and L. M. Nagy (2001) Development 128, 45-56), we found that 3D determination and activity also involve the activation of the MAP kinase ERK, and we further show that PvuBra expression in 3D requires ERK activity. PvuBra expression then rapidly spreads to neighbouring cells that cleave in a bilateral fashion and whose progeny will constitute the posterior edge of the blastopore during gastrulation, suggesting a role for PvuBra in regulating cell movements and cleavage morphology in Patella. Until the completion of gastrulation, PvuBra expression is maintained at the posterior pole, and along the developing anterior-posterior axis. Comparing this expression pattern with what is known in other Bilateria, we advocate that Brachyury might have a conserved role in the regulation of anterior-posterior patterning among Bilateria, through the maintenance of a posterior growth zone, suggesting that a teloblastic mode of axis formation might be ancestral to the Bilateria.</str>

      <str>The mouse Brachyury gene (T) is required in notochord differentiation and posterior mesoderm formation during axial development. We have isolated the chick homologue of T(Ch-T) and determined its putative protein sequence and expression pattern during embryogenesis. Ch-T is expressed in the epiblast close to and within the primitive streak, in early migrating mesoderm and in the notochord. In later stages Ch-T expression is found in the tail bud and in the entire notochord. The notochord expression ceases in an anterior-posterior wave when the formation of the body anlage is completed. This pattern is consistent with those reported for the expression of the mouse T gene and the T homologues of Xenopus laevis and zebrafish, suggesting that the mechanisms of embryonic pattern formation are highly conserved in all vertebrates. The N-terminal half of Ch-T shows a very high degree of sequence identity with the corresponding region of mouse T which has DNA-binding activity, and with the N-terminal half of Xenopus (Xbra) and zebrafish (Ntl) T protein. Finally, we have analyzed the effects of activin A on Ch-T induction and axis formation. Localized activin A treatment of prestreak blastoderms results in ectopic Ch-T expression that correlates with formation of second primitive streaks or with repositioning of the site of single streak origin (Cooke et al., 1994). These results strengthen the previous evidence that Brachyury activation is an early response to axis-inducing signals in vivo.</str>

      <str>A detailed immunohistochemical characterization of different cytokeratin subclasses was performed on frozen tumour tissue from three classical chordomas. Simple epithelium cytokeratins Nos 8, 18, and 19 were detected in all tumour cells while cytokeratin No. 7 was not found. Cytokeratins characteristic of squamous differentiation, including keratinization, were generally lacking, with the exception of the varying expression of cytokeratin No. 4. Vimentin was found in all the tumours, while they lacked desmin immunoreactivity. The present study indicates the co-expression of vimentin and cytokeratins, predominantly of the simple epithelium type. In addition, chordoma cells have the ability to express cytokeratins characteristic of squamous differentiation. This finding corresponds well to the electron microscopic findings of tonofilament bundles ending in well-developed desmosomes.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury, or T, gene is required for notochord development in animals occupying all three chordate subphyla and probably also had this role in the last common ancestor of the chordate lineages. In two chordate subphyla (vertebrates and cephalochordates), T is also expressed during gastrulation in involuting endodermal and mesodermal cells, and in vertebrates at least, this expression domain is required for proper development. In the basally diverging chordate subphylum Urochordata, animals in the class Ascidiacea do not employ T during gastrulation in endodermal or nonaxial mesodermal cells, and it has been suggested that nonnotochordal roles for T were acquired in the cephalochordate-vertebrate lineage after it split with Urochordata. To test this hypothesis, we cloned T from Oikopleura dioica, a member of the urochordate class Appendicularia (or Larvacea), which diverged basally in the subphylum. Investigation of the expression pattern in developing Oikopleura embryos showed early expression in presumptive notochord precursor cells, in the notochord, and in parts of the developing gut and cells of the endodermal strand. We conclude that the ancestral role of T likely included expression in the developing gut and became necessary in chordates for construction of the notochord.</str>

      <str>The Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra) is regulated, in part, by a 434-bp enhancer that mediates restricted expression in the notochord. Here we present evidence that a Ciona Suppressor of Hairless ¿Ci-Su(H)¿ protein functions as an activator of this enhancer. Point mutations that reduce the binding of a GST/Ci-Su(H) fusion protein in vitro diminish the expression of mutagenized Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in electroporated embryos. Overexpression of a Ci-Su(H) fusion protein containing the Drosophila Hairy repression domain interferes with notochord differentiation, producing mutant tadpoles with shortened tails. Expression of a constitutively activated Xotch receptor in the notochord, endoderm, and CNS also alters tail morphogenesis. These results suggest that a Notch-Su(H) pathway might participate in notochord differentiation in Ciona.</str>

      <str>Sacral chordoma is a vessel-rich and infiltrative tumor, but the fundamental knowledge of its biological behavior remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the expression levels and contributions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the angiogenesis and recurrence of sacral chordoma and their correlations. An immunohistochemical method was used to investigate the expression of VEGF, MMP-9, and microvascular density (MVD) in 36 patients with sacral chordoma. Their differences in expressions were statistically analyzed and their correlations with angiogenesis and recurrence were evaluated. The mean MVD of sacral chordomas was significantly higher than that of the adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.033). Immunoreactivity for VEGF and MMP-9 was significantly higher in sacral chordoma tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P = 0.008, P = 0.005). The mean MVD of VEGF and MMP-9 were statistically higher in positive group than in negative group (P = 0.015, P = 0.004), respectively . Moreover, a significant correlation was found between the VEGF and MMP-9 (P = 0.002). The log-rank test revealed that continuous disease-free survival time (CDFS) was significantly shorter in the MMP-9-positive group than in the MMP-9-negative group (P = 0.019), but the difference in the VEGF-positive group and the VEGF-negative group was not statistically significant (P = 0.938). Our data suggest that VEGF and MMP-9 might act with a synergistic effect and can positively regulate the angiogenesis in sacral chordoma. Positive expression of MMP-9 might indicate the local recurrence of sacral chordoma. The result suggests that some specific drugs which inhibit VEGF, MMP-9, or their receptors may have a good therapeutic effect for sacral chordoma.</str>

      <str>A homologue of the T-box gene, Brachyury, has been isolated from hydra. The gene, termed HyBra1, is expressed in the endoderm and is associated with the formation of the hypostome, the apical part of the head in four different developmental situations. In adults, which are continuously undergoing patterning, HyBra1 is continuously expressed in the hypostome. During budding, hydra's asexual form of reproduction, the gene is expressed in a small area that will eventually form the hypostome of the developing bud before any morphological sign of budding is apparent. The gene is also expressed very early during head regeneration and is confined to the region that will form the hypostome. During embryogenesis, HyBra1 is expressed shortly before hatching in the region that will form the apical end of the animal, the hypostome. The absence of expression at the apical end of decapitated animals of reg-16, a head formation-deficient mutant, provides additional evidence for a role of HyBra1 during head formation. Further, treatments that alter the head activation gradient have no effect on HyBra1 expression indicating the role of the gene is confined to head formation. Transplantation experiments indicate that the expression occurs before head determination has occurred, but expression does not irreversibly commit tissue to forming a head. A comparison of the function of the Brachyury homologues suggests an evolutionary conservation of a molecular mechanism that has been co-opted for a number of developmental processes throughout evolution.</str>

      <str>Due to the presence of a blastopore as in amphibians, the turtle has been suggested to exemplify a transition form from an amphibian- to an avian-type gastrulation pattern. In order to test this hypothesis and gain insight into the emergence of the unique characteristics of amniotes during gastrulation, we have performed the first molecular characterization of the gastrula in a reptile, the turtle Emys orbicularis. The study of Brachyury, Lim1, Otx2 and Otx5 expression patterns points to a highly conserved dynamic of expression with amniote model organisms and makes it possible to identify the site of mesoderm internalization, which is a long-standing issue in reptiles. Analysis of Brachyury expression also highlights the presence of two distinct phases, less easily recognizable in model organisms and respectively characterized by an early ring-shaped and a later bilateral symmetrical territory. Systematic comparisons with tetrapod model organisms lead to new insights into the relationships of the blastopore/blastoporal plate system shared by all reptiles, with the blastopore of amphibians and the primitive streak of birds and mammals. The biphasic Brachyury expression pattern is also consistent with recent models of emergence of bilateral symmetry, which raises the question of its evolutionary significance.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are tumors of notochordal differentiation of low to intermediate grade malignancy. These tumors are typically slow growing, with an indolent but progressive clinical course. We present a case of a highly proliferative chordoma arising in a 73-year-old woman with unusually rapid clinical growth and aggressive histologic and immunohistochemical features. This patient had an unusually brief preclinical course and within 1 month of developing headaches presented to medical attention with diplopia. The resected chordoma showed uncommonly elevated mitotic activity, without the histologic hallmarks of de-differentiation. This proliferative activity correlated with elevated Ki67 staining (60%), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma1 (BCL1) expression (100%), and topoisomerase IIα staining (&gt;95%). E-cadherin expression was also lost throughout the majority of the tumor. Other markers of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) including vimentin, N-cadherin, Slug and Twist, were also strongly expressed in this aggressive tumor. The sellar component of the tumor recurred within a 2-month interval. The evaluation of the additional biomarkers, including makers of EMT studied in this, case may allow for identification of aggressive chordomas in which the tempo of disease is significantly more rapid than in typical cases of chordoma. </str>

      <str>Chordomas mainly arise along the axial skeleton and are characterized by their slow but destructive growth. Prognosis and quality of life are poor because treatment options are mainly limited to surgery and radiotherapy. Survivin, a member of the apoptosis inhibitor protein family, functions as a key regulator of mitosis and programmed cell death, and is overexpressed in many tumor types. The aim of this study was to determine the role of survivin in chordomas. Survivin expression was investigated in 50 chordoma samples and three chordoma cell lines using immunohistochemistry. The intensity of immunostaining was evaluated in regard to the development of recurrences. The immunohistochemical results were correlated with clinical parameters like gender, age, tumor size, and location and were performed in primary chordomas as well as in recurrent lesions. Furthermore, survivin knockdown experiments on chordoma cell lines were performed. YM155 decreased the growth behavior of chordoma cells dose- and time dependently. Transient knockdown of survivin led to a G2/M arrest, decreased proliferation, consistently induced an increase of polyploidy and morphological changes, and induced apoptosis. The resultant data from this study suggest that survivin plays a cell cycle-progressive role in chordomas. Hence, regulation of survivin by YM155 is a promising new target for the development of new therapeutic drugs. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      <str>Gastrulation in the marsupial frog Gastrotheca riobambae has been analyzed by the distribution of the Brachyury (T) protein. Comparison with other amphibians provides mechanistic insights, since G. riobambae develops slowly and has the most divergent mode of amphibian gastrulation, producing an embryonic disk. The T pattern indicates that the prospective mesoderm is superficial, as in many amphibians. The dorsal blastopore lip could not be identified by the expression of T, or by morphological criteria, thus it is unknown whether Gastrotheca embryos have a dorsal organizer before or after blastopore closure. The circumblastoporal and notochordal expression of T, which are temporally contiguous in Xenopus, are separated in Gastrotheca, implying that distinct regulatory mechanisms may control the expression of T in its two domains. The separation of the T pattern also indicates that involution at the blastopore is separate from notochord formation. In addition, extension of the archenteron and notochord occurs after blastopore closure, suggesting that dorsal convergence and extension have been delayed until after blastopore closure. Therefore, dorsal convergence and extension need not be the cause of blastopore closure in Gastrotheca. The separation of gastrulation events in embryos that have not been experimentally manipulated, such as those of Gastrotheca, helps in understanding the distinct nature of gastrulation processes.</str>

To this end, we have identified and characterized a novel murine and human gene encoding a putative transcription factor related to the Brachyury (T) gene that is expressed only in postmitotic cells. T-brain-1 (Tbr-1) mRNA is largely restricted to the cerebral cortex, where during embryogenesis it distinguishes domains that we propose may give rise to paleocortex, limbic cortex, and neocortex. Tbr-1 and Id-2 expression in the neocortex have discontinuities that define molecularly distinct neocortical areas. Tbr-1 expression is analyzed in the context of the prosomeric model.

      <str>The notochord is a defining character of the chordates, and the T-box transcription factor Brachyury has been shown to be required for notochord development in all chordates examined. In the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, at least 44 notochord genes have been identified as bona fide transcriptional targets of Brachyury. We examined the embryonic expression of a subset of murine orthologs of Ciona Brachyury target genes in the notochord to assess its conservation throughout chordate evolution. We focused on analyzing the Leprecan gene family, which in mouse is composed of three genes, as opposed to the single-copy Ciona gene. We found that all three mouse Leprecan genes are expressed in the notochord. Additionally, while Leprecan expression in C. intestinalis is confined to the notochord, expression of its mouse orthologs includes dorsal root ganglia, limb buds, branchial arches, and developing kidneys. These results have interesting implications for the evolution and development of chordates.</str>

      <str>Trichoplax adhaerens is the only species known from the phylum Placozoa with one of the simplest metazoan body plans. In the small disc-like organism an upper and a lower epithelium can be distinguished with a less compact third cell layer in between. When Trichoplax was first described in 1883, the relation of these three cell layers with ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm of higher animals was discussed. Still, little is known about embryonic development of Trichoplax, however, genes thought to be specific for mesoderm in bilaterian animals turned out to be already present in non-bilaterians. Searching for a Brachyury homologue, two members of the T-box gene family were isolated from Trichoplax, Brachyury and a Tbx2/3 homologue. The T-box genes encode a transcription factor family characterized by the DNA-binding T-box domain. T-box genes have been found in all metazoans so far investigated, but in contrast to other transcription factors such as the homeobox family, T-box genes are not present in plants or fungi. The distinct expression patterns of two T-box genes in Trichoplax point to non-redundant functions already present at the beginning of animal evolution. Since the expression patterns derived by in situ hybridization do not overlap with anatomical structures, it can be concluded that this simple animal has more than the four cell types described in the literature. This hidden complexity and the unresolved position in relation to Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora and Bilateria highlight the necessity of the inclusion of Trichoplax in studies of comparative evolutionary and developmental biology.</str>

      <str>We have previously isolated a cDNA clone coding for Xenopus AP-2rep (activator protein-2 repressor), a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, and reported its expression pattern in developing Xenopus embryos. In the present study, the physiological function of AP-2rep in the morphogenetic movements of the dorsal mesoderm and ectoderm was investigated. Embryos injected with either AP-2rep or VP16repC (a dominant-negative mutant) into the dorsal marginal zone at the 4-cell stage exhibited abnormal morphology in dorsal structures. Both AP-2rep and VP16repC also inhibited the elongation of animal cap explants treated with activin without affecting the expression of differentiation markers. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that expression of brachyury and Wnt11 was greatly suppressed by injection of VP16repC or AP-2rep morpholino, but expression was restored by the simultaneous injection of wild-type AP-2rep RNA. Furthermore, the morphogenetic abnormality induced by injection of VP16repC or AP-2rep morpholino was restored by simultaneous injection of brachyury or Wnt11 mRNA. These results show that AP-2rep is involved in the morphogenesis of the mesoderm at the gastrula stage, via the brachyury and/or Wnt pathways.</str>

      <str>In order to gain insights into the evolution of gastrulation mechanisms among vertebrates, we have characterized a Brachyury-related gene in a lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis, and in a chondrichthyan, Scyliorhinus canicula. These two genes, respectively termed LfT and ScT, share with their osteichthyan counterparts prominent expression sites in the developing notochord, the tailbud, but also a transient expression in the prechordal plate, which is likely to be ancestral among vertebrates. In addition, the lamprey LfT gene is transcribed in the endoderm of the pharyngeal arches and the epiphysis, two expression sites that have not been reported thus far in gnathostomes, and, as in the chick, in the differentiating nephrotomes. Since Brachyury expression in nascent mesoderm and endoderm is highly conserved among vertebrates as well as cephalochordates, we have used this marker to identify these cell populations during gastrulation in the dogfish. The results suggest that these cells are initially present over the whole margin of the blastoderm and are displaced during gastrulation to its posterior part, which may correspond to the site of mesoderm and endoderm internalization. These data provide the first molecular characterization of gastrulation in a chondrichthyan. They indicate that gastrulation in the dogfish and in some amniotes shares striking similarities despite the phylogenetic distance between these species. This supports the hypothesis that the extensively divergent morphologies of gastrulae among vertebrates largely result from adaptations to the presence of yolk.</str>

      <str>Most bilaterian animals possess a through gut with a separate mouth and anus. It is commonly believed that during the transition from radial to bilateral symmetry, both openings evolved simultaneously by the lateral closure of a slit-like blastopore. Molecular phylogenies however, place the acoel flatworms, which have only one opening to their digestive system, as the sister group to all remaining Bilateria. To address how this single body opening is related to the mouth and anus of the protostomes and deuterostomes, we studied the expression of genes involved in bilaterian foregut and hindgut patterning during the development of the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura. Here we show that the genes brachyury and goosecoid are expressed in association with the acoel mouth, suggesting that this single opening is homologous to the mouth of other bilaterians. In addition, we find that the genes caudal, orthopedia and brachyury-which are expressed in various bilaterian hindguts-are expressed in a small region at the posterior end of the animal, separated from the anterior oral brachyury-expressing region by a dorsal domain of ectodermal bmp2/4 expression. These results contradict the hypothesis that the bilaterian mouth and anus evolved simultaneously from a common blastoporal opening, and suggest that a through gut might have evolved independently in different animal lineages.</str>

      <str>We studied the role of Wnt signaling in axis formation during metamorphosis and regeneration in the cnidarian Hydractinia. Activation of Wnt downstream events during metamorphosis resulted in a complete oralization of the animals and repression of aboral structures (i.e. stolons). The expression of Wnt3, Tcf and Brachyury was upregulated and became ubiquitous. Rescue experiments using Tcf RNAi resulted in normal metamorphosis and quantitatively normal Wnt3 and Brachyury expression. Isolated, decapitated polyps regenerated only heads but no stolons. Activation of Wnt downstream targets in regenerating animals resulted in oralization of the polyps. Knocking down Tcf or Wnt3 by RNAi inhibited head regeneration and resulted in complex phenotypes that included ectopic aboral structures. Multiple heads then grew when the RNAi effect had dissipated. Our results provide functional evidence that Wnt promotes head formation but represses the formation of stolons, whereas downregulation of Wnt promotes stolons and represses head formation.</str>

      <str>We have previously shown that the member of the HES family hairy2 induces the ectopic expression of dorsal markers when it is overexpressed in the ventral side of Xenopus embryos. Intriguingly, hairy2 represses the mesoderm transcription factor brachyury (bra) throughout its domain in the marginal zone. Here we show that in early gastrula, bra and hairy2 are expressed in complementary domains. Overexpression of bra repressed hairy2. Interference of bra function with a dominant-negative construct expanded the hairy2 domain and, like hairy2 overexpression, promoted ectopic expression of dorsal axial markers in the ventral side and induced secondary axes without head and notochord. Hairy2 depletion rescued the ectopic dorsal development induced by interference of bra function. We concluded that an intact bra function is necessary to exclude hairy2 expression from the non-organiser field, to impede the ectopic specification of dorsal axial fates and the appearance of incomplete secondary axes. This evidence supports a previously unrecognised role for bra in maintaining the dorsal fates inhibited in the ventral marginal zone, preventing the appearance of trunk duplications.</str>

      <str>The development of the hematopoietic system involves multiple cellular steps beginning with the formation of the mesoderm from the primitive streak, followed by emergence of precursor populations that become committed to either the endothelial or hematopoietic lineages. A number of growth factors such as activins and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are known to regulate the early specification of hematopoietic fated mesoderm, notably in amphibians. However, the potential roles of these factors in the development of mesoderm and subsequent hematopoiesis in the human have yet to be delineated. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which combinations of mesoderm-inducing factors regulate this stepwise process in human cells in vitro is central to effectively directing human embryonic stem cell (hESC) hematopoietic differentiation. Herein, using hESC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs), we show that Activin A, but not basic FGF/FGF2 (bFGF), promotes hematopoietic fated mesodermal specification from pluripotent human cells. The effect of Activin A treatment relies on the presence of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and both of the hematopoietic cytokines stem cell factor and fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ligand, and is the consequence of 2 separate mechanisms occurring at 2 different stages of human EB development from mesoderm to blood. While Activin A promotes the induction of mesoderm, as indicated by the upregulation of Brachyury expression, which represents the mesodermal precursor required for hematopoietic development, it also contributes to the expansion of cells already committed to a hematopoietic fate. As hematopoietic development requires the transition through a Brachyury+ intermediate, we demonstrate that hematopoiesis in hESCs is impaired by the downregulation of Brachyury, but is unaffected by its overexpression. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the functional significance of Brachyury in the developmental program of hematopoietic differentiation from hESCs and provide an in-depth understanding of the molecular cues that orchestrate stepwise development of hematopoiesis in a human system.</str>

      <str>Understanding the mechanism by which embryonic stem (ES) cells self-renew is crucial for the realization of their therapeutic potential. Earlier, overexpression of Id proteins was shown to be sufficient to maintain mouse ES cells in a self-renewing state even in the absence of serum. Here, we use ES cells derived from Id deficient mice to investigate the requirement for Id proteins in maintaining ES cell self-renewal. We find that Id1(-/-) ES cells have a defect in self-renewal and a propensity to differentiate. We observe that chronic or acute loss of Id1 leads to a down-regulation of Nanog, a critical regulator of self-renewal. In addition, in the absence of Id1, ES cells express elevated levels of Brachyury, a marker of mesendoderm differentiation. We find that loss of both Nanog and Id1 is required for the up-regulation of Brachyury, and ectopic Nanog expression in Id1(-/-) ES cells rescues the self-renewal defect, indicating that Nanog is the major downstream target of Id1. These results identify Id1 as a critical factor in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal and suggest a plausible mechanism for its control of lineage commitment.</str>

      <str>Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to play a crucial role in bone formation in vivo. We sought to determine the temporal effect of NO on murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) under culture conditions that promote osteogenesis. Expression profiles of NO pathway members and osteoblast-specific markers were analyzed using appropriate assays. We found that NO was supportive of osteogenesis specifically during an early phase of in vitro development (days 3-5). Furthermore, ESCs stably overexpressing the inducible NO synthase showed accelerated and enhanced osteogenesis in vitro and in bone explant cultures. To determine the role of NO in early lineage commitment, a stage in ESC differentiation equivalent to primitive streak formation in vivo, ESCs were transfected with a T-brachyury-GFP reporter. Expression levels of T-brachyury and one of its upstream regulators, β-catenin, the major effector in the canonical Wnt pathway, were responsive to NO levels in differentiating primitive streak-like cells. Our results indicate that NO may be involved in early differentiation through regulation of β-catenin and T-brachyury, controlling the specification of primitive-streak-like cells, which may continue through differentiation to later become osteoblasts.</str>

      <str>We describe the identification, biochemical characterisation, and mutation of a novel mouse gene: Sp5. Sp5 encodes a protein having a C-terminal C(2)H(2) zinc finger domain closely related to that of the transcription factor Sp1. In vitro, DNA binding studies show that it binds to the GC box, a DNA motif present in the promoter of a very large number of genes, including Brachyury, and recognised by members of the Sp1 family. However, outside of its DNA binding domain, Sp5 has little homology with any other member of the Sp1 family. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of Sp1, Sp5 exhibits a remarkably dynamic pattern of expression throughout early development. This is suggestive of a role in numerous tissue patterning events, including gastrulation and axial elongation; differentiation and patterning of the neural tube, pharyngeal region, and somites; and formation of skeletal muscle in the body and limbs. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in Sp5 show no overt phenotype. However, the enhancement of the T/+ phenotype in compound mutant mice (Sp5(lacZ)/Sp5(lacZ), T/+) indicates a genetic interaction between Sp5 and Brachyury. These observations are consistent with a role for Sp5 in the coordination of changes in transcription required to generate pattern in the developing embryo.</str>

      <str>We investigated the functional role of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in regulating cardiomyogenesis using mouse P19CL6 embryonic carcinoma cells. ECP was confirmed to accelerate the cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19CL6 cells by enhancing the rate and area size of beating of cardiomyocyte and by facilitating the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific genes, such as GATA4 and α-MHC. Since cardiomyocyte differentiation in vivo is considered to follow mesoderm induction, the induction of Brachyury, a marker of mesoderm, was assessed. Brachyury expression was found to be enhanced after the addition of ECP. This enhancement was due to the stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation by ECP. In this context, treatment with SU5402, an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1, suppressed Brachyury expression, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and cardiomyocyte differentiation induced by ECP. We concluded that ECP might induce mesoderm differentiation through FGF signaling pathway and enhance subsequent cardiomyocyte differentiation in concert with dimethyl sulfoxide in P19CL6 cells. ECP may be a novel factor for cardiomyocyte differentiation, which should be very useful to prepare adequate numbers of cardiomyocytes for therapeutic cell transplantation.</str>

      <str>Primary soft tissue myoepithelial tumours (METs) are rare. Recent studies have shown EWSR1 rearrangement in certain METs. We present clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of 14 primary soft tissue METs. Fourteen tumours, five benign and nine malignant, occurred in 12 men and two women, with an age range of 18-60 years (mean, 39.2); in upper extremities, four (29 %); chest wall, three (21 %); paraspinal region, three (21 %); pelvis, two (14 %) and lower extremities, two (14 %). Tumour size varied from 2 to 21.6 cm (mean, 8.7). Microscopically, most tumours were at least focally circumscribed. Morphological heterogeneity was noted, commonest patterns being cord-like and diffuse arrangement of polygonal cells in a myxoid stroma. By immunohistochemistry, tumours were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) (10/12, 83 %), cytokeratin (CK)/MNF116 (3/12, 25 %), p63 (7/10, 70 %), CD10 (4/6, 67 %), calponin (6/6, 100 %), S-100P (11/13, 85 %), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (6/12, 50 %), smooth muscle actin (SMA) (3/9, 33 %), INI1/SMARCB1 (6/10, 60 %), brachyury (0/11), CD34 (0/5) and vimentin (4/4, 100 %), implying 93 % positivity for at least one epithelial marker. EWSR1 gene rearrangement was detected in 3/6 (50 %) METs (one benign and two malignant) and in an eccrine porocarcinoma which was included for reasons of comparison. Outcome details were available for six patients all surgically treated; three tumours (two malignant and one benign) resected with unknown marginal status recurred; two patients died and a single patient with myoepithelial carcinoma, who underwent a wide excision, is disease-free. This study illustrates the wide morphological spectrum of soft tissue METs, including benign and malignant subtypes. EMA and S-100P are optimal markers that should be supplemented with broad spectrum keratins, such as AE1/AE3, along with p63, GFAP and calponin in case of need but the results must be correlated with morphological features. Brachyury is useful in separating parachordoma/myoepithelioma from chordoma. EWSR1 rearrangement mostly occurs in METs that are deep-seated, irrespective of benign or malignant behaviour. Most malignant METs are INI1 negative.</str>

      <str>Intralesional fibrous septum (IFS) generally is considered a reactive tissue in chordoma; however, little is known about its significance. We studied 122 chordomas for IFS using immunohistochemical techniques and compared IFS and lobular growth patterns (LGPs) formed by IFS with clinicopathologic parameters. Seventy-nine tumors (64.8%) revealed IFS. However, IFS frequently was infiltrated and interrupted by tumor cells with increased expression of proteases; only 33 (42%) of 79 tumors had LGP. In non-skull base chordomas, IFS and LGP were associated with nuclear pleomorphism, a previously described prognostic indicator, mitosis, and the MIB-1 labeling index, indicating a role of IFS and LGP in tumor growth or progression. Paradoxically, patients without LGP tended to have a worse prognosis than those with LGP. We believe that IFS exerts diverse influences on chordoma; however, invasion of IFS leading to loss of the LGP indicates advanced stages of tumor development, possibly predicting an unfavorable prognosis in chordoma.</str>

      <str>Mature cystic teratoma of the ovary (MCTO) is the most common type of ovarian teratoma and also the most frequent tumor originating from germ cells. It is usually diagnosed in early adulthood and, by definition, is composed of well-differentiated tissues, which originate from all three germ cell layers. Unusual types of tissues can be found in MCTO, such as kidney, adrenal, and prostatic tissues. Malignant transformation is reported in less than 2% of teratomas. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy arising in these otherwise benign tumors. We present the first case of MCTO containing a chordoma. The chordoma differentiation was supported by immunohistochemical staining and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (IP-FISH) technique showing 19% of the nuclei of the MCTO displaying polysomy for the chromosome X, while 28% of the chordoma nuclei showed chromosome 7 mosaicism. These results are concordant with previous studies, showing chromosomal anomalies in chromosomes X and 7 in MCTO and chordomas, respectively.</str>

      <str>We report the first cytogenetic investigation of cranial chordoma. Three cranial chordomas were examined, two of which could be further histopathologically classified as chondroid chordomas. In addition, we have included a case of chordoma of a cervical vertebra to compare the cytogenetic abnormalities. Diagnosis was made at histological and immunohistochemical levels. The three cases of cranial chordoma showed a normal karyotype, while one vertebra showed 46,XY,t(6;11)(q12;q23). Chordomas, particularly those containing cartilage, have to be distinguished from chondrosarcomas of the skull base. Such a distinction is normally based on expression of epithelial markers which usually are lacking in chondrosarcoma. Cytogenetic investigation may eventually prove to be useful in the distinction of the two lesions, if chromosome anomalies are consistently absent in chordoma, although some chondrosarcomas may also present a normal karyotype. Such a distinction has clinical implications because chondroid chordomas show better survival, whereas chondrosarcomas show a propensity to infiltrate the surrounding tissues.</str>

      <str>This work concerns the expression of two transcription factors during the development of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus: SpNot, the orthologue of the vertebrate Not gene, and SpBra, the orthologue of the vertebrate Brachyury gene. SpNot transcripts are detected by in situ hybridization in the vegetal plate at the mesenchyme-blastula stage. Later the gene is expressed in the secondary mesenchyme, but expression is no longer detectable after gastrulation. SpNot is upregulated during larval development, in the invaginating vestibule of the adult rudiment. Transcripts are also found in several larva-specific tissues, including the epaulets, blastocoelar cells, and pigment cells. SpBra also displays a discontinuous pattern of expression. Much like SpNot, this gene is expressed during embryogenesis in the embryonic vegetal plate and secondary mesenchyme founder cells, and expression is then extinguished. The gene is upregulated over a week later in the feeding larva, in the vestibule of the adult rudiment. In contrast to SpNot, SpBra is also expressed in the mesoderm of both left and right hydrocoels, and it is not expressed in any larva-specific tissues. We compare the spatial expression profile determined in this study with that of the orthologous Brachyury gene in an indirectly developing enteropneust hemichordate, a representative of the sister group to the echinoderms within the deuterostomes. These observations illuminate the genetic basis underlying the process of maximal indirect development in basal deuterostomes. Finally, Brachyury appears to be an excellent marker for the progeny of the set-aside cells of the sea urchin embryo.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare tumour arising from the embryonal remnants of a notochord occurring most commonly in the sacrococcygeal as well as head and neck locations. Current treatment includes surgery and/or proton beam radiotherapy. In several cases especially in the head and neck location, surgery is not advised. Proton beam therapy is not always effective enough to eradicate the tumour. Additional modes of therapy are needed. One of the current therapeutic approaches in various tumours is targeted therapy and one of the targets is EGFR. The aim of this study was to evaluate EGFR expression and EGFR gene status of chordoma. Twenty-one cases of chordoma were retrieved from the in-house and consultation files of the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-EGFR antibody and FISH was performed on slides obtained from representative archival paraffin blocks. In our study 81% of cases of chordoma showed low to high EGFR expression in immunohistochemistry. In six cases (26.6%) the FISH results for EGFR were classified as positive (an average EGFR copy number &gt; or = 4 per cell). There was one case of chromosome 7 aneuploidy reported.</str>

      <str>Classical mutations at the mouse Brachyury (T) locus were discovered because they lead to shortened tails in heterozygous newborns. no tail (ntl) mutants in the zebrafish, as their name suggests, show a similar phenotype. In Drosophila, mutants in the brachyenteron (byn) gene disrupt hindgut formation. These genes all encode T-box proteins, a class of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and transcription factors. Mutations in the C. elegans mab-9 gene cause massive defects in the male tail because of failed fate decisions in two tail progenitor cells. In a recent paper, Woollard and Hodgkin have cloned the mab-9 gene and found that it too encodes a T-box protein, similar to Brachyury in vertebrates and brachyenteron in Drosophila. The authors suggest that their results support models for an evolutionarily ancient role for these genes in hindgut formation. We will discuss this proposal and try to decide whether the gene sequences, gene interactions and gene expression patterns allow any conclusions to be made about the rear end of the ancestral metazoan.</str>

      <str>Desmin contributes to structural integrity and function of the myocardium but its function seems to be redundant in early cardiomyogenesis in the desmin null mouse model. To test the hypothesis that desmin also plays a supportive role in cardiomyogenic commitment and early differentiation of cardiomyocytes we investigated cardiomyogenesis in embryoid bodies expressing different desmin alleles. Constitutive expression of desmin and increased synthesis during mesoderm formation led to the up-regulation of brachyury and nkx2.5 genes, accelerated early cardiomyogenesis and resulted in the development of large, proliferating, highly interconnected, and synchronously beating cardiomyocyte clusters, whereas desmin null cardiomyocytes featured an opposite phenotype. In contrast, constitutive expression of amino-terminally truncated desmin(Delta1-48) interfered with the beginning of cardiomyogenesis, caused down-regulation of mesodermal and myocardial transcription factors, and hampered myofibrillogenesis and survival of cardiomyocytes. These results provide first evidence that a type III intermediate filament protein takes part in regulating the differentiation of mesoderm to cardiomyocytes at the very beginning of cardiomyogenesis.</str>

For validation of the vector system, we generated mutant phenotypes for Brachyury, Foxa2 and Noto, transcription factors which play pivotal roles in embryonic development. Using a series of Brachyury shRNAmir vectors of various strengths we generated hypomorphic and loss of function phenotypes allowing the identification of Brachyury target genes involved in trunk development. We also demonstrate temporal control of gene silencing, thus bypassing early embryonic lethality. Importantly, off-target effects of shRNAmir expression were not detectable. Taken together, the system allows the dissection of gene function at unprecedented detail and speed, and provides tight control of the genetic background minimizing intrinsic variation.</str>

Brachyury downstream notochord differentiation in the ascidian embryo. Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). By screening approximately 14 kb of the Ci-leprecan locus for cis-regulatory activity, we have identified a 581-bp minimal notochord-specific cis-regulatory module (CRM) whose activity depends upon T-box binding sites located at the 3'-end of its sequence. These sites are specifically bound in vitro by a GST-Ci-Bra fusion protein, and mutations that abolish binding in vitro result in loss or decrease of regulatory activity in vivo. Serial deletions of the 581-bp notochord CRM revealed that this sequence is also able to direct expression in muscle cells through the same T-box sites that are utilized by Ci-Bra in the notochord, which are also bound in vitro by the muscle-specific T-box activators Ci-Tbx6b and Ci-Tbx6c. Additionally, we created plasmids aimed to interfere with the function of Ci-leprecan and categorized the resulting phenotypes, which consist of variable dislocations of notochord cells along the anterior-posterior axis. Together, these observations provide mechanistic insights generally applicable to T-box transcription factors and their target sequences, as well as a first set of clues on the function of Leprecan in early chordate development.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is the fourth most common malignant primary neoplasm of the skeleton and almost the only one showing a real epithelial phenotype. Besides classic chordoma, so-called chondroid chordoma was described as a specific entity showing cartilage-like tissue within chordomatoid structures. However, since its first description, strongly conflicting results have been reported about the existence of chondroid chordoma and several studies suggested chondroid chordomas being in fact low-grade conventional chondrosarcomas. In the present study, we used cytoprotein expression profiling and molecular in situ localization techniques of marker gene products indicative of developmental phenotypes of chondrocytes to elucidate origin and biology of chondroid chordoma. We were able to demonstrate the chondrogenic potential of chordomas irrespectively of the appearance of overt cartilage formation by identifying the multifocal expression of type II collagen, the main marker of chondrocytic differentiation. Additionally, the cartilage-typical large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was present throughout all chordomas and, thus, a very characteristic gene product and marker of these neoplasms. Biochemical matrix composition and cell differentiation pattern analysis showed a high resemblance of classic chordomas and in chordoid areas of chondroid chordomas to the fetal chorda dorsalis, whereas chondroid areas of chondroid chordomas showed features similar to adult nucleus pulposus. This demonstrates on the cell function level the chondrocytic differentiation potential of neoplastic chordoid cells as a characteristic facet of chordomas, mimicking fetal vertebral development, ie, the transition of the chorda dorsalis to the nucleus pulposus. Our study firmly establishes a focal real chondrocytic phenotype of neoplastic cells in chordomas.

Herein, we present a rare case of a mixed tumor/myoepithelioma arising in the iliac bone of a young adult male who presented with swelling in his right hip. Radiological imaging disclosed a large, intraosseous, lytic, heterogenous mass with a soft tissue component. Biopsy and subsequent tumor resection showed an 18cm sized tumor involving the iliac bone and soft tissues and comprising polygonal and spindly cells, arranged in cords and aggregates, embedded in a myxohyaline stroma with osteochondroid differentiation. Tumor cells exhibited mild nuclear variation, rare mitotic figures, focal cytoplasmic clearing, and prominent squamous differentiation. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor cells were diffusely positive for S100-P, EMA, CK5/6, p63, GFAP, calponin, and focally positive for CK/MNF116, but negative for Brachyury/T. Diagnosis of a myoepithelioma/mixed tumor was offered. Further, cytogenetic analysis revealed lack of EWSR1 gene rearrangement and showed clonal trisomies of 11, 15, 17 with del (16q) and del (22q11). The present case is a rare documentation of a myoepithelioma in the appendicular bones and the second such case identified in the iliac bone.

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignancies of the axial skeleton. Therapy is mainly restricted to surgery. This study investigates histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as potential therapeutics for chordomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the HDAC 1-6 antibodies on 50 chordoma samples (34 primary tumors, 16 recurrences) from 44 patients (27 male, 17 female). Pan-HDAC-inhibitors Vorinostat (SAHA), Panobinostat (LBH-589), and Belinostat (PXD101) were tested for their efficacy in the chordoma cell line MUG-Chor1 via Western blot, cell cycle analysis, caspase 3/7 activity (MUG-Chor1, UCh-1), cleaved caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. p-Values below 0.05 were considered significant. IHC was negative for HDAC1, positive for HDAC2 in most (n = 36; 72%), and for HDACs 3-6 in all specimens available (n = 43; 86%). HDAC6 expression was strongest. SAHA and LBH-589, but not PXD101 caused a significant increase of G2/M phase cells and of cleaved caspase-3 (p = 0.0003, and p = 0.0014 after 72 h, respectively), and a peak of caspase 3/7 activity. PARP cleavage confirmed apoptosis. The presented chordoma series expressed HDACs 2-6 with strongest expression of HDAC6.

      <str>Reports of sex steroid receptor expression in chordoma suggest that these tumors may be responsive to hormone manipulation therapy. Immunohistochemical stains for estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER-beta, progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), were performed on a tissue microarray containing 21 samples of chordoma. Most chordomas expressed COX-2, ER-beta, and AR, whereas ER-alpha and PR stains were negative in all cases. ER-beta expression did not correlate with AR expression (P = .4142; McNemar test). There were no statistically significant correlations between the expression of any of these markers and anatomic location of tumor, patient sex, patient age, or disease-free survival. Chordomas commonly express COX-2, AR, and ER-beta. These findings may have therapeutic implications concerning the use of agents that inhibit or modulate these signaling molecules.</str>

      <str>Brachyury (T) is involved in mesoderm induction during early mouse development. T expression in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells, which differentiate into mesoderm derivatives in vitro, was studied. Endogenous T expression in P19 cells was transiently induced when the cells were allowed to form aggregates. This expression was enhanced by dimethyl sulfoxide. In situ hybridization showed that T expressing cells formed clusters on the aggregates. Transfection of plasmids encoding reporter genes under the control of the upstream region of T showed that the sequence up to -351 bp can resemble the differentiation-dependent expression of T in P19 cells. To define the promoter region regulating T expression, transgenic mice carrying LacZ under the control of the upstream region were prepared. The region up to -351 bp is sufficient to direct the expression in the primitive streak and tail-bud. The upstream region up to -2400 bp does not support expression in the notochord. The sequence between -987 and -585 bp enhances expression in the primitive streak and tail-bud. In the tail-bud where new cells for elongation of the anteroposterior axis were continuously supplied, the sequence up to -987 bp drove lacZ expression in gut endoderm and prospective neuroectoderm as well as in mesoderm derivatives.</str>

      <str>Holt-Oram syndrome is caused by mutations in TBX5, a member of the T-box gene family. In order to identify DNA sequences to which the TBX5 protein binds, we have performed an in vitro binding site selection assay. We have identified an 8 bp core sequence that is part of the Brachyury consensus-binding site. We show that TBX5 binds to the full palindromic Brachyury binding site and to the half-palindrome, whereas Brachyury does not bind to the TBX5 site. Amino acids 1-237 of TBX5 are required for DNA binding. Analysis of the effects of specific substitution mutations that arise in Holt-Oram patients indicates that G80R and R237Q eliminate binding to the target site. DNA database analysis reveals that target sites are present in the upstream regions of several cardiac-expressed genes including cardiac alpha actin, atrial natriuretic factor, cardiac myosin heavy chain alpha, cardiac myosin heavy chain beta, myosin light chain 1A, myosin light chain 1V and Nkx2.5. Cell transfection studies demonstrate that TBX5 activates the transcription of an atrial natriuretic factor reporter construct and this effect is significantly reduced by deletion of the TBX5 binding site.</str>

      <str>We report here on four patients from three consanguineous families exhibiting sacral agenesis, a persistent notochordal canal and abnormal ossification of the vertebral bodies, and the identification and characterisation of their underlying genetic defect. Given the consanguineous nature and the similarity of the phenotypes between the three families, we performed homozygosity mapping and identified a common 4.1 Mb homozygous region on chromosome 6q27, containing T, brachyury homologue (mouse) or T. Sequencing of T in the affected individuals led to the identification of a homozygous missense mutation, p.H171R, in the highly conserved T-box. The homozygous mutation results in diminished DNA binding, increased cell growth, and interferes with the normal expression of genes involved in ossification, notochord maintenance and axial mesoderm development.</str>

      <str>The T-box genes, including Brachyury, encode a novel family of transcription factors that play critical roles in various processes of development, in particular, mesoderm formation in chordate embryos. In the case of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, the Brachyury (As-T) is expressed exclusively in notochord cells, whereas another T-box gene (As-T2) is expressed in the muscle cells and in the tip of the tail of tailbud embryos. In a previous study, we suggested that the combined pattern of the spatial expressions of As-T and As-T2 appears to correspond to that of a single vertebrate Brachyury gene (Yasuo et al., Dev Biol 1996;180:773-779). The present molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that As-T2 is a divergent member of the T-box family with a similarity to the Tbx6 subfamily. Vertebrate members of this subfamily are expressed in the posterior paraxial mesoderm, and the mouse Tbx6 is essential for the specification of posterior somite. To investigate the function of As-T2, we examined an ectopic- and/or overexpression of this gene by injecting synthetic mRNA into fertilized eggs. The results showed that the injection of As-T2 mRNA induced an ectopic expression of muscle-specific myosin heavy-chain gene and actin gene, especially in presumptive epidermal cells. This ectopic muscle-specific expression was accompanied by the partial suppression of an epidermis-specific gene expression. The overexpression of As-T2, however, rarely affected the expression of As-T (Brachyury) and genes that are expressed in the tailbud.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury (T) gene is required for notochord differentiation in vertebrates. We have identified a Drosophila gene, the T-related gene (Trg), with high similarity to T within a stretch of approximately 200 amino acids, the DNA-binding domain of T. Trg is expressed throughout embryogenesis, first at the blastoderm stage in the hindgut primordium under the control of the terminal gap genes tll and hkb, and then until the end of embryogenesis in the differentiating hindgut. Drosophila embryos deficient for Trg do not form the hindgut, a phenotype that can be rescued by a Trg transgene. Thus, a common feature of T and Trg is their requirement in specifying the development of a single embryonic structure. Homologs of Trg are also expressed in the developing hindgut of Tribolium and Locusta embryos suggesting a highly conserved function of Trg in insects. This conservation and the high similarity of T and Trg raise the question of a common evolutionary origin of the hindgut of insects and the notochord of chordates.</str>

The transgenic lines were made using a technique in which the endonuclease I-SceI was coinjected into fertilized eggs with a transgene construct containing flanking recognition sites for I-SceI. Two founder animals, out of 12 F(0) adults tested, were found to transmit the transgene to their offspring (F(1)s) at frequencies of 42% and 23%. The transgene was further inherited by the F(2) in a Mendelian fashion and displayed nonmosaic expression, indicating integration into the genome. The Mendelian inheritance and the absence of mosaicism persisted through the F(3) and F(4) generations. Southern blot analyses showed that the transgene was organized in tandem arrays of no more than 10 copies.

      <str>The mouse T (Brachyury) gene is required for normal mesoderm development and the extension of the body axis. Recently, two mutant alleles of a zebrafish gene, no tail (ntl), have been isolated (Halpern, M. E., Ho., R. K., Walker, C. and Kimmel, C. B. (1993) Cell 75, 99-111). ntl mutant embryos resemble mouse T/T mutant embryos in that they lack a differentiated notochord and the caudal region of their bodies. We report here that this phenotype is caused by mutation of the zebrafish homologue of the T gene. While ntl embryos express mutant mRNA, they show no nuclear protein product. Later, expression of mRNA in mutants, but not in wild types, is greatly reduced along the dorsal midline where the notochord normally forms. This suggests that the protein is required for maintaining transcription of its own gene.</str>

Injection of B304 mRNA led to formation of neural structures in animal cap explants. Examination of molecular markers in B304-injected explants shows expression of anterior neural markers in the absence of mesodermal markers, indicating that B304 can cause neuralization without the mediation of mesoderm.

Complete loss of T has been shown to lead to embryonic lethality around E10.0. Here we characterize an inducible miRNA-based in vivo knockdown mouse model of T, termed KD3-T, which exhibits a hypomorphic phenotype. KD3-T embryos display axial skeletal defects caused by apoptosis of paraxial mesoderm, which is accompanied by urorectal malformations resembling the murine uro-recto-caudal syndrome and human caudal regression syndrome phenotypes. We show that there is a reduction of T in the notochord of KD3-T embryos which results in impaired notochord differentiation and its subsequent loss, whereas levels of T in the tailbud are sufficient for axis extension and patterning. Furthermore, the notochord in KD3-T embryos adopts a neural character and loses its ability to act as a signaling center. Since KD3-T animals survive until birth, they are useful for examining later roles for T in the development of urorectal tissues.</str>

      <str>Brachyury (T) mutant embryos are deficient in mesoderm formation and do not complete axial development. The notochord is most strongly affected. The T gene is expressed transiently in primitive streak-derived nascent and migrating mesoderm cells and continuously in the notochord. Ectopic expression of T protein in the animal cap of Xenopus embryos results in ectopic mesoderm formation. The T protein is located in the nucleus. These and other data suggested that the T gene might be involved in the control of transcriptional regulation. In an attempt to demonstrate specific DNA binding of the T protein we have identified a consensus sequence among DNA fragments selected from a mixture of random oligomers. Under our experimental conditions T protein binds as a monomer to DNA. This property resides in the N-terminal domain of 229 amino acid residues which is strongly conserved between the mouse protein, and its Xenopus and zebrafish homologues. The latter proteins also recognize the consensus DNA binding site. We suggest that the T protein is involved in the control of genes required for mesoderm formation, and for the differentiation and function of chorda mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells can differentiate into various cell types depending on culture conditions. Here we show that the expression of the mesodermal genes Brachyury (Bra) and Goosecoid (Gsc) are under regulatory control in P19 cells. When P19 cells were cultured in a tissue culture dish in the presence of serum, Bra and Gsc were unexpectedly expressed. Expression of Bra and Gsc was greatly reduced with culture time, and expression levels at 144 h of culture were below 25% those at 48 h of culture. Members of the Tgf-beta family such as Activin and Nodal have been known to up-regulate expression of mesodermal genes. Treatment with SB431542, an Alk4/5/7 inhibitor, decreased Bra and Gsc in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it induced the expression of the neuroectodermal genes Mash-1 and Pax-6. Quantitative RT-PCR and dsRNAi transfection indicated Nodal as a possible ligand responsible for the regulation of Bra and Gsc. In addition, exogenous Nodal increased expression of Bra and Gsc in a dose-dependent manner. Serum concentration in culture medium positively related to expression of Nodal, Bra, Gsc, and Cripto, which encodes a membrane-tethered protein required for Nodal signaling. Addition of the culture supernatant of P19 cells at 144 h of culture to medium decreased expression of these genes. The present study reveals that stimulation and inhibition of the Nodal pathway increases mesodermal genes and neuroectodermal genes, respectively, indicating the importance of control of Nodal and Cripto expression for mesodermal formation and neurogenesis.</str>

Interestingly, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is the only syndrome in which the incidence of chordomas has been described.

In this study, we investigated whether aberrant TSC/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is associated with sporadic chordomas.</str>

In the present study, 2 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMCs), 6 chordomas, 6 chondrosarcomas, 3 myxoid chondrosarcomas of bone, 2 osteochondromas, 6 chondroblastomas, and 2 nonneoplastic adult articular cartilages were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies against tau proteins and tubulin.

Although tubulin was detected in chondroblastomas (5/6), osteochondromas (2/2), chondrosarcomas (5/6), and myxoid-chondrosarcomas of bone (3/3), tau expression was absent in these tumors. The perichondrial chondroblasts but not chondrocytes from nonneoplastic articular cartilage also localize tau and tubulin with a much weaker staining intensity.

The function of these proteins as transcription factors is mediated by heterodimerization with the small bHLHZip protein Max, which is required for their specific DNA binding to E-box sequences. We have identified a novel Max-interacting protein, Mga, which contains a Myc-like bHLHZip motif, but otherwise shows no relationship with Myc or other Max-interacting proteins. Like Myc, Mad and Mnt proteins, Mga requires heterodimerization with Max for binding to the preferred Myc-Max-binding site CACGTG. In addition to the bHLHZip domain, Mga contains a second DNA-binding domain: the T-box or T-domain. The T-domain is a highly conserved DNA-binding motif originally defined in Brachyury and characteristic of the Tbx family of transcription factors. Mga binds the preferred Brachyury-binding sequence and represses transcription of reporter genes containing promoter-proximal Brachyury-binding sites. Surprisingly, Mga is converted to a transcription activator of both Myc-Max and Brachyury site-containing reporters in a Max-dependent manner. Our results suggest that Mga functions as a dual-specificity transcription factor that regulates the expression of both Max-network and T-box family target genes.</str>

      <str>General mechanisms initiating the gastrulation process in early animal development are still elusive, not least because embryonic morphology differs widely among species. The rabbit embryo is revived here as a model to study vertebrate gastrulation, because its relatively simple morphology at the appropriate stages makes interspecific differences and similarities particularly obvious between mammals and birds. Three approaches that centre on mesoderm specification as a key event at the start of gastrulation were chosen. (1) A cDNA fragment encoding 212 amino acids of the rabbit Brachyury gene was cloned by RT-PCR and used as a molecular marker for mesoderm progenitors. Whole-mount in situ hybridisation revealed single Brachyury-expressing cells in the epiblast at 6.2 days post conception, i.e. several hours before the first ingressing mesoderm cells can be detected histologically. With the anterior marginal crescent as a landmark, these mesoderm progenitors are shown to lie in a posterior quadrant of the embryonic disc, which we call the posterior gastrula extension (PGE), for reasons established during the following functional analysis. (2) Vital dye (DiI) labelling in vitro suggests that epiblast cells arrive in the PGE from anterior parts of the embryonic disc and then move within this area in a complex pattern of posterior, centripetal and anterior directions to form the primitive streak. (3) BrdU labelling shows that proliferation is reduced in the PGE, while the remaining anterior part of the embryonic disc contains several areas of increased proliferation. These results reveal similarities with the chick with respect to Brachyury expression and cellular migration. They differ, however, in that local differences in proliferation are not seen in the pre-streak avian embryo. Rather, rabbit epiblast cells start mesoderm differentiation in a way similar to Drosophila, where a transient downregulation of proliferation initiates mesoderm differentiation and, hence, gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Transcription factor Oct4 is expressed in pluripotent cell lineages during mouse development, namely, in inner cell mass (ICM), primitive ectoderm, and primordial germ cells. Functional studies have revealed that Oct4 is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in inner cell mass and for the survival of primordial germ cells. However, the function of Oct4 in the primitive ectoderm has not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the role of Oct4 in mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which exhibit molecular and developmental properties similar to the primitive ectoderm, as an in vitro model. Knockdown of Oct4 in P19 EC cells upregulated several early mesoderm-specific genes, such as Wnt3, Sp5, and Fgf8, by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Overexpression of Oct4 was sufficient to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling through its action as a transcriptional activator. However, Brachyury, a key regulator of early mesoderm development and a known direct target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, was unable to be upregulated in the absence of Oct4, even with additional activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Microarray analysis revealed that Oct4 positively regulated the expression of Tdgf1, a critical component of Nodal signaling, which was required for the upregulation of Brachyury in response to Wnt/β-catenin signaling in P19 EC cells. We propose a model that Oct4 maintains pluripotency of P19 EC cells through 2 counteracting actions: one is to suppress mesoderm-inducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the other is to provide competence to Brachyury gene to respond to Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</str>

Polyclonal serum was generated to LvBrac in order to characterize protein expression. LvBrac initially appears at mesenchyme blastula stage in two distinct regions with embryonic expression perduring until pluteus stage. Vegetally, LvBrac expression is in endoderm and lies circumferentially around the blastopore. This torus-shaped area of LvBrac expression remains constant in size as endoderm cells express LvBrac upon moving into that circumference and cease LvBrac expression as they leave the circumference. Vegetal expression remains around the anus through pluteus stage. The second domain of LvBrac expression first appears broadly in the oral ectoderm at mesenchyme blastula stage and at later embryonic stages is refined to just the stomodael opening. Vegetal LvBrac expression depends on autonomous beta-catenin signaling in macromeres and does not require micromere or veg2-inductive signals. It was then determined that LvBrac is necessary for the morphogenetic movements occurring in both expression regions. A dominant-interfering construct was generated by fusing the DNA binding domain of LvBrac to the transcriptional repression module of the Drosophila Engrailed gene in order to perturb gene function. Microinjection of mRNA encoding this LvBrac-EN construct resulted in a block in gastrulation movements but not expression of endoderm and mesoderm marker genes. Furthermore, injection of LvBrac-EN into one of two blastomeres resulted in normal gastrulation movements of tissues derived from the injected blastomere, indicating that LvBrac downstream function may be nonautonomous during sea urchin gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Intervertebral disc (IVD) disorder and age-related degeneration are believed to contribute to low back pain. Cell-based therapies represent a promising strategy to treat disc degeneration; however, the cellular and molecular characteristics of disc cells during IVD maturation and aging still remain poorly defined. This study investigated novel molecular markers and their age-related changes in the rat IVD. Affymetrix cDNA microarray analysis was conducted to identify a new set of genes characterizing immature nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Among these markers, select neuronal-related proteins (Basp1, Ncdn and Nrp-1), transcriptional factor (Brachyury T), and cell surface receptors (CD24, CD90, CD155 and CD221) were confirmed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for differential expression between IVD tissue regions and among various ages (1, 12 and 21 months). NP cells generally possessed higher levels of mRNA or protein expression for all aforementioned markers, with the exception of CD90 in anulus fibrosus (AF) cells. In addition, CD protein (CD24 and CD90) and Brachyury (T) expression in immature disc cells were also confirmed via flow cytometry. Similar to IHC staining, results revealed a higher percentage of immature NP cells expressing CD24 and Brachyury, while higher percentage of immature AF cells was stained positively for CD90. Altogether, this study identifies that tissue-specific gene expression and age-related differential expression of the above markers do exist in immature and aged disc cells. These age-related phenotype changes provide a new insight for a molecular profile that may be used to characterize NP cells for developing cell-based regenerative therapy for IVD regeneration.</str>

      <str>Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) plays a key role in mesoderm formation during early development. One factor thought to be involved in the regulation of Xbra is XSIP1, a zinc finger/homeodomain-like DNA-binding protein that belongs to the deltaEF1 family of transcriptional repressors. We show here that Xbra and XSIP1 are co-expressed at the onset of gastrulation, but that expression subsequently refines such that Xbra is expressed in prospective mesoderm and XSIP1 in anterior neurectoderm. This refinement of the expression patterns of the two genes is due in part to the ability of XSIP1 to repress expression of Xbra. This repression is highly specific, in the sense that XSIP1 does not repress the expression of other regionally expressed genes in the early embryo, and that other members of the family to which XSIP1 belongs, such as deltaEF1 and its Xenopus homologue ZEB, cannot regulate Xbra expression. The function of XSIP1 was studied further by making an interfering construct comprising the open reading frame of XSIP1 fused to the VP16 transactivation domain. Experiments using this chimeric protein suggest that XSIP1 is required for normal gastrulation movements to occur and for the development of the anterior neural plate.</str>

      <str>We have used a functional assay to identify a putative T-box transcription factor (Xombi) that has the ability to induce sites of invagination in the ectoderm of Xenopus embryos that resemble the blastopore lip. Maternal Xombi transcript is first localized to the oocyte's vegetal cortex and cytoplasm, early sources of mesoderm and endoderm-inducing signals. Soon after zygotic transcription begins, there is a wave of Xombi expression, beginning in dorsal mesoderm and then extending to lateral and ventral mesoderm, that precedes and parallels blastopore lip formation at the border between the mesoderm and endoderm. Transcripts encoding brachyury, Xwnt8 and goosecoid colocalize with Xombi transcripts within the marginal zone; ectopic expression of Xombi induces expression of all three mesodermal genes. In ectodermal explants, Xombi expression is induced by the secreted mesoderm inducers activinA, activinB, Xnrl and eFGF, and by brachyury, another Xenopus T-box containing gene. The time course and location of Xombi expression, its biological activities and the partial dependence of Xombi expression and blastopore lip formation on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling suggest that Xombi contributes to a traveling wave of morphogenesis and differentiation during Xenopus gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Organizer activity, once thought to be restricted to vertebrates, has ancient origins. However, among non-bilaterians, it has only been subjected to detailed investigation during embryonic development of the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. As a step toward establishing the extent to which findings in Nematostella can be generalized across the large and diverse phylum Cnidaria, we examined the expression of some key organizer and gastrulation genes during the embryonic development of the coral Acropora millepora. Although anemones and corals both belong to the cnidarian class Anthozoa, the two lineages diverged during the Cambrian and the morphological development of Acropora differs in several important respects from that of Nematostella. While the expression patterns of the key genes brachyury, bmp2/4, chordin, goosecoid and forkhead are broadly similar, developmental differences between the two species enable novel observations, and new interpretations of their significance. Specifically, brachyury expression during the flattened prawnchip stage before gastrulation, a developmental peculiarity of Acropora, leads us to suggest that it is the key gene demarcating ectoderm from endoderm in Acropora, and by implication in other cnidarians, whereas previous studies in Nematostella proposed that forkhead plays this role. Other novel observations include the transient expression of Acropora forkhead in scattered ectodermal cells shortly after gastrulation, and in the developing mesenterial filaments, with no corresponding expression reported in Nematostella. In addition, the expression patterns of goosecoid and bmp2/4 confirm the fundamental bilaterality of the Anthozoa. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are locally destructive tumors with high rates of recurrence and a poor prognosis. The mechanisms involved in chordoma recurrence remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the proteomic profile of a chordoma primary tumor (CSO) and a recurrent tumor (CSR) through mass spectrum in a chordoma patient who underwent surgery. Bioinformatic analysis of the profile showed that 359 proteins had a significant expression difference and 21 pathways had a striking alteration between the CSO and the CSR. The CSR showed a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed that the cancer stem cell marker activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM or CD166) expression level was higher in the recurrent than that in the primary tumor. The present study analyzed the proteomic profile change between CSO and CSR and identified a new biomarker ALCAM in recurrent chordomas. This finding sheds light on unraveling the pathophysiology of chordoma recurrence and on exploring more effective prognostic biomarkers and targeted therapies against this devastating disease.</str>

Using immunohistochemical techniques, we investigated the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-1, -2, and -9; tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs)-1 and -2; cathepsin B (CatB); urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA); and plasminogen activator inhibitor, type I (PAI1), in 45 patients with skull base chordoma (45 primary and 25 autologous recurrent lesions). We compared these data with clinicopathologic parameters and the expression of cell differentiation markers. MMP-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1, CatB, uPA, and PAI1 were frequently expressed, and there was a significant correlation in the expression of some proteinases. Immunoreactivity for MMP-1, MMP-2, CatB, and uPA was significantly higher in lesions exhibiting tumor infiltration of host bone than in those without such components. Expression of MMP-1, TIMP-1, CatB, and uPA was associated with that of low-molecular-weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2). There were no differences in proteinase expression in 25 pairs of primary and their recurrent lesions, and proteinase expression did not predict local recurrences. However, patients with higher expression of both MMP-1 and uPA showed worse prognosis compared with the others. In conclusion, expression of some proteinases correlated with CAM5.2 expression and seemed to play an important role in a synergistic manner in the invasion process in skull base chordoma. The authors believe that elevated expression of MMP-1 and uPA can be used to identify patients with a worse prognosis in skull base chordoma.</str>

      <str>The expression patterns of Brachyury (Bra) orthologs in the development of four species of sand dollars (order: Clypeasteroida), including a direct-developing species, and of a sea urchin species (order: Echinoida) were investigated during the period from blastula to the pluteus stage, with special attention paid to the relationship between the expression pattern and the mode of gastrulation. The sand dollar species shared two expression domains of the Bra orthologs with the Echinoida species, in the vegetal ring (the first domain) and the oral ectoderm (the second domain). The following heterotopic changes in the expression of the Bra genes were found among the sand dollar species and between the sand dollars and the Echinoida species. (1) The vegetal ring expressing Bra in the sand dollars was much wider and was located at a higher position along the AV axis, compared with that in the Echinoida species. The characteristic Bra expression in the vegetal ring of the sand dollar embryos was thought to be involved in the mode of gastrulation, in which involution continues from the beginning of invagination until the end of gastrulation. (2) Two of the three indirect-developing sand dollar species that were examined exhibited a third domain, in which Bra was expressed on the oral side of the archenteron. (3) In the direct-developing sand dollar embryos, Bra was expressed with an oral-aboral asymmetry in the vegetal ring and with a left-right asymmetry in the oral ectoderm. In the Echinoida species, Bra was expressed in the vestibule at the six-armed pluteus stage.</str>

      <str>The continued turn over of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) while maintaining an undifferentiated state is dependent on the regulation of the cell cycle. Here we asked the question if a single cell cycle gene could regulate the self-renewal or pluripotency properties of hESC. We identified that the protein expression of the p27(Kip)¹ cell cycle inhibitor is low in hESC cells and increased with differentiation. By adopting a gain and loss of function strategy we forced or reduced its expression in undifferentiating conditions to define its functional role in self-renewal and pluripotency. Using undifferentiation conditions, overexpression of p27(Kip)¹ in hESC lead to a G₁phase arrest with an enlarged and flattened hESC morphology and consequent loss of self-renewal ability. Loss of p27(Kip)¹ caused an elongated/scatter cell-like phenotype involving up-regulation of Brachyury and Twist gene expression. We demonstrate the novel finding that p27(Kip)¹ protein occupies the Twist1 gene promoter and manipulation of p27(Kip)¹ by gain and loss of function is associated with Twist gene expression changes. These results define p27(Kip)¹ expression levels as critical for self-renewal and pluripotency in hESC and suggest a role for p27(Kip)¹ in controlling an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hESC.</str>

      <str>Bilateria are subdivided into Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Indirect development through primary, ciliary larvae occurs in both of these branches; however, the closing blastopore develops into mouth and anus in Protostomia and into anus only in Deuterostomia. Because of this important difference in larval gut ontogeny, the tube-shaped guts in protostome and deuterostome primary larvae are thought to have evolved independently. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed the expression of brachyury, otx and goosecoid homologues in the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii, which develops by means of a trochophora larva-the primary, ciliary larva prototypic for Protostomia. Here we show that brachyury expression in the ventral portion of the developing foregut in Platynereis and also otx expression along ciliated bands in the mouth region of the trochophora larva parallels expression in primary larvae in Deuterostomia. In addition, goosecoid expression in the foregut of Platynereis mirrors the function in higher Deuterostomia. We present molecular evidence for the evolutionary conservation of larval foreguts and mouth regions of Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Our data indicate that Urbilateria, the common bilaterian ancestors, developed through a primary, ciliary larva that already possessed a tripartite tube-shaped gut.</str>

      <str>The murine Brachyury (T) gene is required in posterior mesoderm formation and axial development. Mutant embryos lacking T gene function are deficient in notochord differentiation and posterior mesoderm formation, but make anterior mesoderm. Posterior axial development requires increasing T activity along the rostrocaudal axis. The T gene is transiently transcribed in nascent and migrating mesoderm and continuously in the notochord. The maintenance of T expression in the notochord depends, directly or indirectly, on wild-type T activity. In Xenopus it has been shown that the onset of T expression occurs in response to mesoderm-inducing growth factors. The T protein is binding to DNA and is probably involved in the control of gene expression. Here we show that the T protein is located in the nucleus. We have analyzed the expression pattern of T protein in wild-type and mutant embryos from early primitive streak formation to the end of the tail bud stage. Throughout all stages of mesoderm formation T protein is transiently present in nascent and migrating mesoderm. In the notochord T protein persists to the end of the tail bud stage. It is also transiently detectable in the forming gut endoderm and in prospective neuroectoderm of later embryos. This shows that T expression is not strictly correlated with a commitment of cells to mesoderm. The analysis of the tail development of TWis/+ mutant embryos demonstrated that the formation of the neural tube, gut, and somites from the tail bud proceeds in the absence of a notochord. The maintenance and differentiation of these structures, however, seems to depend on signals from the notochord.</str>

      <str>Because of their extremely simple body plan, dicyemids have long been the subject of phylogenetic controversy, regarding whether their body plan reflects their primitiveness or a degeneration from complex metazoans. Several studies have argued that the simple body plan of dicyemids are likely secondarily derived from higher lophotrochozoan animals, as a result of their endoparasitic, or endosymbiotic, lifestyle in the cephalopod kidney. To clarify the evolution of their simple body plan, we investigated the developmental expression patterns of three important regulatory genes, the central type Hox gene (DoxC), otx, and brachyury homologs in the dicyemid mesozoa, Dicyema orientale. DoxC was expressed in the trunk and tail of the asexually developing vermiform embryo, with clear anterior boundaries. Do-otx was expressed in the vegetal pole cells of the developing infusoriform embryos, suggesting that the invagination in infusoriform embryo is homologous to the gastrulation of other metazoans. Do-bra is expressed in the presumptive ventral cells, which are ventral to the opening of the urn cavity. The expression of Do-bra suggests that the urn cavity opening of the infusoriform embryo is comparable to the stomodium of trochophore larvae. These gene expression patterns provide molecular clues to trace the evolutionary history of degeneration in the dicyemid embryogenesis and life cycle from those of ancestral lophotrochozoan animals.</str>

      <str>Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which demethylates mono- and dimethylated histone H3-Lys4 as part of a complex including CoREST and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is essential for embryonic development in the mouse beyond embryonic day 6.5 (e6.5). To determine the role of LSD1 during this early period of embryogenesis, we have generated loss-of-function gene trap mice and conditional knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells. Analysis of postimplantation gene trap embryos revealed that LSD1 expression, and therefore function, is restricted to the epiblast. Conditional deletion of LSD1 in mouse ES cells, the in vitro counterpart of the epiblast, revealed a reduction in CoREST protein and associated HDAC activity, resulting in a global increase in histone H3-Lys56 acetylation, but not H3-Lys4 methylation. Despite this biochemical perturbation, ES cells with LSD1 deleted proliferate normally and retain stem cell characteristics. Loss of LSD1 causes the aberrant expression of 588 genes, including those coding for transcription factors with roles in anterior/posterior patterning and limb development, such as brachyury, Hoxb7, Hoxd8, and retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ). The gene coding for brachyury, a key regulator of mesodermal differentiation, is a direct target gene of LSD1 and is overexpressed in e6.5 Lsd1 gene trap embryos. Thus, LSD1 regulates the expression and appropriate timing of key developmental regulators, as part of the LSD1/CoREST/HDAC complex, during early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>Detailed in situ analyses reveal overlapping expression of gsc and Xbra in the early Spemann's organizer. Coexpression is lost during gastrulation suggesting an interaction between these genes. Ectopic expression of gsc ventrally suppresses endogenous Xbra expression and transcription from Xbra promoter reporter gene constructs. Suppression is mediated, at least partially, by a gsc-binding site within the first 349 bp of the promoter. Xbra reporter gene transcription is also suppressed in the region of endogenous gsc expression, whereas high-level ectopic Xbra expression has no effect on endogenous gsc expression. We suggest that early patterning of the vertebrate mesoderm, like early patterning of the Drosophila embryo, occurs by first establishing broad domains of gene expression which are subsequently refined by intergenic interactions to further delimit tissue boundaries.</str>

In occasional cases, because the tumors often expand slowly, months or years may pass between the first clinical symptoms and diagnosis. Diagnostic problems exist in differentiating these chordomas from pleomorphic adenoma, mucinous carcinoma, or chondrosarcoma. Ten relevant observations of typical cranial and cervical chordomas (Salivary Gland Register Hamburg 1965-1996) were analyzed more closely by pathohistological and immunohistochemical means. The exact diagnosis is based upon the evidence of blown-up, bubble-like ("physaliform") cells which contain mucus drops in a vacuolized cytoplasm and are surrounded by extensive areas of mucoid mucus. The pattern of immunohistochemistry is characterized by the multifold expression of cytokeratin, vimentin, and EMA.

Additionally, rare isolated embryonic notochord cells remained in the vertebral column and resembled "notochordal remnants," which in humans have been proposed to give rise to a rare type of late-onset cancer called chordoma. Previously, this cell type had not been identified in the mouse model system. The development and characterization of a mouse model that can be used to fate map nucleus pulposus precursor cells in any mutant background will be useful for uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of disk degeneration. In addition, the identification of notochordal remnants in mice is the first step towards generating an in vivo model of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Posterior neuropore (PNP) closure coincides with the end of gastrulation, marking the end of primary neurulation and primary body axis formation. Secondary neurulation and axis formation involve differentiation of the tail bud mesenchyme. Genetic control of the primary-secondary transition is not understood. We report a detailed analysis of gene expression in the caudal region of day 10 mouse embryos during primary neuropore closure. Embryos were collected at the 27-32 somite stage, fixed, processed for whole mount in situ hybridisation, and subsequently sectioned for a more detailed analysis. Genes selected for study include those involved in the key events of gastrulation and neurulation at earlier stages and more cranial levels. Patterns of expression within the tail bud, neural plate, recently closed neural tube, notochord, hindgut, mesoderm, and surface ectoderm are illustrated and described. Specifically, we report continuity of expression of the genes Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Evx1, Fgf8, RARgamma, Brachyury, and Hoxb1 from primitive streak and node into subpopulations of the tail bud and caudal axial structures. Within the caudal notochord, developing floorplate, and hindgut, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, Shh, and Brachyury expression domains correlate directly with known genetic roles and predicted tissue interdependence during induction and differentiation of these structures. The patterns of expression of Wnt5a, Hoxb1, Brachyury, RARgamma, and Evx1, together with observations on proliferation, reveal that the caudal mesoderm is organised at a molecular level into distinct domains delineated by longitudinal and transverse borders before histological differentiation. Expression of Wnt5a in the ventral ectodermal ridge supports previous evidence that this structure is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. These results provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms facilitating transition from primary to secondary body axis formation, as well as the factors involved in defective spinal neurulation.</str>

      <str>The development of in vitro methods for regulatory embryotoxicity testing is challenging since the understanding of chemical effects on the mammalian development is still poor. The aim of the project is to identify marker genes during in vitro cell differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells, in order to predict chemical effects on cell differentiation of specific target tissues. The present study is focusing on the expression pattern by using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR of key genes involved in cardiomyocytes development; i.e. Oct-4, Brachyury, Nkx2.5 and alpha myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC). Two reference chemicals with well-known in vivo data have been analysed by using this approach: retinoic acid and lithium chloride. Retinoic acid has been selected as a teratogen affecting several target tissues, whereas lithium chloride has been described to affect the development of the cardiovascular system. We demonstrate that retinoic acid already affects in the early stage of germ layer formation, which was demonstrated by a change of Oct-4 and Brachyury gene expression. As we expected, the expression of cardiac specific genes (Nkx2.5, alpha-MHC) has been also modified. In contrary, the Oct-4 and Brachyury expression was not changed by lithium treatment. In this case, we observed a modification in the normal gene expression pattern, for alpha-MHC and Nkx2.5, demonstrating that lithium chloride affects the later stage of heart development. These data suggest that the inclusion of selective target organ genes in an established embryotoxicity test allows to predict effects of chemicals and drugs to the heart development.</str>

      <str>To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the alterations of G(1)-S checkpoint and their significance in chordoma, a rare bone tumor. The authors investigated the clinicopathologic relevance of cell cycle abnormalities in chordoma.</str>
      <str>The expression levels of p53, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), retinoblastoma protein (pRb), cyclin D1, p16(INK4a), and p27(Kip1) were investigated using immunohistochemical techniques; p53 mutations were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism, and mdm2 amplification was analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. The results were compared with clinicopathologic parameters in 101 lesions.</str>
      <str>Approximately 10-45% of primary tumors presented alterations of p53, MDM2, cyclin D1, and pRb proteins; most tumors lacked expression of p16(INK4a) and p27(Kip1). Alterations of p53, MDM2, cyclin D1, and pRb proteins were found to have cooperative effects on both higher proliferative ability (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]) and increased nuclear pleomorphism, a previously described prognostic indicator for patients with chordoma. Multivariate analyses revealed that, among these alterations, p53 overexpression was the only independent factor for higher MIB-1 LI. At the genetic level, mdm2 gene amplification was detected in 15.4% of the lesions but did not correlate with MDM2 overexpression or other clinicopathologic parameters. No p53 mutations were detected in the current series. Survival analysis revealed that p53 overexpression, but no other cell cycle alterations, was associated with a reduced overall survival.</str>
      <str>Accumulation of cell cycle alterations led to an increased MIB-1 LI and nuclear pleomorphism, a previously described prognostic indicator in chordoma. The authors believe that p53 overexpression in particular is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with chordoma.</str>

      <str>We demonstrate that the nuclear, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Xbra causes dorsal mesodermal differentiation of animal cap ectoderm when co-expressed with the secreted proteins noggin and Xwnt-8. None of these molecules causes dorsal mesoderm formation when expressed alone. Co-expression of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) mRNA with noggin mRNA in animal caps specifies the main dorsal tissues, namely muscle, notochord and neural tissue. Co-expression of Xbra with Xwnt-8, in contrast, converts animal caps to muscle masses. We have previously shown that expression of Xbra alone in animal caps is sufficient to specify ventral mesoderm which expresses Xhox3 and low levels of muscle-specific actin. We now conclude that the putative transcription factor Xbra defines a cell state in the vertebrate embryo which can respond to diffusible dorsal signals such as noggin and Xwnt-8, resulting in dorsal mesodermal differentiation. In the absence of such dorsal signals Xbra causes ventral mesodermal differentiation. This state is only partially maintained after the mid-blastula transition as it permits the dorsal response to zygotically expressed noggin but it does not allow a dorsal response to zygotically expressed Xwnt-8, which elicits only ventral mesodermal differentiation.</str>

      <str>The Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, is expressed in the presumptive mesoderm of the early gastrula. Induction of Xbra in animal pole tissue by activin occurs only in a narrow window of activin concentrations; if the level of inducer is too high, or too low, the gene is not expressed. Previously, we have suggested that the suppression of Xbra by high concentrations of activin is due to the action of genes such as goosecoid and Mix.1. Here, we examine the roles played by goosecoid and Mix.1 during normal development, first in the control of Xbra expression and then in the formation of the mesendoderm. Consistent with the model outlined above, inhibition of the function of either gene product leads to transient ectopic expression of Xbra. Such embryos later develop dorsoanterior defects and, in the case of interference with Mix.1, additional defects in heart and gut formation. Goosecoid, a transcriptional repressor, appears to act directly on transcription of Xbra. In contrast, Mix.1, which functions as a transcriptional activator, may act on Xbra indirectly, in part through activation of goosecoid.</str>

      <str>Extrinsic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal and intrinsic factors that determine the response of the signal-receiving blastomeres to FGF regulate mesoderm patterning in embryos of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. To investigate how cells integrate information from extrinsic and intrinsic inputs, we examined Brachyury (Hr-Bra) promoter activity in the early embryo. Hr-Bra, which encodes a key transcription factor for notochord development, is expressed exclusively in notochord precursors in a manner dependent on the FGF-MEK-MAPK-Ets signaling pathway and on the intrinsic factors Zic and FoxA. Reporter gene expression driven by the 900-bp upstream region of the Hr-Bra promoter was detected as early as the 110-cell stage in notochord precursors by in situ hybridization with a LacZ probe. Deletion analysis combined with MEK inhibitor treatment demonstrated that the -598/-499 region carries FGF-responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified three Ets-binding sites in this region that were required for promoter activity. Further deletion analysis conducted by injecting eggs with reporter constructs at higher concentration suggested that the -398/-289 region also has enhancer activity, although ectopic reporter expression was detected in nerve cord and endoderm precursors. The -398/-289 region has a Zic-binding site that was also essential for the enhancer activity. These results indicate that Ets- and Zic-binding sites are critical for the initiation of Hr-Bra expression. In conclusion, information from both extrinsic and intrinsic factors is integrated at the level of enhancer of the target gene by direct binding of the transcription factors to the enhancer region.</str>

      <str>Ligand-bound nuclear receptors (NRs) recruit cofactors such as members of the p160 family and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to activate transcription. We have cloned the Xenopus homologue of the human transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), a member of the p160 family of cofactors. Xenopus TIF2 (XTIF2) mRNA is expressed homogeneously during late blastula-early gastrula stages and later becomes highly expressed in the notochord. To study the function of XTIF2 during development, we have used two dominant negative constructs, one encompassing the NR-binding domain and the other the CBP interacting region of XTIF2. Overexpression of the XTIF2 dominant negative mRNAs causes ectopic expression of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) and MyoD in all tissue layers. Moreover, ectopic expression of the dominant negative construct that contains the CBP-binding region produces strong phenotypes at hatching stage such as loss of head structures, shortened trunks and open blastopores, which can be rescued by XTIF2 coexpression. These observed defects are due, at least in part, to repression of dorsal mesoderm and endoderm genes. Our data suggest the existence of a NR pathway that requires XTIF2 and CBP to repress Xbra and XMyoD.</str>

      <str>BMP is thought to induce hESC differentiation toward multiple lineages including mesoderm and trophoblast. The BMP-induced trophoblast phenotype is a long-standing paradox in stem cell biology. Here we readdressed BMP function in hESCs and mouse epiblast-derived cells. We found that BMP4 cooperates with FGF2 (via ERK) to induce mesoderm and to inhibit endoderm differentiation. These conditions induced cells with high levels of BRACHYURY (BRA) that coexpressed CDX2. BRA was necessary for and preceded CDX2 expression; both genes were essential for expression not only of mesodermal genes but also of trophoblast-associated genes. Maximal expression of the latter was seen in the absence of FGF but these cells coexpressed mesodermal genes and moreover they differed in cell surface and epigenetic properties from placental trophoblast. We conclude that BMP induces human and mouse pluripotent stem cells primarily to form mesoderm, rather than trophoblast, acting through BRA and CDX2.</str>

      <str>The transcription factor Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) plays an essential role in notochord development in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. We characterized a putative Ci-Bra target gene, which we named Ci-multidom, and analyzed in detail its expression pattern in normal embryos and in embryos where Ci-Bra was misexpressed. Ci-multidom encodes a novel protein, which contains eight CCP domains and a partial VWFA domain. We show that an EGFP-multidom fusion protein localizes preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is excluded from the nucleus. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that Ci-multidom is expressed in the notochord and in the anterior neural boundary (ANB). We found that the expression in the ANB is fully recapitulated by an enhancer element located upstream of Ci-multidom. By means of misexpression experiments, we provide evidence that Ci-Bra controls transcription of Ci-multidom in the notochord; however, while Ci-Bra is homogeneously expressed throughout this structure, Ci-multidom is transcribed at detectable levels only in a random subset of notochord cells. The number of notochord cells expressing Ci-multidom varies among different embryos and is independent of developmental stage, lineage, and position along the anterior-posterior axis. These results suggest that despite its morphological simplicity and invariant cell-lineage, the ancestral notochord is a mosaic of cells in which the gene cascade downstream of Brachyury is differentially modulated.</str>

      <str>To analyse the roles of FGF activity and brachyury during gastrulation we have directly compared the consequences of inhibition of FGF-receptor signalling with the phenotype of the zebrafish brachyury mutant, no tail (ntl). We show that expression of ntl is regulated by FGF and that inhibition of FGF receptor-signalling leads to complete loss of the trunk and tail. Since the ntl mutant lacks the tail and notochord but has an otherwise normal trunk, this demonstrates that trunk development is dependent upon an unidentified gene, or set of genes, referred to as no trunk (ntk) which is regulated by FGF. We propose a model to explain the FGF-dependent regulation of ntl and ntk that accounts for the above phenotypes. Consistent with this model, over-expression of eFGF led to suppression of anterior fates and development of trunk and tail derivatives only. In addition, widespread activation of convergence and extension movements resulted in the formation of multiple axis-like structures. Expression of eve1 and cad1 was also regulated by FGF activity, suggesting that during gastrulation FGF activity is normally restricted to the germ ring where these genes, and ntl, are expressed. Taken together these data suggest that the germ ring acts as a posteriorising centre during AP patterning, mediated by FGF activity in this tissue.</str>

      <str>Classical embryology experiments have indicated the existence of dorsal-type and ventral-type mesoderms that arise as a consequence of mesoderm induction during vertebrate development. Here we report that the zebrafish tbx6 gene, a member of the Brachyury-related T-box family of genes, is exclusively expressed by ventral mesendoderm. Three observations link the expression of tbx6 to ventral mesoderm specification. First, the gene is initially expressed at the onset of gastrulation within a ventrolateral subpopulation of cells that express the pan-mesodermal gene, no tail (Brachyury). Second, the mesoderm-inducing factors activin and bFGF activate tbx6 expression in animal caps. Third, dorsalization of the mesendodermal precursor population following exposure of embryos to lithium ions causes down-regulation of tbx6 transcription. tbx6 is expressed transiently in the involuting derivatives of the ventral mesendoderm, which give rise to nonaxial mesodermal tissues; its expression is extinguished as tissue differentiation progresses. Transcription of tbx6 commences about an hour after initiation of expression of the pan-mesendodermal gene no tail and the organizer gene goosecoid. The dependence of tbx6 expression on no tail activity was examined in no tail mutant embryos. The activation of tbx6 transcription in ventral mesoderm does not depend on no tail gene activity. However, no tail appears to contribute to the maintenance of normal levels of tbx6 transcription and may be required for tbx6 transcription in the developing tail.</str>

      <str>The local invasiveness and occasional rapid growth of chordomas, despite optimal treatment, highlight the need to develop ways to predict their biologic behavior. Alterations in adhesion proteins have been shown to participate in proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in epithelial tumors. We therefore analyzed the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, as well as their cytosolic binding proteins alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, in 51 paraffin archived and 17 cryopreserved chordoma specimens. In the majority of chordomas, E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression was inversely correlated, whereas beta-catenin and gamma-catenin expression was directly correlated. By multivariate analysis, N-cadherin up-regulation correlated with a diminished recurrence-free survival, and E-cadherin down-regulation strongly correlated with increased probabilities of death as determined by the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. There was a 3.28-fold increased probability of having a tumor recurrence and a 10.98-fold increased probability of dying when, respectively, N-cadherin was up-regulated and E-cadherin down-regulated. These results suggest that changes in the relative expression of the cadherin-catenin complex reflect chordoma aggressiveness; and that decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of N-cadherin may underlie the transition from a less to a more aggressive tumor phenotype.</str>

      <str>Analysis of gene function in Xenopus development frequently involves over-expression experiments, in which RNA encoding the protein of interest is microinjected into the early embryo. By taking advantage of the fate map of Xenopus, it is possible to direct expression of the protein to particular regions of the embryo, but it has not been possible to exert control over the timing of expression; the protein is translated immediately after injection. To overcome this problem in our analysis of the role of Brachyury in Xenopus development, we have, like Kolm and Sive (1995; Dev. Biol. 171, 267-272), explored the use of hormone-inducible constructs. Animal pole regions derived from embryos expressing a fusion protein (Xbra-GR) in which the Xbra open reading frame is fused to the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor develop as atypical epidermis, presumably because Xbra is sequestered by the heat-shock apparatus of the cell. Addition of dexamethasone, which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and releases Xbra, causes formation of mesoderm. We have used this approach to investigate the competence of animal pole explants to respond to Xbra-GR, and have found that competence persists until late gastrula stages, even though by this time animal caps have lost the ability to respond to mesoderm-inducing factors such as activin and FGF. In a second series of experiments, we demonstrate that Xbra is capable of inducing its own expression, but that this auto-induction requires intercellular signals and FGF signalling. Finally, we suggest that the use of inducible constructs may assist in the search for target genes of Brachyury.</str>

      <str>The canonical, beta-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway is a crucial player in the early events of Xenopus development. Dorsal axis formation and mesoderm patterning are accepted effects of this pathway, but the regulation of expression of genes involved in mesoderm specification is not. This conclusion is based largely on the inability of the Wnt pathway to induce mesoderm in animal cap explants. Using injections of inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, we demonstrate that expression of the general mesodermal marker Brachyury (Xbra) requires a zygotic, ligand-dependent Wnt activity throughout the marginal zone. Analysis of the Xbra promoter reveals that putative TCF-binding sites mediate Wnt activation, the first sites in this well-studied promoter to which an activation role can be ascribed. However, established mesoderm inducers like eFGF and activin can bypass the Wnt requirement for Xbra expression. Another mesoderm promoting factor, VegT, activates Xbra in a Wnt-dependent manner. We also show that the activin/nodal signaling is necessary for ectopic Xbra induction by the Wnt pathway, but not by VegT. Our data significantly change the understanding of Brachyury regulation in Xenopus, implying the existence of an unknown zygotic Wnt ligand in Spemann's organizer. Since Brachyury is considered to have a major role in mesoderm formation, it is possible that Wnts might play a role in mesoderm specification, in addition to patterning.</str>

      <str>To reconstruct a minimum complement of notochord genes evolutionarily conserved across chordates, we scanned the Ciona intestinalis genome using the sequences of 182 genes reported to be expressed in the notochord of different vertebrates and identified 139 candidate notochord genes. For 66 of these Ciona genes expression data were already available, hence we analyzed the expression of the remaining 73 genes and found notochord expression for 20. The predicted products of the newly identified notochord genes range from the transcription factors Ci-XBPa and Ci-miER1 to extracellular matrix proteins. We examined the expression of the newly identified notochord genes in embryos ectopically expressing Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and in embryos expressing a repressor form of this transcription factor in the notochord, and we found that while a subset of the genes examined are clearly responsive to Ci-Bra, other genes are not affected by alterations in its levels. We provide a first description of notochord genes that are not evidently influenced by the ectopic expression of Ci-Bra and we propose alternative regulatory mechanisms that might control their transcription.</str>

      <str>Members of the T-box family of transcription factors share an evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding domain and play significant roles in various processes of embryonic development. Vertebrate T-box genes are categorized into the following five major subfamilies (eight groups), depending on sequence similarities: Brachyury, Tbx1 (Tbx1/10, Tbx15/18/22, Tbx20), Tbx2/3/4/5 (Tbx2/3 and Tbx4/5), Tbx6, and Tbr/Eomes/TBX21. Ascidians are primitive chordates, and their tadpole larva are considered to represent the simplified and basic body plan of vertebrates. In addition, it has been revealed that the ascidian genome contains the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in development. The present characterization of cDNAs and survey of the Ciona intestinalis draft genome demonstrated that the Ciona genome contains a single copy gene for each of the Brachyury, Tbx1/10, Tbx15/18/22, Tbx20, Tbx2/3, and Tbr/Eomes/TBX21 groups, and at least three copies of the Tbx6 subfamily. Each of the Ciona T-box genes shows a characteristic expression pattern, although that of Tbx20 was not determined in the present study. These results provide basic information that will be useful for future studies of the function of each gene, genetic cascades of different T-box genes, and genome-wide surveys of evolutionary changes in the T-box gene structure and organization in this primitive chordate.</str>

      <str>T-box gene family members have important roles during murine embryogenesis, gastrulation, and organogenesis. Although relatively little is known about how T-box genes are regulated, published gene expression studies have revealed dynamic and specific patterns in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues of the mouse conceptus. Mutant alleles of the T-box gene Brachyury (T) have identified roles in formation of mesoderm and its derivatives, such as somites and the allantois. However, given the cell autonomous nature of T gene activity and conflicting results of gene expression studies, it has been difficult to attribute a primary function to T in normal allantoic development. We report localization of T protein by sectional immunohistochemistry in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues during mouse gastrulation, emphasizing T localization within the allantois. T was detected in all previously reported sites within the conceptus, including the primitive streak and its derivatives, nascent embryonic mesoderm, the node and notochord, as well as notochord-associated endoderm and posterior neurectoderm. In addition, we have clarified T within the allantois, where it was first detected in the proximal midline of the late allantoic bud (approximately 7.5 days postcoitum, dpc) and persisted within an expanded midline domain until 6-somite pairs (s; approximately 8.5 dpc). Lastly, we have discovered several novel T sites, including the developing heart, visceral endoderm, extraembryonic ectoderm, and its derivative, chorionic ectoderm. Together, these data provide a unified picture of T in the mammalian conceptus, and demonstrate T's presence in unrelated cell types and tissues in highly dynamic spatiotemporal patterns in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues.</str>

      <str>We present evidence that the embryo of the ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, is an easily manipulated system for investigating the establishment of basic chordate tissues and organs. Ciona has a small genome, and simple, well-defined embyronic lineages. Here, we examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the notochord. Particular efforts center on the regulation of a notochord-specific Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra). An electroporation method was devised for the efficient incorporation of transgenic DNA into Ciona embryos. This method permitted the identification of a minimal, 434 bp enhancer from the Ci-Bra promoter region that mediates the notochord-restricted expression of both GFP and lacZ reporter genes. This enhancer contains a negative control region that excludes Ci-Bra expression from inappropriate embryonic lineages, including the trunk mesenchyme and tail muscles. Evidence is presented that the enhancer is activated by a regulatory element which is closely related to the recognition sequence of the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor, thereby raising the possibility that the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in notochord differentiation. We discuss the implications of this analysis with regard to the evolutionary conservation of integrative enhancers, and the subdivision of the axial and paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates.</str>

      <str>T-box genes are potent regulators of mesoderm development in many metazoans. In chordate embryos, the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (Bra) is required for specification and differentiation of the notochord. In some chordates, including the ascidian Ciona, members of the Tbx2 subfamily of T-box genes are also expressed in this tissue; however, their regulatory relationships with Bra and their contributions to the development of the notochord remain uncharacterized. We determined that the notochord expression of Ciona Tbx2/3 (Ci-Tbx2/3) requires Ci-Bra, and identified a Ci-Tbx2/3 notochord CRM that necessitates multiple Ci-Bra binding sites for its activity. Expression of mutant forms of Ci-Tbx2/3 in the developing notochord revealed a role for this transcription factor primarily in convergent extension. Through microarray screens, we uncovered numerous Ci-Tbx2/3 targets, some of which overlap with known Ci-Bra-downstream notochord genes. Among the Ci-Tbx2/3 notochord targets are evolutionarily conserved genes, including caspases, lineage-specific genes, such as Noto4, and newly identified genes, such as MLKL. This work sheds light on a large section of the notochord regulatory circuitry controlled by T-box factors, and reveals new components of the complement of genes required for the proper formation of this structure.</str>

      <str>Cellular self-organization studies have been mainly focused on models such as Volvox, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, and animal (metazoan) embryos. Moreover, animal tissues undergoing regeneration also exhibit properties of embryonic systems such as the self-organization process that rebuilds tissue complexity and function. We speculated that the recreation in vitro of the biological, biophysical, and biomechanical conditions similar to those of a regenerative milieu could elicit the intrinsic capacity of differentiated cells to proceed to the development of a tissue-like structure. Here we show that, when primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts are cultured in a soft nanofiber scaffold, they establish a cellular network that causes an organized cell contraction,proliferation, and migration that ends in the formation of a symmetrically bilateral structure with a distinct central axis. A subset of mesodermal genes (brachyury, Sox9, Runx2) is upregulated during this morphogenetic process. The expression of brachyury was localized first at the central axis, extending then to both sides of the structure. The spontaneous formation of cartilage-like tissue mainly at the paraxial zone followed expression ofSox9 and Runx2. Because cellular self-organization is an intrinsic property of the tissues undergoing development,this model could lead to new ways to consider tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</str>

      <str>Recently, physical factors in the local cellular microenvironment have been confirmed with strong influences on regulating stem cell fate. Despite the recent identification of the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) as a bioreactor for culturing stem cells, the underlying biological role provided by RCCS in the lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains largely undefined. Here, we explored the embryoid body (EB) formation and subsequent differentiation of mouse ESCs in RCCS. We demonstrated that EBs formed in RCCS were more homogeneous and bigger in size compared with those in the static condition. Further, we determined that mesendoderm differentiation was prominently enhanced, while neuroectodermal differentiation was significantly suppressed in RCCS. Surprisingly, we found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was greatly enhanced mainly due to the increased expression of Wnt3 during ESC differentiation in RCCS. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by DKK1 decreased the expression of Brachyury and attenuated mesendoderm differentiation in RCCS. Intriguingly, Wnt3a markedly increased Brachyury expression under static condition rather than in RCCS. Taken together, our findings uncover a new role of rotary suspension culture in initializing the early differentiation of ESCs. </str>

      <str>One major difference between simple metazoans such as cnidarians and all the bilaterian animals is thought to involve the invention of mesoderm. The terms diploblasts and triploblasts are therefore, often used to group prebilaterian and bilaterian animals, respectively. However, jellyfish contain well developed striated and smooth muscle tissues that derive from the entocodon, a mesoderm-like tissue formed during medusa development. We investigated the hypothesis, that the entocodon could be homologous to the third germ layer of bilaterians by analyzing the structures and expression patterns of the homologues of Brachyury, Mef2, and Snail in the jellyfish Podocoryne carnea. These are regulatory genes from the T-box, MADS-box and zinc finger families known to play important roles in bilaterian mesoderm patterning and muscle differentiation. The sequence and expression data demonstrate that the genes are structurally and functionally conserved and even more similar to humans or other deuterostomes than to protostome model organisms such as Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans. Based on these data we conclude that the common ancestor of the cnidarians and bilaterians not only shared genes that play a role in regulating myogenesis but already used them to develop and differentiate muscle systems similar to those of triploblasts.</str>

There was a tender abdomen, lumbar pain and conscious proprioceptive deficits in both pelvic limbs. Depressed pelvic limb reflexes were present consistent with a lower motor neuron lesion. In radiographs of the lumbar spine there was narrowing of the intervertebral disc space at L5-L6 with irregular, multifocal areas of mineralized opacities dorsal to the intervertebral disc space, presumably within the vertebral canal. On computed tomography, an intramedullary, partially mineralized mass was identified in the spinal cord at the level of caudal L5 through cranial L6. At necropsy there was a four-centimeter enlarged, irregular segment of spinal cord at the level of L5-L6. When sectioned, the spinal cord bad a mineralized texture. Histologically there were variable sized cells that were stellate in appearance with vacuolated cytoplasm (physaliferous cells) and mucinous background consistent with a chordoma. Chordoma is a rare, skeletal neoplasm that originates from mesoderm-derived notochord and has been reported in humans and animals. Extraskeletal development of a chordoma within the spinal cord is a rare manifestation of this neoplasm. However, based on other reports in dogs, solitary extraskeletal locations of chordomas may be the typical expression of this neoplasm in the dog.

      <str>The endogenous mechanism that determines vertebrate body length is unknown but must involve loss of chordo-neural-hinge (CNH)/axial stem cells and mesoderm progenitors in the tailbud. In early embryos, Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) maintains a cell pool that progressively generates the body and differentiation onset is driven by retinoid repression of FGF signalling. This raises the possibility that FGF maintains key tailbud cell populations and that rising retinoid activity underlies cessation of body axis elongation. Here we show that sudden loss of the mesodermal gene (Brachyury) from CNH and the mesoderm progenitor domain correlates with FGF signalling decline in the late chick tailbud. This is accompanied by expansion of neural gene expression and a similar change in cell fate markers is apparent in the human tailbud. Fate mapping of chick tailbud further revealed that spread of neural gene expression results from continued ingression of CNH-derived cells into the position of the mesoderm progenitor domain. Using gain and loss of function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we then show that attenuation of FGF/Erk signalling mediates this loss of Brachyury upstream of Wnt signalling, while high-level FGF maintains Brachyury and can induce ectopic CNH-like cell foci. We further demonstrate a rise in endogenous retinoid signalling in the tailbud and show that here FGF no longer opposes retinoid synthesis and activity. Furthermore, reduction of retinoid signalling at late stages elevated FGF activity and ectopically maintained mesodermal gene expression, implicating endogenous retinoid signalling in loss of mesoderm identity. Finally, axis termination is concluded by local cell death, which is reduced by blocking retinoid signalling, but involves an FGFR-independent mechanism. We propose that cessation of body elongation involves loss of FGF-dependent mesoderm identity in late stage tailbud and provide evidence that rising endogenous retinoid activity mediates this step and ultimately promotes cell death in chick tailbud.</str>

      <str>Brachyury (T), a member of the T-box gene family, is essential for the formation of posterior mesoderm and notochord in vertebrate development. Expression of the Xenopus homologue of Brachyury, Xbra, causes ectopic ventral and lateral mesoderm formation in animal cap explants and co-expression of Xbra with Pintallavis, a forkhead/HNF3beta-related transcription factor, induces notochord. Although eFGF and the Bix genes are thought to be direct targets of Xbra, no other target genes have been identified. Here, we describe the use of hormone-inducible versions of Xbra and Pintallavis to construct cDNA libraries enriched for targets of these transcription factors. Five putative targets were isolated: Xwnt11, the homeobox gene Bix1, the zinc-finger transcription factor Xegr-1, a putative homologue of the antiproliferative gene BTG1 called Xbtg1, and BIG3/1A11, a gene of unknown function. Expression of Xegr-1 and Xbtg1 is controlled by Pintallavis alone as well as by a combination of Xbra and Pintallavis. Overexpression of Xbtg1 perturbed gastrulation and caused defects in posterior tissues and in notochord and muscle formation, a phenotype reminiscent of that observed with a dominant-negative version of Pintallavis called Pintallavis-En(R). The Brachyury-inducible genes we have isolated shed light on the mechanism of Brachyury function during mesoderm formation. Specification of mesodermal cells is regulated by targets including Bix1-4 and eFGF, while gastrulation movements and perhaps cell division are regulated by Xwnt11 and Xbtg1.</str>

      <str>Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from mouse postimplantation embryos at embryonic day (E) 5.5-E7.5 at the onset of gastrulation, which makes them a valuable tool for studying mammalian postimplantation development in vitro. EpiSCs can also be reprogrammed into a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-like state. Some reports have shown that the reversion of EpiSCs requires transcription factor overexpression, whereas others have suggested that use of stringent mESC culture conditions alone is sufficient for the reversion of EpiSCs. To clarify these discrepancies, we systematically compared a panel of independent EpiSC lines. We found that--regardless of the embryonic day of derivation--the different EpiSC lines shared a number of defining characteristics such as the ability to form teratomas. However, despite use of standard EpiSC culture conditions, some lines exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with mesendodermal differentiation. Pluripotency (Oct4) and mesodermal (Brachyury) marker genes were coexpressed in this subset of lines. Interestingly, the expression of mesendodermal marker genes was negatively correlated with the cells' ability to efficiently undergo neural induction. Moreover, these mesodermal marker gene-expressing cell lines could not be efficiently reverted to an mESC-like state by using stringent mESC culture conditions. Conversely, Brachyury overexpression diminished the reversion efficiency in otherwise Brachyury-negative lines. Overall, our data suggest that different EpiSC lines may undergo self-renewal into distinct developmental states, a finding with important implications for functional readouts such as reversion of EpiSCs to an mESC-like state as well as directed differentiation.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a T-box transcription factor, is expressed in ascidian embryos exclusively in primordial notochord cells and plays a pivotal role in differentiation of notochord cells. Previously, we identified approximately 450 genes downstream of Ciona intestinalis Brachyury (Ci-Bra), and characterized the expression profiles of 45 of these in differentiating notochord cells. In this study, we looked for cisregulatory sequences in minimal enhancers of 20 Ci-Bra downstream genes by electroporating region within approximately 3 kb upstream of each gene fused with lacZ. Eight of the 20 reporters were expressed in notochord cells. The minimal enchancer for each of these eight genes was narrowed to a region approximately 0.5-1.0-kb long. We also explored the genome-wide and coordinate regulation of 43 Ci-Bra-downstream genes. When we determined their chromosomal localization, it became evident that they are not clustered in a given region of the genome, but rather distributed evenly over 13 of the 14 pairs of chromosomes, suggesting that gene clustering does not contribute to coordinate control of the Ci-Bra downstream gene expression. Our results might provide Insights Into the molecular mechanisms underlying notochord formation in chordates.</str>

      <str>Differences in cell responsiveness to an inductive signal contribute to the emergence of a variety of tissue types during animal development. In ascidian embryos, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signal secreted from endoderm cells induces several different tissue types, such as notochord, mesenchyme and brain, at different positions in the embryo at the 32-cell stage. We show here in Halocynthia roretzi that FoxA and Zic are required for notochord formation in cells that receive the FGF signal. We also show that these transcription factors, only when both are supplied, are able to induce ectopic expression of the brachyury gene, a notochord-specific marker, in cells of all the three germ layers in an FGF-dependent manner. These results suggest that FoxA and Zic confer notochord-specific responsiveness to FGF signaling. Further analyses including knockdown and over-expression experiments showed that combinatorial inputs from maternally supplied and zigotically activated factors lead to overlapping expression of FoxA and Zic in the presumptive notochord cells, which eventually activate the expression of the brachyury gene in cooperation with FGF signaling. Our data illustrate how a complex gene network specifies the notochord at its specific position within the embryo.</str>

      <str>The node, or its zebrafish equivalent, Kupffers Vesicle (KV), is thought to generate laterality cues through cilia-dependent signaling. An interaction between Nodal ligands and Nodal antagonists around the node/KV is also required. Here we investigate whether loss of Brachyury/Notail or Tbx16/Spadetail disrupts the balance of Nodal ligands (Southpaw) and antagonists (Charon) around Kupffers Vesicle. Reduction of Spadetail or Notail disrupts expression of southpaw in the perinodal domains flanking Kupffers Vesicle. Similar to what was published for Notail, we find Spadetail is also required for expression of charon. We present evidence for the model that Notail has a direct role in regulating the charon promoter. In particular, a flanking genomic region with putative Notail binding sites can drive KV expression of a reporter in a Notail-dependent fashion. This region also contains motifs for CSL/RBP-J/Su(H). Consistent with this, we find charon expression is strongly Notch-dependent whereas perinodal southpaw expression is not.</str>

      <str>Gastrulation in the amphibian embryo is driven by cells of the mesoderm. One of the genes that confers mesodermal identity in Xenopus is Brachyury (Xbra), which is required for normal gastrulation movements and ultimately for posterior mesoderm and notochord differentiation in the development of all vertebrates. Xbra is a transcription activator, and interference with transcription activation leads to an inhibition of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation. To understand this process, we have screened for downstream target genes of Brachyury (Tada, M., Casey, E., Fairclough, L. and Smith, J. C. (1998) Development 125, 3997-4006). This approach has now allowed us to isolate Xwnt11, whose expression pattern is almost identical to that of Xbra at gastrula and early neurula stages. Activation of Xwnt11 is induced in an immediate-early fashion by Xbra and its expression in vivo is abolished by a dominant-interfering form of Xbra, Xbra-En(R). Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Xwnt11, like overexpression of Xbra-En(R), inhibits convergent extension movements. This inhibition can be rescued by Dsh, a component of the Wnt signalling pathway and also by a truncated form of Dsh which cannot signal through the canonical Wnt pathway involving GSK-3 and (beta)-catenin. Together, our results suggest that the regulation of morphogenetic movements by Xwnt11 occurs through a pathway similar to that involved in planar polarity signalling in Drosophila.</str>

      <str>In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the posterior axis and tail formation in embryogenesis, the function of Neptune, a zinc-finger transcription factor, in Xenopus laevis embryos was investigated. Injection of neptune mRNA into the animal pole area of embryos resulted in the formation of an additional tail structure that included a neural tube and muscle tissue. This activity required FGF signaling since coinjection of a dominant-negative FGF receptor RNA (XFD) completely blocked the formation of a tail structure. A loss-of-function experiment using a fusion construct of neptune and Drosophila engrailed (en-neptune) RNA showed that endogenous Neptune is necessary for formation of the posterior trunk and tail. Furthermore, activity of Neptune was necessary for the endogenous expression of brachyury and fgf-8 at the late gastrula stage. These findings demonstrate a novel function of Neptune in the process of anterior-posterior axis formation through the FGF and brachyury signaling cascades. An experiment using a combination explant with ventral and dorsal marginal tissues showed that cooperation of these two distinct tissues is important for the tail formation and that expression of Neptune in prospective ventral cells may be involved in the activation of the process of tail formation.</str>

      <str>The midline has a theoretical role in the development of left-right asymmetry, and this is supported by both genetic analyses and experimental manipulation of midline structures in vertebrates. The mouse brachyury (T) gene encodes a transcription factor which is expressed in the developing notochord and is required for its development. T/T mice lack a mature notochord and have a dorsalised neural tube. We have examined the hearts of T/T mice and have found consistent morphological abnormalities, resulting in ventrally displaced ventricular loops, and a 50% incidence of inverted heart situs. Three TGF-beta related genes, lefty-1, lefty-2 and nodal, are expressed asymmetrically in mouse embryos, and are implicated in the development of situs. We find that nodal, which is normally expressed around the node and in left lateral plate mesoderm in early somite embryos, is completely absent at this stage in T/T embryos. In contrast, lefty-1 and lefty-2, which are normally expressed in the left half of prospective floorplate and left lateral plate mesoderm, respectively, are both expressed in T/T embryos only in a broad patch of ventral cells in, and just rostral to, the node region. These results implicate the node as a source of instructive signals driving expression of nodal and lefty-2 in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and being required for normal looping and situs of the heart.</str>

It was resected and showed the typical histology of hemangioblastoma, that is, numerous capillaries and stromal cells with focal cytoplasmic vacuolization. Immunohistochemical study revealed that the tumor stromal cells were positive for S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and inhibin-α, supporting the diagnosis. In addition, the tumor cells labeled for carbonic anhydrase IX and brachyury. The diffuse strong carbonic anhydrase IX expression suggested that soft-tissue hemangioblastoma may share with central nervous system hemangioblastoma the tumorigenic mechanism involving the von Hippel-Lindau gene product and hypoxia-inducible factor. The brachyury expression observed in this case, albeit focal and weak, may implicate embryonic hemangioblasts as a potential line of differentiation, as was proposed in central nervous system hemangioblastoma. The patient is well 4 years after the surgery without any recurrence.

      <str>The mouse Brachyury (T) gene is required for differentiation of the notochord and formation of mesoderm during posterior development. Homozygous embryos lacking T activity do not develop a trunk and tail and die in utero. The T gene is specifically expressed in notochord and early mesoderm cells in the embryo. recent data have demonstrated that the T protein is localized in the cell nucleus and specifically binds to a palindrome of 20 bp (the T site) in vitro. We show that the T protein activates expression of a reporter gene in HeLa cells through binding to the T site. Thus T is a novel tissue-specific transcription factor. It consists of a large N-terminal DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-229) and two pairs of transactivation and repression domains in the C-terminal protein half. T can also transactivate transcription through variously oriented and spaced T sites, a fact that may be relevant in the search for genes controlled by T protein and important in mesoderm development.</str>

      <str>Chordates are thought to have emerged from some common ancestor of deuterostomes by organizing shared anatomical and embryological features including a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord and pharyngeal gill slits. Because the notochord is the most prominent feature of chordates and because the Brachyury (T) gene is essential for notochord formation, the T gene is a key molecular probe with which to explore the origin and evolution of chordates. We investigated whether the sea urchin (echinoderm) conserves the T gene and, if so, where the sea urchin T gene is expressed. A cDNA clone for the sea urchin T (HpTa) gene contained a long open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 434 amino acids. Although the overall degree of amino acid identity was not very high (52%, sea urchin/mouse), in the T domain of the N terminus the amino acid identity was 73% (sea urchin/mouse). The HpTa gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome. As with the chordate T gene, the expression of HpTa is transient, being first detected in the swimming blastula, maximally transcribed in the gastrula, decreasing at the prism larval stage and barely detectable at the pluteus larval stage. HpTa transcripts were found in the secondary mesenchyme founder cells, vegetal plate of the mesenchyme blastula, extending tip of the invaginating archenteron and, finally, the secondary mesenchyme cells at the late-gastrula stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</str>

      <str>We have produced null mutant mouse embryonic stem cells for the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Such E-cadherin-/- ES cells are defective in cell aggregation; this defect can be corrected by transfection with cDNA for either E-cadherin or N-cadherin driven by a constitutive promoter. The presence (or absence) of E-cadherin regulates the expression of the transcription factor T-brachyury, indicating that cadherins play a role in linking cell surface receptors and gene expression. Comparative analysis of the parental and the genetically altered ES cell lines was performed to examine cell differentiation and the capability to form organized tissues. While differentiating E-cadherin-/- ES cells are still able to express various early and late differentiation markers, they show a clear-cut deficiency in forming organized structures. This phenotype can be rescued by constitutive expression of E-cadherin, which results exclusively in formation of epithelia. In contrast, rescue transfectants expressing N-cadherin show no epithelial structures, instead forming neuroepithelium and cartilage. These results provide the first evidence that specific cadherins directly stimulate differentiation into certain types of tissues.</str>

      <str>Elucidation of macroevolutionary transitions between diverse animal body plans remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. We address the sponge-eumetazoan transition by analyzing expression of a broad range of eumetazoan developmental regulatory genes in Sycon ciliatum (Calcispongiae). Here we show that many members of surprisingly numerous Wnt and Tgfβ gene families are expressed higher or uniquely in the adult apical end and the larval posterior end. Genes involved in formation of the eumetazoan endomesoderm, such as β-catenin, Brachyury and Gata, as well as germline markers Vasa and Pl10, are expressed during formation and maintenance of choanoderm, the feeding epithelium of sponges. Similarity in developmental gene expression between sponges and eumetazoans, especially cnidarians, is consistent with Haeckel's view that body plans of sponges and cnidarians are homologous. These results provide a framework for further studies aimed at deciphering ancestral developmental regulatory networks and their modifications during animal body plans evolution. </str>

In this study, in order to explore novel molecules that regulate the differentiation of ESCs, we investigated whether collagen hydrolysate, collagen-characteristic amino acids, glycine (Gly), l-proline and trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (l-Hyp); or dipeptides, proline-hydroxyproline and hydroxyproline-glycine regulate the differentiation of mouse embryoid bodies (EBs). We identified that treatment with collagen hydrolysate or Gly repressed the expression of the mesendodermal markers, Brachyury and Foxa2 in EBs and maintained the undifferentiated state of mESCs in a feeder-free monolayer culture. In contrast, l-Hyp promoted the expression of Brachyury, Mixl1, Gsc and Foxa2 in EBs. And the treatment with l-Hyp promoted cardiac differentiation within EBs, which was proven by the spontaneous contraction of cardiomyocytes and the expression of the cardiac markers, α-MHC, MLC-2v and Nkx2.5. Results suggest that l-Hyp is a promising new inducer for reproducible and efficient differentiation of mesendoderm lineages. </str>

      <str>During embryogenesis, left-right sidedness is established by asymmetric expression of laterality genes. A recent model predicts the presence of a functional midline that divides the left side of the embryonic disc from the right side, separating left- and right-inducing signals. We show evidence that this midline is formed from a distinct population of cells within the primitive streak. Cells in the dorsal midline of the chick primitive streak display unique expression of the gastrulation markers fgf-8 and brachyury. These midline cells are fated to die, and dead cells remain in the midline during gastrulation. Inhibition of midline cell death compromises the early expression of laterality genes, such as shh and nodal and randomizes the direction of heart looping. We suggest that cell death along the primitive streak midline is a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of left-right asymmetry during early embryogenesis.</str>

      <str>Currently there is no effective chemotherapy for chordoma. Recent studies report co-expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and its cognate ligand in chordoma, but it is unknown whether this receptor tyrosine kinase is activated in these tumours. Additionally, genetic studies have confirmed frequent deletions of chromosome 9p in chordomas, which encompasses the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) locus. Another gene in this region, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), is an essential enzyme of the purine salvage pathway and has therapeutic relevance because MTAP-deficient cells are particularly sensitive to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis. We investigated whether these pathways might be potential therapeutic targets for chordoma. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 30 chordomas were analysed by immunohistochemistry for expression of the phosphorylated isoforms of IGF1R or the insulin receptor (pIGF1R/pIR) and selected downstream signalling molecules, including BCL2-associated agonist of cell death protein (BAD). Expression of CDKN2A and MTAP proteins was also assessed. Skeletal chondrosarcomas, benign notochordal cell tumours, and fetal notochord were studied for comparison. Phosphorylated IGF1R/IR was detected in 41% of chordomas, together with activated downstream signalling molecules, and pIGF1R/pIR was absent in benign notochordal cell tumours and fetal notochord. Thirty-nine per cent of chordomas were negative for MTAP immunoreactivity. Patients with pIGF1R/pIR-positive tumours showed significantly decreased median disease-free survival in multivariate survival analysis (p = 0.036), whereas phosphorylation of BAD at serine-99 was found to be associated with a favourable prognosis (p = 0.002). Approximately 40% of chordomas demonstrate evidence of activation of the IGF1R/IR signalling pathway or loss of a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. Aberrant signalling cascades and disrupted metabolic pathways such as these may represent opportunities for novel targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Formation of the chordate body is accomplished by a complex set of morphogenetic movements including convergent extension of notochord cells. In the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury plays a key role in the formation of the notochord, and more than 30 Bra-downstream notochord genes have been identified. In the present study, we examined the effects of functional suppression of nine Bra-downstream notochord genes, which include Ci-PTP, Ci-ACL, Ci-prickle, Ci-netrin, Ci-trop, Ci-Noto3, Ci-ASAK, Ci-ERM and Ci-pellino. When the function of the first two genes (Ci-PTP and Ci-ACL) was suppressed with specific morpholinos, the notochord cells failed to converge, while functional suppression of Ci-prickle resulted in a failure of intercalation, and therefore the cells in these three types of embryo remained in the mid-dorsal region of the embryo. Functional suppression of the next four genes (Ci-netrin, Ci-trop, Ci-Noto3 and Ci-ASAK) resulted in the partial defect of intercalation, and the notochord did not consist of a single row. In addition, when the function of the last two genes (Ci-ERM and Ci-pellino) was suppressed, notochord cells failed to elongate in the embryo, even though convergence/extension took place normally. These results indicate that many Bra-downstream notochord genes are involved in convergence/extension of the embryo.</str>

      <str>The notochord has two major roles during chordate embryogenesis, as a source of inductive signals for the patterning of neural tube and paraxial mesoderm and as a supportive organ of the larval tail. Despite the recent identification of mutations that affect the notochord development in vertebrate embryos, little is known about genes that are expressed in the differentiating notochord itself. In the urochordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury (Ci-Bra) plays a key role in notochord differentiation. In a previous study, we isolated cDNA clones for nearly 40 potential Ci-Bra target genes that are expressed in notochord cells (H. Takahashi et al., 1999, Genes Dev. 13, 1519-1523). Here we characterized 20 of them by determining the complete nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs. These genes encode a broad spectrum of divergent proteins associated with notochord formation and function. Two genes encode ascidian homologs of the Drosophila Prickle LIM domain proteins and another encodes the ERM protein, all 3 of which appear to be involved in the control of cytoskeletal architecture. In addition, genes for netrin, leprecan, cdc45, ATP:citrate lyase, ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase, beta4-galactosyltransferase, fibrinogen-like protein, divergent tropomyosin-like proteins, and Drosophila Pellino-like protein were identified. The observation of the netrin gene expression in the notochord may provide the first molecular evidence that the ascidian notochord is a source of signals as in vertebrates. In addition, the present information should be used to identify nonchordate deuterostome tissues homologous to the notochord as well as genes which are expressed in the notochord cells of vertebrate embryos.</str>

      <str>Mouse embryos that are homozygous for the Brachyury (T) deletion die at mid-gestation. They have prominent defects in the notochord, the allantois and the primitive streak. Expression of the T gene commences at the onset of gastrulation and is restricted to the primitive streak, mesoderm emerging from the streak, the head process and the notochord. Genetic evidence has suggested that there may be an increasing demand for T gene function along the rostrocaudal axis. Experiments reported here indicate that this may not be the case. Instead, the gradient in severity of the T defect may be caused by defective mesoderm cell movements, which result in a progressive accumulation of mesoderm cells near the primitive streak. Embryonic stem (ES) cells which are homozygous for the T deletion have been isolated and their differentiation in vitro and in vivo compared with that of heterozygous and wild-type ES cell lines. In +/+&lt;--&gt;T/T ES cell chimeras the Brachyury phenotype is not rescued by the presence of wild-type cells and high level chimeras show most of the features characteristic of intact T/T mutants.

      <str>Vertebrate germ layer development is an intricately interwoven process with the organism operating as an integrated whole. To examine these processes we have used embryonic stem (ES) cell in vitro differentiation in a serum-free, chemically defined medium (CDM). In CDM, ES cells differentiate as embryoid bodies to neuroectoderm with upregulation of pax-6, without commensurate expression of Brachyury. In the presence of Activin A, pax-6 and Brachyury mRNAs are readily detectable, suggestive of both neuroectoderm and mesoderm formation, while in the presence of BMP-4 a process resembling primitive streak formation at the molecular level occurs. Neuroectoderm development in CDM alone is consistent with the view that this process can occur by default, as reported in Xenopus, due to the absence or sequestration of mesoderm-inducing factors. Additionally, these data show that BMP-4 alone is capable of instigating a process resembling primitive streak formation in ES cells and possibly in vivo.</str>

      <str>During limb development, several signaling centers organize limb pattern. One of these, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), is critical for proximodistal limb outgrowth mediated by FGFs. Signals from the underlying mesoderm, including WNTs and FGFs, regulate early steps of AER induction. Ectodermal factors, particularly En1, play a critical role in regulating morphogenesis of a mature, compact AER along the distal limb apex, from a broad ventral ectodermal precursor domain. Contribution of mesodermal factors to the morphogenesis of a mature AER is less clear. We previously noted that the chick T gene (Brachyury), the prototypical T-box transcription factor, is expressed in the limb bud as well as axial mesoderm and primitive streak. Here we show that T is expressed in lateral plate mesoderm at the onset of limb bud formation and subsequently in the subridge mesoderm beneath the AER. Retroviral misexpression of T in chick results in anterior extension of the AER and subsequent limb phenotypes consistent with augmented AER extent and function. Analysis of markers for functional AER in mouse T(-/-) null mutant limb buds reveals disrupted AER morphogenesis. Our data also suggest that FGF and WNT signals may operate both upstream and downstream of T. Taken together, the results show that T plays a role in the regulation of AER formation, particularly maturation, and suggest that T may also be a component of the epithelialmesenchymal regulatory loop involved in maintenance of a mature functioning AER.</str>

      <str>During the molluscan evolution leading to the bivalves, the single dorsal shell was doubled. To elucidate the molecular developmental basis underlying this prominent morphological transition, we described the cell cleavage and expression patterns of three genes, brachyury, engrailed, and dpp in the Japanese spiny oyster Saccostrea kegaki, and examined the function of dpp in this species. The cleavage pattern of the S. kegaki embryo was nearly the same as the previously described pattern of other bivalve species, suggesting that the pattern itself is highly important for the establishment or the maintenance of the bivalve body plan. The expression pattern of a brachyury homolog in S. kegaki (SkBra) was similar to the pattern in gastopods even at the single cell level despite the deep divergence of gastropods and bivalves. Engrailed and dpp were previously found to be expressed around the shell anlagen in gastropods. Like that of gastropods, an engrailed homolog in S. kegaki (SkEn) was found to be expressed around the shell anlagen. However, the dpp homologin S. kegaki (SkDpp) was expressed only in the cells along the dorsal midline. ZfBMP4 treatment experiments revealed the importance of dpp in establishing the characteristic shape of the bivalve shell anlagen.</str>

      <str>Mammalian Argonaute proteins (EIF2C1-4) play an essential role in RNA-induced silencing. Here, we show that the loss of eIF2C2 (Argonaute2 or Ago2) results in gastrulation arrest, ectopic expression of Brachyury (T), and mesoderm expansion. We identify a genetic interaction between Ago2 and T, as Ago2 haploinsufficiency partially rescues the classic T/+ short-tail phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that the ectopic T expression and concomitant mesoderm expansion result from disrupted fibroblast growth factor signaling, likely due to aberrant expression of Eomesodermin. Together, these data indicate that a factor best known as a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex is required for proper fibroblast growth factor signaling during gastrulation, suggesting a possible micro-RNA function in the formation of a mammalian germ layer.</str>

      <str>Gene trapping is a powerful method for identifying novel genes and for analyzing their functions. It is, however, difficult to select trapped genes on the basis of their function. To identify genes regulated by transcription factors that are important in the mesodermal formation, we selected trapped ES clones by infection of adenoviral vectors expressing Pax1, Brachyury, and Foxa2. Among 366 trapped genes, seven seemed to be controlled by these transcription factors in the first screening. The trapped genes were identified by 5' RACE, and a Northern blotting revealed that expressions of three trapped genes were regulated by these transcription factors. Expression patterns of Cx43 and HP1gamma implicated their functional relationships to Foxa2 in the formation of the notochord and the neural tube. Furthermore, Wtap mutant mice derived from the trapped clone showed defects in the mesendoderm formation. Our results indicate that trapped ES clones could be selected effectively using transcription factors.</str>

Here we consider recent studies on the development of the tadpole larva that provide new insights into chordate origins and evolution. The notochord of ascidian larvae and vertebrates appear to be homologous structures based on their induction by endoderm and expression of the Brachyury (T) gene. The muscle cells of ascidian larvae also appear homologous to those of vertebrates based on their expression of bHLH myogenic and muscle-type actin genes, although they are specified by cytoplasmic determinants localized in the egg as well as embryonic induction. Studies of the tailless larvae of anural ascidians have resulted in the identification of Manx, a gene that may control tail development and evolution. These and other results support the ascidian tadpole prototype for the ancestral chordate.</str>

      <str>Gene expression during gastrulation in porcine embryos has been sparsely studied, but there are indications that species-specific patterns exist. Here, we investigated the three-dimensional (3D) expression of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (T) and the forkhead box transcription factor FOXA2 by immunocytochemistry in porcine peri-gastrulation embryos. The first T(+) cells were detected in posterior epiblast of ovoid blastocysts. Later T(+) FOXA2(-) cells were found in the posterior primitive streak (PS) and nascent mesoderm, T(+) FOXA2(+) cells in the anterior PS, probably identifying the organizer region, and T(-) FOXA2(+) cells anterior to this region. In embryos with a neural groove, T and FOXA2 were co-expressed in the node and notochord, FOXA2 was expressed in the floor plate and posteriorly T was expressed in the streak. In all developmental stages, FOXA2 was expressed in the entire hypoblast/definitive endoderm. We conclude that the expression pattern of T and FOXA2 is largely conserved between pig and mouse.</str>

      <str>Although a bone tumor, significant differences in the extent of bone invasion exist in skull base chordoma, which directly affect the extent of surgical resection, and have an impact on its prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon is not clearly understood. Therefore, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics strategy to identify potential molecular signatures, and to find predictive markers of discrepancy in bone invasion of clivus chordoma. According to bone invasive classification criteria, 35 specimens of clivus chordoma were calssified to be either endophytic type (Type I) or exophytic type (Type II). An initial screening of six specimens of endophytic type and six of exophytic was performed, and 250 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Through the GO and IPA analysis, we found evidence that the expression of inflammatory activity-associated proteins up-regulated in endophytic type, whereas the expression of cell motility-associated proteins up-regulated in exophytic ones. Moreover, TGFβ1 and mTOR signal pathway seemed to be related with bone invasion. Thus, TGFβ1, PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and PTEN were validated in the following 23 samples by immune histochemistry and Western blot. The expression levels of TGFβ1 and PTEN were significantly lower in the endophytic type than in the exophytic ones. It was found that TGFβ1 may play an important role in its bone invasion. The mechanisms may be related with conducting an increased inflammatory cell response and a decline in cytoskeletal protein expression. PTEN is confirmed to be associated with the degree of bone invasion. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might be associated with the bone invasion, but still needs a larger sample size to be verified These results, for the first time, not only demonstrate the biological changes that occur in different growth patterns from the perspective of proteomics, but also provide novel markers that may help to reveal the mechanisms behind clivus chordomas. </str>

      <str>Chordoid meningioma (CM) is characterized by a striking histologic resemblance to chordoma and propensity for aggressive behavior or recurrence (WHO grade II designation). Orbital intraosseous CM is extremely uncommon and only one case report has been documented. A case is presented here in which squash smears of a left orbital tumor in a 53-year-old male revealed small clusters or cord-like structures of bland tumor cells embedded in a myxoid or mucinous background. Whorl-like structures were also identified. The tumor cells possessed uniformly round nuclei with a smooth nuclear outline, fine granular chromatin, and small nucleoli. Occasional intranuclear inclusions, coarse collageneous cytoplasmic filaments were observed. Many spindle-shaped cells with similar nuclear findings were also seen. A cytologic diagnosis of a chordoid meningioma was suggested and histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were conducted on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed diffuse and strong membranous and cytoplasmic staining for vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and faintly reactive with S-100 protein but negative for pan-neuroendocrine markers (i.e., NSE, chromogranin A, synaptophysin), cytokeratin AE1/AE3, smooth muscle actin, D2-40, brachyury or class III beta-tubulin. The proliferative index with MIB-1 was less than 1%. The diagnosis of orbital intraosseous CM was confirmed based on cytopathologic, histopathological, immunohistochemical results, location of the tumor, and the lack connection to the duramater. We demonstrated here for the first time the cytopathological features of intraosseous CM with emphasis on differential diagnostic considerations.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation in embryoid bodies (EBs) provides a valuable tool to study the interplay of different germ layers and their influence on cell differentiation. The gene expression of the developing EBs has been shown in many studies, but the protein expression and the spatial composition of different germ layers in human EBs have not been systematically studied. The aim of the present work was to study the temporal and spatial organisation of germ layers based on the expression of mesoderm (Brachyury T), endoderm (AFP) and ectoderm (SOX1) markers during the early stages of differentiation in eight hESC lines. Tissue multi-array technology was applied to study the protein expression of a large number of EBs. According to our results, EB formation and the organisation of germ layers occurred in a similar manner in all the lines. During 12 days of differentiation, all the germ layer markers were present, but no obvious distinct trajectories were formed. However, older EBs were highly organised in structure. Pluripotency marker OCT3/4 expression persisted unexpectedly long in the differentiating EBs. Cavity formation was observed in the immunocytological sections, and caspase-3 expression was high, suggesting a role of apoptosis in hESC differentiation and/or EB formation. The expression of Brachyury T was notably low in all the lines, also those with the best cardiac differentiation capacity, while the expression of SOX1 was higher in some lines, suggesting that the neural differentiation propensity may be detectable already in the early stages of EB differentiation.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiate in vitro into all cell lineages. We previously found that the p38 mitogen activated kinase (p38MAPK) pathway controls the commitment of ES cells toward either cardiomyogenesis (p38 on) or neurogenesis (p38 off ). In this study, we show that p38α knock-out ES cells do not differentiate into cardiac, endothelial, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle lineages. Reexpression of p38MAPK in these cells partially rescues their mesodermal differentiation defects and corrects the high level of spontaneous neurogenesis of knock-out cells. Wild-type ES cells were treated with a p38MAPK-specific inhibitor during the differentiation process. These experiments allowed us to identify 2 early independent successive p38MAPK functions in the formation of mesodermal lineages. Further, the first one correlates with the regulation of the expression of Brachyury, an essential mesodermal-specific transcription factor, by p38MAPK. In conclusion, by genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that p38MAPK activity is essential for the commitment of ES cell into cardiac, endothelial, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle mesodermal lineages.</str>

      <str>The hematopoietic and endothelial lineages derive from mesoderm and are thought to develop through the maturation of a common progenitor, the hemangioblast. To investigate the developmental processes that regulate mesoderm induction and specification to the hemangioblast, we generated an embryonic stem cell line with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) targeted to the mesodermal gene, brachyury. After the in vitro differentiation of these embryonic stem cells to embryoid bodies, developing mesodermal progenitors could be separated from those with neuroectoderm potential based on GFP expression. Co-expression of GFP with the receptor tyrosine kinase Flk1 revealed the emergence of three distinct cell populations, GFP(-)Flk1(-), GFP(+)Flk1(-) and GFP(+)Flk1(+) cells, which represent a developmental progression ranging from pre-mesoderm to prehemangioblast mesoderm to the hemangioblast.</str>

      <str>The heart, brain, and gut develop essential left-right (LR) asymmetries. Specialized groups of ciliated cells have been implicated in LR patterning in mouse, chick, frog, and zebrafish embryos. In zebrafish, these ciliated cells are found in Kupffer's vesicle (KV) and are progeny of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). However, there is no direct evidence in any vertebrate that the genes involved in LR development are specifically required in ciliated cells. By using a novel method in zebrafish, we knocked down the function of no tail (ntl, homologous to mouse brachyury) in DFCs without affecting its expression in other cells in the embryo. We find that the Ntl transcription factor functions cell autonomously in DFCs to regulate KV morphogenesis and LR determination. This is the first evidence that loss-of-gene function exclusively in ciliated cells perturbs vertebrate LR patterning. Our results demonstrate that the ciliated KV, a transient embryonic organ of previously unknown function, is involved in the earliest known step in zebrafish LR development, suggesting that a ciliary-based mechanism establishes the LR axis in all vertebrate embryos.</str>

Red ginseng (RG) is known to have a wide range of pharmacological effects in vivo; however, the reports on its effects on hESCs are few. In this paper, we tried to demonstrate the effects of RG on the proliferation and differentiation of hESCs. Undifferentiated hESCs, embryoid bodies (EBs), and hESC-derived cardiac progenitors (CPs) were treated with RG extract at 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/mL. After treatment of undifferentiated hESCs from day 2 to day 6 of culture, BrdU labeling showed that RG treatment increased the proliferation of hESCs, and the expression of Oct4 and Nanog was increased in RG-treated group. To find out the effects of RG on early differentiation stage cells, EBs were treated with RG extract for 10 days and attached for further differentiation. Immunostaining for three germ layer markers showed that RG treatment increased the expressions of Brachyury and HNF3β on EBs. Also, RG treatment increased the expression of Brachyury in early-stage and of Nkx2.5 in late-stage hESC-derived CPs.

      <str>The primitive streak is where the mesoderm and definitive endoderm precursor cells ingress from the epiblast during gastrulation. It is often described as an embryological feature common to all amniotes. But such a feature has not been associated with gastrulation in any reptilian species. A parsimonious model would be that the primitive streak evolved independently in the avian and mammalian lineages. Looking beyond the primitive streak, can one find shared features of mesoderm and endoderm formation during amniote gastrulation? Here, we survey the literature on reptilian gastrulation and provide new data on Brachyury RNA and laminin protein expression in gastrula-stage turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) embryos. We propose a model to reconcile the primitive streak-associated gastrulation in birds and the blastopore-associated gastrulation in extant reptiles.</str>

      <str>RNA helicase A (RHA) is the human homologue of the Drosophila maleless protein, an essential factor for the development of male flies. Recently, it was shown that RHA cooperates with the cAMP-responsive element in mediating the cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation of a number of genes. Due to the participation of cAMP as a second messenger in a number of signaling pathways, we examined the function of RHA during mammalian embryogenesis. To examine the role(s) of RHA in mammalian development, RHA knockout mice were generated by homologous recombination. Homozygosity for the mutant RHA allele led to early embryonic lethality. Histological analysis, combined with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL) reactions of RHA-null embryos, revealed marked apoptotic cell death specifically in embryonic ectodermal cells during gastrulation. RNA in situ analyses of the expression of HNF-3beta and Brachyury, two molecular markers for gastrulation, showed that RHA-null embryos at days 7.5 and 8.5 expressed both HNF-3beta and Brachyury in a pattern similar to those of pre- and early streak stages of embryos, respectively. These observations indicate that RHA is necessary for early embryonic development and suggest the requirement of RHA for the survival and differentiation of embryonic ectoderm.</str>

      <str>Early detection of lung cancer is challenging due to a lack of adequate biomarkers. To discover novel tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) silenced by aberrant promoter methylation, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines using pharmacologic-unmasking and subsequent microarray-analysis. Among 617 genes upregulated, we selected 30 genes and investigated the methylation status of their promoters by bisulfite sequencing analysis. Aberrant methylation was detected in four genes (CRABP2, NOEY2, T, MAP2K3) in at least one lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, the T promoter was methylated in 60% of primary lung adenocarcinomas versus 13% of non-malignant lung tissues. Conversely, RT-PCR analysis revealed T expression was low in lung tumors, while high in normal tissues. In addition, no non-synonymous mutations related to gene silencing were found. While further analysis is warranted, our results suggest that T has the potential to be a novel candidate TSG in lung cancer.</str>

      <str>The Brachyury genes of two divergent ascidians, As-T of Halocynthia roretzi and Ci-Bra of Ciona intestinalis, are expressed exclusively in notochord precursor cells. A previous study showed that the notochord-specific expression of Ci-Bra is controlled by a minimal promoter that is composed of three distinct regions: a region responsible for repression of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, a region for activation of expression in notochord cells, and a region for activation of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, distal to proximal to the transcription initiation site, respectively. We examined various deletion constructs of the As-T/lacZ fusion gene and demonstrate that a module between -289 and -250 bp of the 5'-flanking region is responsible for notochord-specific expression of the reporter gene. Gel-shift assays suggested the binding of nuclear protein(s) to this module. The 5'-flanking region of As-T contains a potential T-binding motif (-ACCTAGGT-) around -160 bp. Deletion of this motif from the p(-289)As-T/lacZ diminished the reporter gene expression. In addition, coinjection of p(-289)As-T/lacZ and synthetic As-T mRNA resulted in ectopic expression of lacZ in non-notochord cells, suggesting that the T-binding motif is responsible for autoactivation of the gene. These findings revealed striking differences between the minimal promoters of As-T and Ci-Bra so far revealed, with respect to their notochord-specific expression. Furthermore, reciprocal injections of reporter gene constructs, namely As-T/lacZ into Ciona eggs and Ci-Bra/lacZ into Halocynthia eggs, suggest alterations in the cis-regulatory elements and trans-activation factors that have occurred during evolution of the two ascidian species.</str>

      <str>The tumour microenvironment is complex and composed of many different constituents, including matricellular proteins such as connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), and is characterized by gradients in oxygen levels. In various cancers, hypoxia and CCN2 promote stem and progenitor cell properties, and regulate the proliferation, migration and phenotype of cancer cells. Our study was aimed at investigating the effects of hypoxia and CCN2 on chordoma cells, using the human U-CH1 cell line. We demonstrate that under basal conditions, U-CH1 cells express multiple CCN family members including CCN1, CCN2, CCN3 and CCN5. Culture of U-CH1 cells in either hypoxia or in the presence of recombinant CCN2 peptide promoted progenitor cell-like characteristics specific to the notochordal tissue of origin. Specifically, hypoxia induced the most robust increase in progenitor-like characteristics in U-CH1 cells, including increased expression of the notochord-associated markers T, CD24, FOXA1, ACAN and CA12, increased cell growth and tumour-sphere formation, and a decrease in the percentage of vacuolated cells present in the heterogeneous population. Interestingly, the effects of recombinant CCN2 peptide on U-CH1 cells were more pronounced under normoxia than hypoxia, promoting increased expression of CCN1, CCN2, CCN3 and CCN5, the notochord-associated markers SOX5, SOX6, T, CD24, and FOXA1 as well as increased tumour-sphere formation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of multiple factors within the tumour microenvironment and how hypoxia and CCN2 may regulate human chordoma cell behaviour. </str>

      <str>Chordomas are an aggressive rare type of malignant bone tumors arising from the remnant of the notochord. Chordomas occur mainly in vertebral bones and account for 1-4% of malignant bone tumors. Management and treatment of chordomas are difficult as they are resistant to conventional chemotherapy; therefore, they are mainly treated with surgery and radiation therapy. In this study, we performed DNA methylation profiling of 26 chordomas and normal nucleus pulposus samples plus UCH-1 chordoma cell line using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite sequencing was used to confirm the methylation data. Gene expression was analyzed using RT-PCR before and after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaDC) treatment of chordoma cell lines. Analysis of the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data led to the identification of 8,819 loci (2.9%) that were significantly differentially methylated (&gt;0.2 average β-value difference) between chordomas and nucleus pulposus samples (adjusted P &lt; 0.05). Among these, 5,868 probes (66.5%) were hypomethylated, compared to 2,951 (33.5%) loci that were hypermethylated in chordomas compared to controls. From the 2,951 differentially hypermethylated probes, 33.3% were localized in the promoter region (982 probes) and, among these, 104 probes showed cancer-specific hypermethylation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicates that the cancer-specific differentially methylated loci are involved in various networks including cancer disease, nervous system development and function, cell death and survival, cellular growth, cellular development, and proliferation. Furthermore, we identified a subset of probes that were differentially methylated between recurrent and non-recurrent chordomas. BeadChip methylation data was confirmed for these genes and gene expression was shown to be upregulated in methylated chordoma cell lines after treatment with 5-azaDC. Understanding epigenetic changes in chordomas may provide insights into chordoma tumorigenesis and development of epigenetic biomarkers. </str>

Despite the lack of posterior mesoderm in spt(-);ntl(-) embryos, dorsal-ventral neural tube patterning is relatively normal, with the notable exception that posterior medial floor plate is completely absent. This contrasts sharply with observations in single mutants, as mutations singly in ntl or spt enhance posterior medial floor plate development. We find that ntl function is required to repress medial floor plate and promote notochord fate in cells of the wild-type notochord domain and that spt and ntl together are required non cell-autonomously for medial floor plate formation, suggesting that an inducing signal present in wild-type mesoderm is lacking in spt(-);ntl(-) embryos.</str>

      <str>Germ cells ensure reproduction and heredity. In mice, primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors for spermatozoa and oocytes, are induced in pluripotent epiblast by BMP4 and WNT3, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, using an in vitro PGC specification system, we show that WNT3 induces many transcription factors associated with mesoderm in epiblast-like cells through β-CATENIN. Among these, T (BRACHYURY), a classical and conserved mesodermal factor, was essential for robust activation of Blimp1 and Prdm14, two of the germline determinants. T, but not SMAD1 or TCF1, binds distinct regulatory elements of both Blimp1 and Prdm14 and directly upregulates these genes, delineating the downstream PGC program. Without BMP4, a program induced by WNT3 prevents T from activating Blimp1 and Prdm14, demonstrating a permissive role of BMP4 in PGC specification. These findings establish the key signaling mechanism for, and a fundamental role of a mesodermal factor in, mammalian PGC specification.</str>

      <str>The modulation of developmental biochemical pathways by mechanical cues is an emerging feature of animal development, but its evolutionary origins have not been explored. Here we show that a common mechanosensitive pathway involving β-catenin specifies early mesodermal identity at gastrulation in zebrafish and Drosophila. Mechanical strains developed by zebrafish epiboly and Drosophila mesoderm invagination trigger the phosphorylation of β-catenin-tyrosine-667. This leads to the release of β-catenin into the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it triggers and maintains, respectively, the expression of zebrafish brachyury orthologue notail and of Drosophila Twist, both crucial transcription factors for early mesoderm identity. The role of the β-catenin mechanosensitive pathway in mesoderm identity has been conserved over the large evolutionary distance separating zebrafish and Drosophila. This suggests mesoderm mechanical induction dating back to at least the last bilaterian common ancestor more than 570 million years ago, the period during which mesoderm is thought to have emerged. </str>

Despite its wide use and importance in stem cell and developmental biology, its functional genomic targets in human cells are largely unknown. Here, we use differentiating human embryonic stem cells to study the role of BRA in activin A-induced endoderm and BMP4-induced mesoderm progenitors. We show that BRA has distinct genome-wide binding landscapes in these two cell populations, and that BRA interacts and collaborates with SMAD1 or SMAD2/3 signalling to regulate the expression of its target genes in a cell-specific manner. Importantly, by manipulating the levels of BRA in cells exposed to different signalling environments, we demonstrate that BRA is essential for mesoderm but not for endoderm formation. Together, our data illuminate the function of BRA in the context of human embryonic development and show that the regulatory role of BRA is context dependent. Our study reinforces the importance of analysing the functions of a transcription factor in different cellular and signalling environments. </str>

      <str>We previously described a locus on chromosome (Chr) 17 of the mouse that is critical for normal testis development. This locus was designated "T-associated sex reversal" (Tas) because it segregated with the dominant brachyury allele hairpin tail (Thp) and caused gonads of C57BL/6J XY, Thp/+ individuals to develop as ovaries or ovotestes rather than as testes. To clarify the inheritance of Tas, we investigated the effects of T-Orleans (TOrl), another brachyury mutation, on gonad development. We found that gonads of C57BL/6J XY, Thp/+ and TOrl/+ mice develop ovarian tissue if the Y chromosome is derived from the AKR/J inbred strain, whereas normal testicular development occurs in the presence of a Y chromosome derived from the C57BL/6J inbred strain. From these observations we conclude that: (1) Tas is located in a region on Chr 17 common to the deletions associated with Thp, and TOrl, and (2) the Y-linked testis determining gene, Tdy, carried by the AKR/J inbred strain differs from that of the C57BL/6J inbred strain. We suggest that in mammals Tdy is not the sole testis determinant because autosomal loci must be genetically compatible with Tdy for normal testicular development.</str>

      <str>We analysed the role of Notch signalling during the specification of the dorsal midline in Xenopus embryos. By activating or blocking the pathway we found that Notch expands the floor plate domain of sonic hedgehog and pintallavis and represses the notochordal markers chordin and brachyury, with a concomitant reduction of the notochord size. We propose that within a population of the early organiser with equivalent potential to develop either as notochord or floor plate, Notch activation favours floor plate development at the expense of the notochord, preferentially before mid gastrula. We present evidence that sonic hedgehog down-regulates chordin, suggesting that secreted Sonic hedgehog may be involved or reinforcing the cell-fate switch executed by Notch. We also show that Notch signalling requires Presenilin to modulate this switch.</str>

      <str>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for patterning many structures in vertebrates including the nervous system, chordamesoderm, limb and endodermal organs. In the sea urchin, a basal deuterostome, Hh signaling is shown to participate in organizing the mesoderm. At gastrulation the Hh ligand is expressed by the endoderm downstream of the Brachyury and FoxA transcription factors in the endomesoderm gene regulatory network. The co-receptors Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo) are expressed by the neighboring skeletogenic and non-skeletogenic mesoderm. Perturbations of Hh, Ptc and Smo cause embryos to develop with skeletal defects and inappropriate non-skeletogenic mesoderm patterning, although initial specification of mesoderm occurs without detectable abnormalities. Perturbations of the pathway caused late defects in skeletogenesis and in the non-skeletogenic mesoderm, including altered numbers of pigment and blastocoelar cells, randomized left-right asymmetry of coelomic pouches, and disorganized circumesophageal muscle causing an inability to swallow. Together the data support the requirement of Hh signaling in patterning each of the mesoderm subtypes in the sea urchin embryo.</str>

      <str>Developmental genetics has shown that the Brachyury (T) gene has a key role in mesoderm formation during gastrulation in the mouse. Homozygous embryos have a defective allantois, degenerate or absent notochord and disrupted primitive streak and node. The neural tube is kinked and somite formation interrupted. The T gene has been cloned and is expressed during the early stages of gastrulation, being restricted to the primitive streak region, nascent mesoderm and notochord. Neither the sequence of the gene nor its expression pattern define its developmental function. To study the cell autonomy of the T mutation we have isolated and genetically characterized embryonic stem cell lines and studied their behaviour in chimaeras. T/+ embryonic stem cells form normal chimaeras, whereas T/T in equilibrium with +/+ chimaeras mimic the T/T mutant phenotype. The results indicate that the T gene acts cell autonomously in the primitive streak and notochord but may activate a signalling pathway involved in the specification of other mesodermal tissues.</str>

      <str>Members of the T box family of transcription factors play important roles in early development. Different members of the family exert different effects and here we show that much of the specificity of the Xenopus T box proteins Xbra, VegT and Eomesodermin resides in the DNA-binding domain, or T box. Binding site selection experiments show that the three proteins bind the same core sequence, but they select paired sites that differ in their orientation and spacing. Lysine 149 of Xbra is conserved in all Brachyury homologues, while the corresponding amino acid in VegT and Eomesodermin is asparagine. Mutation of this amino acid to lysine changes the inductive abilities of VegT and Eomesodermin to resemble that of Xbra.</str>

      <str>Blastopore formation, the embryonic disk, archenteron and notochord elongation, and Brachyury expression in the marsupial frog Gastrotheca riobambae was compared with embryos of Xenopus laevis and of the dendrobatids Colostethus machalilla and Epipedobates anthonyi. In contrast with X. laevis embryos, the blastopore closes before elongation of the archenteron and notochord in the embryos of G. riobambae and of the dendrobatid frogs. Moreover, the circumblastoporal collar (CBC) thickens due to the accumulation of involuted cells. An embryonic disk, however, is formed only in the G. riobambae gastrula. We differentiate three gastrulation patterns according to the speed of development: In X. laevis, elongation of the archenteron and notochord begin in the early to mid gastrula, whereas in the dendrobatids C. machalilla and E. anthonyi the archenteron elongates at mid gastrula and the notochord elongates after gastrulation. In G. riobambae, only involution takes place during gastrulation. Archenteron and notochord elongation occur in the post gastrula. In the non-aquatic reproducing frogs, the margin of the archenteron expands anisotropically, resulting in an apparent displacement of the CBC from a medial to a posterior location, resembling the displacement of Hensen's node in the chick and mouse. The differences detected indicate that amphibian gastrulation is modular.</str>

      <str>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multipotent cytokine that is mediated by its receptor, c-MET. HGF/c-MET contributes to tumor progression in many human malignancies; however, HGF/c-MET is inversely correlated with aggressive biologic behavior in other cancers. Conversely, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the significance of HGF/c-MET expression in skull base chordoma.</str>
      <str>Using immunohistochemical techniques, the authors investigated HGF/c-MET expression in 46 primary and 25 recurrent lesions, and compared it with the expression of proteinases and cell differentiation markers, proliferative ability, and other clinicopathologic parameters.</str>
      <str>c-MET was found to be expressed in 70.0% of primary and 88.0% of recurrent lesions. HGF expression was scarcely detected. Higher c-MET expression was found to be correlated with younger patient age. Lesions with a higher expression of low molecular weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2) demonstrated significantly higher c-MET scores in both primary and recurrent lesions compared with those with lower CAM5.2 expression. In recurrent lesions, higher c-MET expression was found to be associated with the scores of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA); however, only uPA was found to be correlated with higher c-MET expression in primary lesions. c-MET expression did not appear to be correlated with MIB-1 labeling index. Patients with higher c-MET expression were found to have longer survival.</str>

      <str>The transcription factor brachyury is a major driver of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human carcinoma cells. It is overexpressed in several human tumor types versus normal adult tissues, except for testes and thyroid. Overexpression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. Previous studies identified a brachyury HLA-A2 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope. The studies reported here describe an enhancer epitope of brachyury. Compared to the native epitope, the agonist epitope: (a) has enhanced binding to MHC class I, (b) increased the IFN-γ production from brachyury-specific T cells, (c) generated brachyury-specific T cells with greater levels of perforin and increased proliferation, (d) generated T cells more proficient at lysing human carcinoma cells endogenously expressing the native epitope, and (e) achieved greater brachyury-specific T-cell responses in vivo in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. These studies also report the generation of a heat-killed recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) vector expressing the full-length brachyury gene encoding the agonist epitope. Compared to yeast-brachyury (native) devoid of the agonist epitope, the yeast-brachyury (agonist) enhanced the activation of brachyury-specific T cells, which efficiently lysed human carcinoma cells. In addition to providing the rationale for the recombinant yeast-brachyury (agonist) as a potential vaccine in cancer therapy, these studies also provide the rationale for the use of the agonist in (a) dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, (b) adjuvant or liposomal vaccines, (c) recombinant viral and/or bacterial vaccines, (d) protein/polypeptide vaccines, (e) activation of T cells ex vivo in adoptive therapy protocols, and (f) generation of genetically engineered targeted T cells. </str>

      <str>The Nkx2-5 homeodomain protein plays a key role in cardiomyogenesis. Ectopic expression in frog and zebrafish embryos results in an enlarged myocardium; however, expression of Nkx2-5 in fibroblasts was not able to trigger the development of beating cardiac muscle. In order to examine the ability of Nkx2-5 to modulate endogenous cardiac specific gene expression in cells undergoing early stages of differentiation, P19 cell lines overexpressing Nkx2-5 were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO. Nkx2-5 expression induced cardiomyogenesis in these cultures aggregated without Me2SO. During differentiation into cardiac muscle, Nkx2-5 expression resulted in the activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), but not MEF2A, -B, or -D. In order to compare the abilities of Nkx2-5 and MEF2C to induce cellular differentiation, P19 cells overexpressing MEF2C were aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Similar to Nkx2-5, MEF2C expression initiated cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. These findings indicate the presence of a positive regulatory network between Nkx2-5 and MEF2C and show that both factors can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is aggressive, locally invasive, and has a poor prognosis. Chordomas are thought to arise from transformed remnants of notochord and have a predilection for the axial skeleton, with the most common sites being the sacrum, skull base, and spine. The gold standard treatment for chordomas of the mobile spine and sacrum is en-bloc excision with wide margins and postoperative external-beam radiation therapy. Treatment of clival chordomas is unique from other locations with an enhanced emphasis on preservation of neurological function, typified by a general paradigm of maximally safe cytoreductive surgery and advanced radiation delivery techniques. In this Review, we highlight current standards in diagnosis, clinical management, and molecular characterisation of chordomas, and discuss current research.</str>

We investigated the occurrence and distribution of galectin-3 in the embryonic and fetal human notochord, the developing human vertebral column, adult intervertebral discs and in six chordomas, which are tumors thought to originate from notochordal remnants. By means of Western blots, the expression of galectin-3 was confirmed in tissue probes from the vertebral column region beginning with the 8th gestational week. These results were supported by immunohistochemical data which revealed the presence of galectin-3 in the cytoplasm of cells of the notochord also from the 8th gestational week onwards. Notochordal immunostaining became stronger with increasing gestational age. A persisting notochordal remnant in an adult intervertebral disc and various cells of the nucleus pulposus also contained galectin-3. All chordomas showed moderate or strong immunoreactivity irrespective of their cellular composition. Subcellularly, galectin-3 was localized mostly in the cytoplasm, while a subset of tumor cells also showed nuclear distribution. Differences in staining patterns of chordoma cells could not, in general, be correlated to any histological features of these tumors.</str>

      <str>Dynamic spatiotemporal expression of the nodal gene and its orthologs is involved in the dose-dependent induction and patterning of mesendoderm during early vertebrate embryogenesis. We report loss-of-function studies that define a high degree of synergistic negative regulation on the Xenopus nodal-related genes (Xnrs) by extracellular Xenopus antivin/lefty (Xatv/Xlefty)-mediated functional antagonism and Brachyury-mediated transcriptional suppression. A strong knockdown of Xlefty/Xatv function was achieved by mixing translation- and splicing-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides that target both the A and B alloalleles of Xatv. Secreted and cell-autonomous inhibitors of Xnr signaling were used to provide evidence that Xnr-mediated induction was inherently long-range in this situation in the large amphibian embryo, essentially being capable of spreading over the entire animal hemisphere. There was a greater expansion of the Organizer and mesendoderm tissues associated with dorsal specification than noted in previous Xatv knockdown experiments in Xenopus, with consequent exogastrulation and long-term maintenance of expanded axial tissues. Xatv deficiency caused a modest animal-ward expansion of the marginal zone expression territory of the Xnr1 and Xnr2 genes. In contrast, introducing inhibitory Xbra-En(R) fusion constructs into Xatv-deficient embryos caused a much larger increase in the level and spatial extent of Xnr expression. However, in both cases (Xatv/Xlefty-deficiency alone, or combined with Xbra interference), Xnr2 expression was constrained to the superficial cell layer, suggesting a fundamental tissue-specific competence in the ability to express Xnrs, an observation with direct implications regarding the induction of endodermal vs. mesodermal fates. Our experiments reveal a two-level suppressive mechanism for restricting the level, range, and duration of Xnr signaling via extracellular inhibition by Xatv/Xlefty coupled with potent indirect transcriptional repression by Xbra.</str>

      <str>The tadpole larva of an ascidian develops 40 notochord cells in the center of its tail. Most of the notochord cells originate from the A-line precursors, among which inductive interactions are required for the subsequent differentiation of notochord. The presumptive-endoderm blastomeres or presumptive-notochord blastomeres themselves are inducers of notochord formation. Notochord induction takes place during the 32-cell stage. In amphibia, mesoderm induction is thought to be mediated by several growth factors, for example, activins and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). In the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, treatment with bFGF of presumptive-notochord blastomeres that had been isolated at the early 32-cell stage promoted the formation of notochord at a low concentration of bFGF (0.02 ng/ml), while activin failed to induce notochord differentiation. The effect of bFGF reached a maximum at the end of the 32-cell stage and rapidly faded at the beginning of the subsequent cleavage, the time for full induction of notochord being at least 20 minutes. The expression of As-T, a previously isolated ascidian homolog of the mouse Brachyury (T) gene, starts at the 64-cell stage and is detectable exclusively in the presumptive-notochord blastomeres. The present study showed that presumptive-notochord blastomeres, isolated at the early 32-cell stage, neither differentiated into notochord nor expressed the As-T gene. However, when the presumptive-notochord blastomeres were coisolated or recombined with inducer blastomeres, transcripts of As-T were detected. When presumptive-notochord blastomeres were treated with bFGF, the expression of the As-T gene was also detected. These results suggest that inductive interaction is required for the expression of the As-T gene and that the expression of the As-T gene is closely correlated with the determined state of the notochord-precursor cells.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are radio- and chemo-resistant tumours and metastasise in as many as 40% of patients. The aim of this study was to identify potential molecular targets for the treatment of chordoma. In view of the reported association of chordoma and tuberous sclerosis complex syndrome, and the available therapeutic agents against molecules in the PI3K/AKT/TSC1/TSC2/mTOR pathway, a tissue microarray of 50 chordoma cases was analysed for expression of active molecules involved in this signalling pathway by immunohistochemistry and a selected number by western blot analysis. Chordomas were positive for p-AKT (92%), p-TSC2 (96%), p-mTOR (27%), total mTOR (75%), p-p70S6K (62%), p-RPS6 (22%), p-4E-BP1 (96%) and eIF-4E (98%). Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 expression was lost in 16% of cases. Mutations failed to be identified in PI3KCA and RHEB1 in the 23 cases for which genomic DNA was available. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis for mTOR and RPS6 loci showed that 11 of 33 and 21 of 44 tumours had loss of one copy of the respective genes, results which correlated with the loss of the relevant total proteins. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis for loci containing TSC1 and TSC2 revealed that all cases analysed harboured two copies of the respective genes. On the basis of p-mTOR and or p-p70S6K expression there is evidence indicating that 65% of the chordomas studied may be responsive to mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin or its analogues, and that patients may benefit from combined therapy including drugs that inhibit AKT.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are locally invasive tumors that have a tendency to relapse despite optimal treatment. Specific biological markers might be used to describe their behavior. There is currently no agreement regarding the best way to manage intracranial chordomas. We studied the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and Ki-M1P in 145 paraffin-embedded tumors. The purpose of our study was to determine: (a) the role of potent angiogenic factors VEGFR-2 and iNOS and their relationship to each other in skull base chordoma and (b) the role of monocytes/macrophages as a potential iNOS source in the angiogenic process. A series of 74 chordoma patients for a total of 145 lesions (including 71 recurrent lesions) and 10 specimens from embryonic notochord were investigated for the expression of iNOS, VEGFR-2, Ki-M1P, and CD-34 using immunohistochemistry. In the majority of the chordomas, correlations were found between iNOS and the immunoreactivity of Ki-M1P (r = 0.5303, P &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, the expressions of Ki-M1P was correlated with VEGFR-2 (r = 0.4181, P &lt; 0.0001). Our results indicate that chordomas may respond to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as VEGFR-2 or modulators of other downstream signaling molecules. The future of VEGFR-2 and iNOS inhibitors as therapeutic agents in the treatment of chordoma will be clearer over the next years as results of the current clinical trials become available and as the factors regulating angiogenesis and the interactions between these factors are elucidated. However, appropriate functional experiments remain to be conducted to prove such a hypothesis. </str>

      <str>A cDNA clone for a starfish T-box gene (Ap-Tbr) was isolated and characterized. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the Ap-Tbr gene was a member of the T-brain subfamily, which includes mouse T-brain-1 and Xenopus Eomesodermin. Ap-Tbr was expressed as early as in late blastulae, and the transcript was evident in a disc-like region at the vegetal end or the vegetal plate. In early gastrulae, the gene was expressed in the cells of the invaginated archenteron, from which the majority of mesodermal cells as well as some endodermal cells are derived. The Ap-Tbr expression disappeared by the end of gastrulation, and was not detected in early bipinnaria larvae. This expression pattern of Ap-Tbr suggests its role in an early step of archenteron invagination, associated with mesoderm and endoderm formation. Furthermore, double staining of late blastulae and early gastrulae with a probe specific for Ap-Tbr and one for ApBra (the starfish Brachyury gene) demonstrated that the regions of Ap-Tbr and ApBra expression at the vegetal/posterior end of the embryo did not overlap, the region with Ap-Tbr expression being encircled by a ring-shaped region of ApBra expression. A gap without expression of the two genes was located between them, and the gap was seen around the blastoporal lip in the early gastrula. These observations suggest implication of the two T-box genes, with different roles, in starfish gastrulation.</str>

      <str>A detailed morphological staging system for cattle embryos at stages following blastocyst hatching and preceding gastrulation is presented here together with spatiotemporal mapping of gene expression for BMP4, BRACHYURY, CERBERUS1 (CER1), CRIPTO, EOMESODERMIN, FURIN and NODAL. Five stages are defined based on distinct developmental events. The first of these is the differentiation of the visceral hypoblast underlying the epiblast, from the parietal hypoblast underlying the mural trophoblast. The second concerns the formation of an asymmetrically positioned, morphologically recognisable region within the visceral hypoblast that is marked by the presence of CER1 and absence of BMP4 expression. We have termed this the anterior visceral hypoblast or AVH. Intra-epiblast cavity formation and the disappearance of the polar trophoblast overlying the epiblast (Rauber's layer) have been mapped in relation to AVH formation. The third chronological event involves the transition of the epiblast into the embryonic ectoderm with concomitant onset of posterior NODAL, EOMES and BRACHYURY expression. Lastly, gastrulation commences as the posterior medial embryonic ectoderm layer thickens to form the primitive streak and cells ingress between the embryonic ectoderm and hypoblast. At this stage a novel domain of CER1 expression is seen whereas the AVH disappears. Comparison with the mouse reveals that while gene expression patterns at the onset of gastrulation are well conserved, asymmetry establishment, which relies on extraembryonic tissues such as the hypoblast and trophoblast, has diverged in terms of both gene expression and morphology. </str>

      <str>Dietary deprivation and gene disruption studies clearly demonstrate that biologically active retinoids, such as retinoic acid (RA), are essential for numerous developmental programs. Similar ontogenic processes are also affected by retinoic acid excess, suggesting that the effects of retinoid administration reflect normal retinoid-dependent events. In the mouse, exogenous retinoic acid can induce both anterior (anencephaly, exencephaly) and posterior (spina bifida) neural tube defects depending on the developmental stage of treatment. Retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) mediates these effects on the caudal neural tube at 8.5 days postcoitum, as RARgamma-/- mice are completely resistant to spina bifida induced by retinoic acid at this stage. We therefore used this null mouse as a model to examine the molecular nature of retinoid-induced caudal neural tube defects by using a panel of informative markers and comparing their expression between retinoic acid-treated wild-type and RARgamma-/- embryos. Our findings indicate that treatment of wild-type embryos led to a rapid and significant decrease in the caudal expression of all mesodermal markers examined (e.g., brachyury, wnt-3a, cdx-4), whereas somite, neuroepithelial, notochord, floorplate, and hindgut markers were unaffected. RARgamma-/- mutants exhibited normal expression patterns for all markers examined, consistent with the notion that mesodermal defects underlie the etiology of retinoid-induced spina bifida. We also found that posterior somitic, but not caudal presomitic, embryonic tissues contained detectable bioactive retinoids, an observation which correlated with the ability of caudal explants to rapidly clear exogenous RA. Interestingly, transcripts encoding mP450RAI, a cytochrome P450, the product of which is believed to catabolize retinoic acid, were abundant in the retinoid-poor region of the caudal embryo. mP450RAI was rapidly induced by retinoic acid treatment in vivo, consistent with previous studies suggesting that it plays a critical role in retinoid signaling. These data suggest that nascent mesoderm is highly sensitive to retinoic acid and that mP450RAI serves to tightly regulate retinoid levels in the caudal embryo. These findings also raise the possibility that RA may play a role in the generation of posterior mesoderm derivatives in part by affecting brachyury expression.</str>

      <str>The first haematopoietic stem cells in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates are derived from mesoderm, therefore genes that are important in mesoderm patterning and formation might also play an essential role in haematopoietic stem cell commitment and differentiation. Several members of the Wnt gene family are expressed in very specific patterns in embryonic mesoderm and have previously been shown to act as haematopoietic growth factors. In order to investigate in detail the role that such secreted proteins play in the biology of early haematopoietic commitment we have used in vitro differentiation of murine embryonal stem (ES) as a model system. Using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis we identified several candidate Wnt genes whose expression pattern was consistent with a role in generation, maintenance and/or differentiation of early haematopoietic progenitor cells including three genes previously shown to have a role in haematopoiesis (Wnt5a, Wnt2b and Wnt10b). The most interesting candidate was Wnt3, because of its strong and regulated expression during in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells as well as its early embryonic expression in mesoderm. Overexpression of Wnt3 was sufficient to cause a consistent increase in the number of embryoid bodies committing to haematopoiesis further strengthening the evidence that this protein can enhance haematopoietic commitment during in vitro differentiation of ES cells. In addition, overexpression of Wnt3 caused a marked upregulation of Brachyury expression, thus providing some evidence that Brachyury may be one of the target genes for the Wnt3 signalling pathway.</str>

      <str>Bcor (BCL6 corepressor) is a widely expressed gene that is mutated in patients with X-linked Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome. BCOR regulates gene expression in association with a complex of proteins capable of epigenetic modification of chromatin. These include Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase components and a Jumonji C (Jmjc) domain containing histone demethylase. To model OFCD in mice and dissect the role of Bcor in development we have characterized two loss of function Bcor alleles. We find that Bcor loss of function results in a strong parent-of-origin effect, most likely indicating a requirement for Bcor in extraembryonic development. Using Bcor loss of function embryonic stem (ES) cells and in vitro differentiation assays, we demonstrate that Bcor plays a role in the regulation of gene expression very early in the differentiation of ES cells into ectoderm, mesoderm and downstream hematopoietic lineages. Normal expression of affected genes (Oct3/4, Nanog, Fgf5, Bmp4, Brachyury and Flk1) is restored upon re-expression of Bcor. Consistent with these ES cell results, chimeric animals generated with the same loss of function Bcor alleles show a low contribution to B and T cells and erythrocytes and have kinked and shortened tails, consistent with reduced Brachyury expression. Together these results suggest that Bcor plays a role in differentiation of multiple tissue lineages during early embryonic development.</str>

The characterization of the cells is crucial before any transplantation into any model, e.g. in our case into the mouse brain with the aim to treat a neurodegenerative disease. Specific protein markers (MAP-2, OCT-4, FORSE-1) were detected by immunocytochemistry in the cell cultures. The mRNA expression levels of PAX-6, MASH-1, Brachyury, GATA-4 and AFP were determined by RT qPCR method. HPRT was used as a housekeeping gene. The degree of differentiation can be characterized by expression of analyzed genes. The presence of OCT-4 and FORSE-1 proteins in undifferentiated pluripotent cells and the presence of dendrite specific MAP-2 in neuroprogenitors was detected. The expression levels of PAX-6 and MASH-1 increased and expression of Brachyury decreased during the neurodifferentiation process. The expression levels of GATA-4 and AFP were the highest after induction of differentiation with retinoic acid.

      <str>The molecular mechanism underlying somite development differs along the embryonic antero-posterior axis. In zebrafish, cell lineage tracing and genetic analysis have revealed a difference in somite development between the trunk and tail. For instance, spadetail/tbx16 (spt) mutant embryos lack trunk somites but not tail ones. Trunk and tail somites are developed from mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) located in the tailbud. While the undifferentiated state of MPCs is maintained by mutual activation between Wnt and Brachyury/Ntl, the mechanism by which the MPCs differentiate into presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells remains largely unclear. Especially, the molecules that promote PSM differentiation during tail development should be clarified. Here, we show that zebrafish embryos defective in mesogenin1 (msgn1) and spt failed to differentiate into PSM cells in tail development and show increased expression of wnt8 and ntl. Msgn1 acted in a cell-autonomous manner and as a transcriptional activator in PSM differentiation. The expression of msgn1 initially overlapped with that of ntl in the ventral tailbud, as previously reported; and its mis-expression caused ectopic expression of tbx24, a PSM marker gene, only in the tailbud and posterior notochord, both of which expressed ntl in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, the PSM-inducing activity of misexpressed msgn1 was enhanced by co-expression with ntl. Thus, Msgn1 exercised its PSM-inducing activity in cells expressing ntl. Based on these results, we speculate that msgn1 expression in association with that of ntl may allow the differentiation of progenitor cells to proceed during development of somites in the tail.</str>

      <str>Fgf signaling, mediated in part by the transcription factor Brachyury/Xbra/Ntl, plays important roles in mesoderm formation during the early development of vertebrate embryos. We have identified a zebrafish gene, spr2, which encodes a member of the Sp1-like transcription factor family. spr2 is expressed in both hypoblast and epiblast cells during late blastulation/early gastrulation, and in some mesodermal and neural tissues at later stages. Injection with spr2 mRNA enhances ntl expression and alleviates the inhibitory effect on ntl of XFD, a Xenopus dominant-negative FGF receptor. In contrast, morpholino- mediated knockdown of Spr2 activity inhibits ntl expression and reduces the inductive effect of Fgfs on ntl. We also demonstrate that Fgf signaling relays mesoderm induction activity of Nodal signaling and Spr2 is involved in this signal relay process. Furthermore, the correct spatial expression of spr2 requires Nodal, Fgf and Wnt signals. We suggest that expression of spr2 is an immediate-early response to mesoderm induction by Fgfs, which in turn regulates the expression of effector genes involved in the development of mesodermal tissues.</str>

      <str>T-domain transcription factors are involved in many different processes during embryogenesis, such as mesoderm, heart or gut development in vertebrates and in invertebrates. In insects, the following five types of T-box genes are known: brachyenteron (byn), optomotor-blind (omb), optomotor-blind-related-gene-1 (org-1), dorsocross (doc) and H15. As all these classes are present in the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the flour beetle Tribolium, the multiplicity of the five types of genes varies from dipterans to the beetle. In higher dipterans, a small cluster of three doc genes (doc1-doc3) exists, while the Tribolium genome contains a single Tc-doc gene only. Two H15 genes, Tc-H15a and Tc-H15b, are present in the Tribolium genome compared to a single H15 gene in Drosophila. We have analysed the expression and function of the Tribolium brachyenteron ortholog (Tc-byn). During embryogenesis, Tc-byn is exclusively expressed in the growth zone of the extending germband and later becomes confined to the distal proctodeum and the hindgut, a situation that parallels the expression pattern of byn in Drosophila. Tc-byn-RNAi treated embryos phenocopy Drosophila byn mutants and form no hindgut. In addition, we have characterised a regulatory element upstream of the Tc-byn transcription start site that confers specific gene expression in the developing hindgut of the Drosophila embryo. Our results demonstrate a highly conserved role for Brachyury-type transcriptional regulators in posterior gut development of insects at the level of expression, function and regulation.</str>

      <str>A characteristic abnormality of chimeras composed of wildtype and T/T (Brachyury) mutant embryonic stem cells is the aggregation and accumulation of mutant cells in the primitive streak and its descendant, the tail bud (V. Wilson, L. Manson, W. C. Skarnes, and R. S. P. Beddington (1995). Development 121, 877-886). To demonstrate that this aberrant behaviour of mutant cells in the streak is due only to the absence of wild-type T protein and to investigate dosage effects of T function on cell deployment during gastrulation, a vector expressing T under the control of its own promoter (which results in T expression in the primitive streak but not in the notochord) was introduced into T/T mutant ES cells carrying a ubiquitous lacZ lineage marker. Four clones (TR clones) that express T appropriately in the streak and rescue abnormal chimeric morphology were recovered. In chimeras, these four clones fall into two distinct categories with respect to their ability to exit from the primitive streak and their subsequent tissue colonisation profile. TR1 and TR4 descendants no longer accumulated in the tail bud and gave rise to all types of mesoderm as well as colonising ventral neurectoderm. Interestingly, TR2 and TR5 cells (which express higher levels of T protein than TR1 and TR4 in vitro) tended to exit the streak prematurely, showed a marked reduction in posterior mesoderm colonisation, and were virtually excluded from ventral neurectoderm. However, while descendants of all four TR clones can colonise dermomyotome at all axial levels, the parent T/T mutant cells only contribute to this tissue rostral to the forelimb bud and are completely excluded from more caudal dermomyotome. These results show that the abnormal aggregation of mutant cells homozygous for the Brachyury deletion (approximately 200 kb) can be ascribed solely to the lack of wild-type T protein, as can the failure of T/T cells to colonise caudal dermomyotome. They also suggest that patterns of cell recruitment from the streak can be influenced by the level of T expression.</str>

      <str>Although largely involved in innate and adaptive immunity, NF-kappa B plays an important role in vertebrate development. In chicks, the inactivation of the NF-kappa B pathway induces functional alterations of the apical ectodermal ridge, which mediates limb outgrowth. In mice, the complete absence of NF-kappa B activity leads to prenatal death and neural tube defects. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of NF-kappa B/I kappa B proteins in zebra fish. Despite being ubiquitously expressed among the embryonic tissues, NF-kappa B/I kappa B members present distinct patterns of gene expression during the early zebra fish development. Biochemical assays indicate that zebra fish NF-kappa B proteins are able to bind consensus DNA-binding (kappa B) sites and inhibitory I kappa B alpha proteins from mammals. We show that zebra fish I kappa B alphas are degraded in a time-dependent manner after induction of transduced murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and that these proteins are able to rescue NF-kappa B activity in I kappa B alpha(-/-) MEFs. Expression of a dominant-negative form of the murine I kappa B alpha (mI kappa B alpha M), which is able to block NF-kappa B in zebra fish cells, interferes with the notochord differentiation, generating no tail (ntl)-like embryos. This phenotype can be rescued by coinjection of the T-box gene ntl (Brachyury homologue), which is typically required for the formation of posterior mesoderm and axial development, suggesting that ntl lies downstream of NF-kappa B . We further show that ntl and Brachyury promoter regions contain functional kappa B sites and NF-kappa B can directly modulate ntl expression. Our study illustrates the conservation and compatibility of NF-kappa B/I kappa B proteins among vertebrates and the importance of NF-kappa B pathway in mesoderm formation during early embryogenesis.</str>

      <str>The formation of a through-gut was a key innovation in the evolution of metazoans. There is still controversy regarding the origin of the anus and how it may have been either gained or lost during evolution in different bilaterian taxa. Thus, the study of groups with a blind gut is of great importance for understanding the evolution of this organ system. Here, we describe the morphogenesis and molecular patterning of the blind gut in the sexual triclad Schmidtea polychroa. We identify and analyze the expression of goosecoid, commonly associated with the foregut, and the GATA, ParaHox and T-box genes, members of which commonly are associated with gut regionalization. We show that GATA456a is expressed in the blind gut of triclads, while GATA456b is localized in dorsal parenchymal cells. Goosecoid is expressed in the central nervous system, and the unique ParaHox gene identified, Xlox, is detected in association with the nervous system. We have not isolated any brachyury gene in the T-box complement of S. polychroa, which consists of one tbx1/10, three tbx2/3 and one tbx20. Furthermore, the absence of genes like brachyury and caudal is also present in other groups of Platyhelminthes. This study suggests that GATA456, in combination with foxA, is a gut-specific patterning mechanism conserved in the triclad S. polychroa, while the conserved gut-associated expression of foregut, midgut and hindgut markers is absent. Based on these data and the deviations in spiral cleavage found in more basal flatworms, we propose that the lack of an anus is an innovation of Platyhelminthes. This may be associated with loss of gut gene expression or even gene loss.</str>

      <str>Definitive mesoderm arises from a bipotent mesendodermal population, and to study processes controlling its development at this stage, embryonic stem (ES) cells can be employed. SHB (Src homology 2 protein in beta-cells) is an adapter protein previously found to be involved in ES cell differentiation to mesoderm. To further study the role of SHB in this context, we have established ES cell lines deficient for one (SHB+/-) or both SHB alleles (SHB-/-). Differentiating embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from these ES cell lines were used for gene expression analysis. Alternatively, EBs were stained for the blood vessel marker CD31. For hematopoietic differentiation, EBs were differentiated in methylcellulose. SHB-/- EBs exhibited delayed down-regulation of the early mesodermal marker Brachyury. Later mesodermal markers relatively specific for the hematopoietic, vascular, and cardiac lineages were expressed at lower levels on day 6 or 8 of differentiation in EBs lacking SHB. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 was also reduced in SHB-/- EBs. SHB-/- EBs demonstrated impaired blood vessel formation after vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation. In addition, the SHB-/- ES cells formed fewer blood cell colonies than SHB+/+ ES cells. It is concluded that SHB is required for appropriate hematopoietic and vascular differentiation and that delayed down-regulation of Brachyury expression may play a role in this context.</str>

      <str>Echinoderms are the sister group of the chordates and hemichordates within the deuterostomes. They lack a notochord or any structures obviously homologous with it. To gain insight into developmental mechanisms important in the origin and early evolution of chordates, we investigated sea urchin homologues of chordate genes that are implicated in notochord formation, viz. Brachyury and HNF-3 beta. Here we report the pattern of expression of a sea urchin orthologue of forkhead, Hphnf3 which is present as a single copy per haploid genome. An Hphnf3 transcript of 3.0 kb was first detected at the swimming blastula stage, accumulated maximally at the gastrula and prism-embryo stages, and decreased at the pluteus-larva stage. In situ hybridization signals were found in cells of the vegetal plate of the swimming blastula. During gastrulation, intense staining was evident in the cells surrounding the blastopore, whereas weak staining was detected in the invaginating archenteron. At the prism-embryo stage, the entire archenteron stained intensely; then, at pluteus stage, the larva staining decreased in intensity. The forkhead and Brachyury genes begin to be expressed almost simultaneously in sea urchin embryos, in the vegetal plate at the late blastula stage. After the onset of gastrulation, however, Hphnf3 is expressed in the posterior part of the archenteron, whereas the Brachyury orthologue, HpTa, is expressed in the secondary mesenchyme founder cells, which occupy the anterior tip of archenteron. Hphnf3 may contribute to specification of embryonic cells as archenteron, and the role of HpTa may be directed towards specification of mesodermal founder cells. Except for the basal character of expression in endoderm and endomesoderm, these transcription factors are clearly utilized differently in chordates.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare embryogenetic tumors, arising from remnants of the notochord, characterized by local invasiveness and variable tendency for recurrence. No molecular markers are currently used in a clinical setting to distinguish chordomas with an indolent or an aggressive pattern. Among the genetic lesions observed in this tumor, one of the most commonly detected is 1p loss. In a previous study we observed 1p36 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 85% of the analyzed chordomas. We studied a group of 16 homogeneously treated skull base chordomas (SBCs), reporting 1p36 LOH in 75% of them and determining the expression pattern of eight apoptotic genes mapped at 1p36. No tumors shared a common expression profile with nucleus pulposus, which is considered the only adult normal tissue deriving from notochord. In particular, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily genes TNFRSF8, TNFRSF9, and TNFRSF14 were differently expressed compared with control in a higher percentage of tumors (40%-53%) than were the remaining analyzed genes, suggesting that the deregulation of these three genes might have a role in chordoma tumorigenesis. The presence/absence of LOH and the expression/nonexpression of each apoptotic gene were studied in a survival analysis. Our results suggest that the lack of 1p36 LOH or the presence of TNFRSF8 expression might be associated with a better prognosis in patients with SBCs.</str>

      <str>Sponges are among the earliest diverging lineage within the metazoan phyla. Although their adult morphology is distinctive, at several stages of development, they possess characteristics found in more complex animals. The T-box family of transcription factors is an evolutionarily ancient gene family known to be involved in the development of structures derived from all germ layers in the bilaterian animals. There is an incomplete understanding of the role that T-box transcription factors play in normal sponge development or whether developmental pathways using the T-box family share similarities between parazoan and eumetazoan animals. To address these questions, we present data that identify several important T-box genes in marine and freshwater sponges, place these genes in a phylogenetic context, and reveal patterns in how these genes are expressed in developing sponges. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that sponges have members of at least two of the five T-box subfamilies (Brachyury and Tbx2/3/4/5) and that the T-box genes expanded and diverged in the poriferan lineage. Our analysis of signature residues in the sponge T-box genes calls into question whether "true" Brachyury genes are found in the Porifera. Expression for a subset of the T-box genes was elucidated in larvae from the marine demosponge, Halichondria bowerbanki. Our results show that sponges regulate the timing and specificity of gene expression for T-box orthologs across larval developmental stages. In situ hybridization reveals distinct, yet sometimes overlapping expression of particular T-box genes in free-swimming larvae. Our results provide a comparative framework from which we can gain insights into the evolution of developmentally important pathways.</str>

      <str>Here we describe methods for the clonal expansion of engineered hESCs and make available a suite of lentiviral vectors for that combine Blasticidin, Neomycin and Puromycin resistance based drug selection of pure populations of stem cells and cardiomyocytes with ubiquitous or lineage-specific promoters that direct expression of fluorescent proteins to visualize and track cardiomyocytes and their progenitors. The phospho-glycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was used to ubiquitously direct expression of histone-2B fused eGFP and mCherry proteins to the nucleus to monitor DNA content and enable tracking of cell migration and lineage. Vectors with T/Brachyury and alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoters targeted fluorescent or drug-resistance proteins to early mesoderm and cardiomyocytes. The drug selection protocol yielded 96% pure cardiomyocytes that could be cultured for over 4 months. Puromycin-selected cardiomyocytes exhibited a gene expression profile similar to that of adult human cardiomyocytes and generated force and action potentials consistent with normal fetal cardiomyocytes, documenting these parameters in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes and validating that the selected cells retained normal differentiation and function.</str>

      <str>Tenascin is a large glycoprotein which is expressed in a restricted pattern in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of vertebrate embryos. Tenascin interferes with cell-fibronectin interactions in vitro, and may play a role in the control of cell migration and differentiation during development. In Xenopus, tenascin immunoreactivity is first detected at the early tailbud stage in the ECM of the most anterior somite. Thereafter, it is distributed dorsally along neural crest cell migration pathways. In this paper, we report that tenascin mRNA is most abundant in dorsal mesoderm at the neurula stage and in somites at the early tailbud stage, indicating that the initial accumulation of tenascin in the ECM is due to secretion from paraxial mesoderm. To understand how tenascin expression in somitic mesoderm is controlled, we have expressed Xbra and the myogenic factors XMyoD and XMyf5 in blastula animal cap tissue. The tenascin gene is activated by all three transcription factors. Interestingly, expression of tenascin mRNA, and accumulation of the protein in the ECM, can occur without formation of muscle. Our results suggest that tenascin regionalization in early Xenopus embryos depends on tenascin RNA expression by somitic mesoderm, where it is likely to be activated by myogenic factors.</str>

      <str>To investigate formation of the three primary germ layers in mouse embryoid bodies (EBs), we observed changes in structure and gene expression over a 7-day culture period. We compared these changes using two methods for EB formation: hanging drop (HD) and static suspension culture (SSC). Light microscopy showed that a stratified columnar epithelial layer developed on the surface of EBs formed using the HD method. From Day 3 in culture, ultrastructural changes occurred in the aligned cellular membranes. Condensation of actin filaments was followed by formation of complicated adherent junctions and dilatation of intercellular canaliculi containing well-developed microvilli. These changes were more marked in EBs formed by the HD method than the SSC method. On Day 5 of culture, Brachyury gene expression, a marker for mesoderm formation, was detected only with the HD method. Nestin, an ectoderm marker, and Foxa2, an endoderm marker, were expressed with both methods. These results suggest that in EBs formed with the HD method, actin formation and Brachyury gene expression mark the transition from two to three primary germ layers. Additionally, the HD method promotes more rapid and complete development of mouse EBs than does the SSC method. While the SSC method is simple and easy to use, it needs improvement to form more complete EBs.</str>

      <str>goosecoid is an immediate early gene expressed at the dorsal blastoporal lip of the Xenopus gastrula. Microinjection experiments have suggested a direct role for goosecoid in organizing the dorsoventral axis of the frog embryo. Here we characterize the zebrafish homologue of goosecoid (gsc) and compare its expression to that of Brachyury or no tail (ntl), another immediate early gene required in developing mesoderm. We show that gsc exhibits two independent phases of expression: an early one in cells anterior to the presumptive notochord, but not in cells of the notochord itself, and a later one in neural crest derivatives in the larval head. Zygotic gsc transcripts are detected soon after the midblastula transition, and at the blastula stage form a gradient with a maximum at the dorsal side. Use of gsc as a dorsal marker allowed us to demonstrate that ntl expression is initially activated at the dorsal side of the blastula. At this early stage, gsc and ntl show overlapping domains of expression and are co-expressed in cells at the dorsal midline of the early gastrula. However, gsc- and ntl-expressing cells become separated in the course of gastrulation, with gsc being expressed in the axial hypoblast (prechordal plate) anterior to the ntl-expressing presumptive notochord cells. Studies with mutant embryos suggest that gsc is independent of ntl function in vivo.</str>

      <str>Patterning events that occur before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) and that organize the spatial pattern of gene expression in the animal hemisphere have been analyzed in Xenopus embryos. We present evidence that genes that play a role in dorsoventral specification display different modes of activation. Using early blastomere explants (16-128-cell stage) cultured until gastrula stages, we demonstrate by RT-PCR analysis that the expression of goosecoid (gsc), wnt-8 and brachyury (bra) is dependent on mesoderm induction. In contrast, nodal-related 3 (nr3) and siamois (sia) are expressed in a manner that is independent of mesoderm induction, however their spatially correct activation does require cortical rotation. The pattern of sia and nr3 expression reveals that the animal half of the 16-cell embryo is already distinctly polarized along the dorsoventral axis as a result of rearrangement of the egg structure during cortical rotation. Similar to the antagonistic activity between the ventral and the dorsal mesoderm, the ventral animal blastomeres can attenuate the expression of nr3 and sia in dorsal animal blastomeres. Our data suggest that no Nieuwkoop center activity at the blastula stage is required for the activation of nr3 and sia in vivo.</str>

      <str>Tissue specification in the early embryo requires the integration of spatial information at the promoters of developmentally important genes. Although several response elements for signalling pathways have been identified in Xenopus promoters, it is not yet understood what defines the sharp borders that restrict expression to a specific tissue. Here we use transgenic frog embryos to study the spatial and temporal regulation of the Xbra promoter. Deletion analysis and point mutations in putative transcription factor-binding sites identified two repressor modules, which exert their main effects at different stages during gastrulation. One module is defined by a bipartite binding site for a Smad-interacting protein (SIP1) of the deltaEF1 repressor family and acts to confine expression to the marginal zone early in gastrulation. The other module is defined by two homeodomain-binding sites and is responsible for repression in dorsal mesoderm and ectoderm at mid-gastrula stages. In addition, an upstream region of the promoter is necessary to repress expression in neural tissues later in development. Together, our results show that repression plays an important role in the restriction of Xbra expression to the mesoderm, and we suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in the spatial regulation of other genes in early embryonic development.</str>

      <str>Advancements in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) research have potential to revolutionize therapeutic transplantation. It has been demonstrated that transcription factors may play key roles in regulating maintenance, expansion, and differentiation of hPSCs. In addition to its regulatory functions in hematopoiesis and blood-related disorders, the transcription factor RUNX1 is also required for the formation of definitive blood stem cells. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of endogenous RUNX1a, an isoform of RUNX1, parallels with lineage commitment and hematopoietic emergence from hPSCs, including both human embryonic stem cells and inducible pluripotent stem cells. In a defined hematopoietic differentiation system, ectopic expression of RUNX1a facilitates emergence of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and positively regulates expression of mesoderm and hematopoietic differentiation-related factors, including Brachyury, KDR, SCL, GATA2, and PU.1. HPCs derived from RUNX1a hPSCs show enhanced expansion ability, and the ex vivo-expanded cells are capable of differentiating into multiple lineages. Expression of RUNX1a in embryoid bodies (EBs) promotes definitive hematopoiesis that generates erythrocytes with β-globin production. Moreover, HPCs generated from RUNX1a EBs possess ≥9-week repopulation ability and show multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. Together, our results suggest that RUNX1a facilitates the process of producing therapeutic HPCs from hPSCs.</str>

      <str>The heart is the first organ to form and function in the vertebrate embryo. Furthermore, differences between the left and right sides of the embryo become first detectable during cardiac development. We observed strong cardiac laterality phenotypes in medaka embryos by manipulating Groucho protein activity. The phenotypes produced by misexpressing Tle4 and the dominant-negative Aes reveal a general effect of these corepressor proteins on left-right (LR) development. With the help of an inducible expression system, we were able to define temporally different phases for these effects. In an early phase during gastrulation, Groucho proteins regulate Brachyury expression in the dorsal forerunner cells, which later gives rise to the Kupffer's vesicle (KV). The interference of endogenous Groucho proteins by misexpression of Aes leads to KVs of reduced size, whereas overexpression of Tle4 results in enlarged KVs. The expression level of the cilia marker Lrd was also affected both positively and negatively from these treatments. In the late phase during somitogenesis, Groucho proteins regulate the asymmetric activities of Nodal and Lefty genes. Altering canonical Wnt signaling produced similar results in late embryos, however, this did not affect KV morphogenesis or Lrd expression in early embryos. Therefore, changes in Kupffer's vesicle morphogenesis and the laterality of visceral organs following alterations in Groucho corepressor levels demonstrate two distinct phases in which Groucho proteins help establish LR asymmetry in medaka fish.</str>

      <str>Short, hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp-4) was delivered to early postimplantation staged mouse embryos via tail vein injection of pregnant dams. As early as 24 h postinjection, embryos expressed a DsRed marker and later exhibited defects of neural fold elevation and closure and of cardiac morphogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of sectioned embryos indicated that Bmp-4 protein was depleted and gene expression analysis indicated there was a reduction in Bmp-4 mRNA and an upregulation of the Bmp-4 antagonists, noggin and chordin, in embryos exposed to the shRNA, but not in control embryos. There was no change in the expression of Gata4, brachyury, or claudin6 in RNAi exposed embryos, indicating that RNA silencing was specific to Bmp-4 rather than producing widespread gene inhibition. Delivery of shRNA to embryos has the potential to specifically knockdown the expression of developmentally essential genes and to rescue gene mutations, significantly decreasing the time required to analyze the function(s) of individual genes in development.</str>

      <str>The murine Brachyury (T) gene is required in mesoderm formation. Mutants carrying different T alleles show a graded severity of defects correlated with gene dosage along the body axis. The phenotypes range from shortening of the tail to the malformation of sacral vertebrae in heterozygotes, and to disruption of trunk development and embryonic death in homozygotes. Defects include a severe disturbance of the primitive streak, an early cessation of mesoderm formation and absence of the allantois and notochord, the latter resulting in an abnormality of the neural tube and somites. The T gene is expressed in nascent mesoderm and in the notochord of wild-type embryos. Here the expression of T in whole-mount mutant embryos homozygous for the T allele TWis is described. The TWis gene product is altered, but the TWis/TWis phenotype is very similar to that of T/T embryos which lack T. In early TWis/TWis embryos T expression is normal, but ceases prematurely during early organogenesis coincident with a cessation of mesoderm formation. The archenteron/node region is disrupted and the extension of the notochord precursor comes to a halt, followed by a decrease and finally a complete loss of T gene expression in the primitive streak and the head process/notochord precursor. It appears that the primary defect of the mutant embryo is the disruption of the notochord precursor in the node region which is required for axis elongation. Thus the T gene product is directly or indirectly involved in the organization of axial development.</str>

This tumor shares many of the clinical and histologic features of classic chordoma and chondrosarcoma and has been shown to have a better prognosis than either of these lesions. To the best of our knowledge, no ultrastructural studies have been performed in the 26 cases of chondroid chordoma published previously. We document the ultrastructural features of two examples of chondroid chordoma. Certain features such as prominent and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, intracytoplasmic glycogen aggregates, and abundant fibrillogranular matrix are common to chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and chondroid chordoma. The presence of well-formed tonofilament desmosome complexes as well as complexes composed of alternating profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were seen only in chordoma and chondroid chordoma, but not in cartilaginous tumors. Of particular interest was the finding of crystalline, tubular structures within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of both cases of chondroid chordoma, a finding not described previously. The distinction of chondroid chordoma from classical chordoma is said to be a difficult one at the light-microscopic level, and we suggest that these intraergastoplasmic tubular structures might constitute an extremely helpful differential marker.</str>

T/T mutant embryos develop normally to the primitive streak stage; during early organogenesis they show insufficient mesoderm and absence of the notochord. The mutants die at around 10 days of gestation because of the lack of the allantois. We have localized the T mutation relative to DNA markers and used a combination of genetic and molecular techniques to clone the T gene. Expression of the T gene is restricted to nascent mesoderm and to the notochord, the tissues most strongly affected by the mutation. Recent results suggest that the T gene encodes a nuclear factor involved in establishing notochord cell identity and differentiation, and is directly or indirectly involved in the organization of axial development.</str>

      <str>The zebrafish T-box transcription factors spadetail (spt) and the brachyury ortholog no tail (ntl) are together essential for posterior mesoderm formation. In addition to being functionally redundant, spt and ntl also genetically interact with zygotic mutant alleles of one-eyed pinhead (Zoep), leading to synergistic mesodermal defects. Here we have used genetic and pharmacological assays to address the mechanism of these interactions. We show that Zoep and ntl are together required upstream of spt expression, accounting for the severity of the mesodermal defects in Zoep;ntl embryos. Since Xenopus brachyury is proposed to regulate fgf expression, and FGF signaling is required for spt expression, we analyzed the involvement of the FGF signaling pathway in these genetic interactions. Using a specific inhibitor of FGFR activity to indirectly assay the strength of FGF signaling in individual embryos, we found that spt and ntl mutant embryos were both hypersensitive to the FGFR inhibitor. This hypersensitivity is consistent with the possibility that Spt and Ntl function upstream of FGF signaling. Furthermore, we show that minor pharmacological or genetic perturbations in FGF signaling are sufficient to dramatically enhance the Zoep mutant phenotype, providing a plausible explanation for why Zoep genetically interacts with spt and ntl. Finally, we show that Zoep and ace/fgf8 function are essential for the formation of all posterior tissues, including spinal cord. Taken together, our data provide strong in vivo support for the regulation of FGF signaling by T-box transcription factors, and the cooperative activity of Oep and FGF signaling during the formation of posterior structures.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are low to intermediate grade malignancies that arise from remnants of embryonic notochord. They often recur after surgery and are highly resistant to conventional adjuvant therapies. Recently, the development of effective targeted molecular therapy has been investigated in chordomas that show receptors for tyrosine kinase (RTKs) activation. Expression of specific RTKs such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) in chordomas may offer valuable therapeutic options. We investigated changes in copy number of chromosome 7 and correlated it with EGFR gene status and EGFR and c-MET protein expression in 22 chordoma samples. Chromosome 7 copy number was evaluated by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and protein expression of EGFR and c-MET by immunohistochemistry. Tumors mostly showed conventional histopathologic features and were found mainly in sacral (41%) and cranial sites (54.5%). Aneusomy of chromosome 7 was seen in 73% of the samples, 62% of primary tumors and in all recurrent chordomas. EGFR and c-MET were both expressed, but only c-MET protein expression was significantly correlated with chromosome 7 aneusomy (P ≤ 0.001). c-MET overexpression may represent an early chromosome 7 alteration that could play an important role during chordoma pathogenesis. c-MET overexpression shows promise as a molecular marker of response to targeted molecular therapy in the treatment of chordomas.</str>

We have investigated the effect of administering recombinant FGF-4 in the late-primitive streak stage embryo to test if the patterning of the body plan may be influenced by this growth factor. Shortly after FGF treatment the embryonic tissues up-regulated the expression of Brachyury and the RTK signaling regulator Spry2, suggesting that FGF signaling was activated as an immediate response to exogenous FGF. Concomitantly, Hesx1 expression was suppressed in the prospective anterior region of the embryo. After 24 h of in vitro development, embryos displayed a dosage-related suppression of forebrain morphogenesis, disruption of the midbrain-hindbrain partition, and inhibition of the differentiation of the embryonic mesoderm. Overall, development of the anterior-posterior axis in the late gastrula is sensitive to the delivery of exogenous FGF-4. The early response associated with the expression of Spry2 suggests that the later phenotype observed could be primarily related to an inhibition of the FGF signaling pathway.</str>

      <str>The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is associated with extensive changes in gene expression. It is not yet clear whether these changes are the result of binary switch-like mechanisms or that of continuous and progressive variation. Here, I have used immunostaining and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess changes in the expression of the well-known pluripotency-associated gene Pou5f1 (also known as Oct4) and early differentiation markers Sox1 and T-brachyury in single cells during the early steps of differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. I found extensive overlap between the expression of Pou5f1/Sox1 or Pou5f1/T-brachyury shortly after the initiation of differentiation towards either the neuronal or the mesendodermal lineage, but no evidence of correlation between their respective expression levels. Quantitative analysis of transcriptional output at the sites of nascent transcription revealed that Pou5f1 and Sox1 were transcribed in pulses and that embryonic stem cell differentiation was accompanied by changes in pulsing frequencies. The progressive induction of Sox1 was further associated with an increase in the average size of individual transcriptional bursts. Surprisingly, single cells that actively and simultaneously transcribe both the pluripotency- and the lineage-associated genes could easily be found in the differentiating population. The results presented here show for the first time that lineage priming can occur in cells that are actively transcribing a pluripotent marker. Furthermore, they suggest that this process is associated with changes in transcriptional dynamics. Stem Cells 2015;33:2949-2960. </str>

Cell viability, cell morphology and DNA content, extracellular matrix production and expression of genes related to NC markers (Brachyury, KRT18) and NP matrix production (ACAN, COL2A1, COL1A1) were assessed after 1, 15 and 28 days of culture.</str>
      <str>NCs did not completely maintain their phenotype (morphology, matrix production, gene expression) during 28 days of culture. In cocultures of NPCs and NCs, both extracellular matrix content and anabolic gene expression remained unchanged compared with monoculture groups, whereas cocultures of MSCs and NCs showed increased glycosaminoglycan/DNA. However, the deposition of these proteoglycans was observed near the NCs and not the MSCs. Brachyury expression in the MSC and NC coculture group increased in time. The latter two findings indicate a trophic effect of MSCs on NCs rather than vice versa.</str>
      <str>No regenerative potential of canine NCs on canine NPCs or MSCs was observed in this study. However, significant changes in NC phenotype in long-term culture may have resulted in a suboptimal regenerative potential of these NCs. In this respect, NC-conditioned medium may be better than coculture for future studies of the regenerative potential of NCs.</str>

      <str>The widespread expression of the Xenopus homeobox gene Xhox3 in zebrafish was performed by microinjection of synthetic Xhox3 mRNA into uncleaved fertilized eggs and resulted in embryos displaying varying degrees of anterior-posterior (A-P) axis disruption. The phenotype observed was dose-dependent and showed anomalies, mainly in neural keel development, from microphthalmia to acephaly. Injection of 5 pg to 10 pg of mRNA caused a range of phenotypes in prim 5 stage embryos from normal to acephalic. Anomalies have been categorized according to an index of axis deficiency (Zf-IAD). We further characterized the axis disturbance by analyzing the expression of two genes implicated in axis formation: engrailed (eng) and brachyury (ntl). eng could not be detected in the muscle pioneer cells of embryos injected with Xhox3. The pattern distribution of brachyury (Ntl) protein is abnormal in Xhox3 injected embryos. Evidence for the conservation of the NH2 terminal region of the Xhox3 protein in frogs and fish is provided by the detection of a nuclear Xhox3-like protein in 24 h zebrafish embryos located in posterior mesoderm tissue. Previous results in Xenopus embryo research and the data presented here support the conservation of an A-P patterning mechanism involving the Xhox3 gene.</str>

      <str>During the early vertebrate body plan formation, convergent extension (CE) of dorsal mesoderm and neurectoderm is coordinated by the evolutionarily conserved non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling. Disheveled (Dvl), a key mediator of Wnt/PCP signaling, is essential for the medial-lateral polarity formation in the cells undergoing convergent extension movements. NEDD4L, a highly conserved HECT type E3 ligase, has been reported to regulate the stability of multiple substrates including Dvl2. Here we demonstrate that NEDD4L is required for the cellular polarity formation and convergent extension in the early Xenopus embryos. Depletion of NEDD4L in early Xenopus embryos results in the loss of mediolateral polarity of the convergent-extending mesoderm cells and the shortened body axis, resembling those defects caused by the disruption of non-canonical Wnt signaling. Depletion of xNEDD4L also blocks the elongation of the animal explants in response to endogenous mesoderm inducing signals and partially compromises the expression of Brachyury. Importantly, reducing Dvl2 expression can largely rescue the cellular polarity and convergent extension defects in NEDD4L-depleted embryos and explants. Together with the data that NEDD4L reduces Dvl2 protein expression in the frog embryos, our findings suggest that regulation of Dvl protein levels by NEDD4L is essential for convergent extension during early Xenopus embryogenesis. </str>

      <str>Cellular differentiation and lineage commitment are considered to be robust and irreversible processes during development. Recent work has shown that mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors. We hypothesized that combinatorial expression of chondrocyte-specific transcription factors could directly convert human placental cells into chondrocytes. Starting from a pool of candidate genes, we identified a combination of only five genes (5F pool)-BCL6, T (also called BRACHYURY), c-MYC, MITF, and BAF60C (also called SMARCD3)-that rapidly and efficiently convert postnatal human chorion and decidual cells into chondrocytes. The cells generated expressed multiple cartilage-specific genes, such as Collagen type II α1, LINK PROTEIN-1, and AGGRECAN, and exhibited characteristics of cartilage both in vivo and in vitro. Expression of the endogenous genes for T and MITF was initiated, implying that the cell conversion is due to not only the forced expression of the transgenes, but also to cellular reprogramming by the transgenes. This direct conversion system from noncartilage tissue to cartilaginous tissue is a substantial advance toward understanding cartilage development, cell-based therapy, and oncogenesis of chondrocytes.</str>

      <str>Early degenerative changes in the nucleus pulposus (NP) are observed after the disappearance of notochordal cells (NCs). Thus, it has been suggested that NCs play an important role in maintaining the NP and may have a regenerative potential on other cells of the NP. As the number of resident NP cells (NPCs) decreases in a degenerating disc, mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) may be used for cell supplementation. In this study, using cells of one species, the regenerative potential of canine NCs was assessed in long-term 3D co-culture with canine NPCs or MSCs.</str>

      <str>The vertebrate somite is the source of all trunk skeletal muscles. Myogenesis in avian embryos is thought to depend on signals from notochord and neural tube for the epaxial muscles, and signals from lateral mesoderm and surface ectoderm for the hypaxial muscles. However, this hypothesis has to be tested because in mouse mutants lacking a notochord the presence of a fused myotome beneath the neural tube has been reported. We have compared the expression pattern of myogenic markers and markers for the hypaxial muscle precursors in the mutants Brachyury curtailed, truncate, Danforth's short tail and Pintail. In regions lacking notochord and sclerotome, we found small, ventrally located domains of Myf5 and MyoD expression, concomitant with ventrally expanded Pax3 signals and upregulated expression of the hypaxial marker Lbx1, suggesting that only the hypaxial program is active. We therefore hypothesise that in mammals, as in birds, the formation of the epaxial musculature depends on the presence of notochord derived signals.</str>

      <str>The T (Brachyury) gene, which encodes a transcription factor, is involved in the formation of posterior mesoderm. Although studies in Xenopus have shown that T gene expression is responsive to mesoderm inducing factors and furthermore suggest the existence of an autoregulatory loop involving T itself, eFGF, and the FGF receptor, little is known about the regulation of T expression in the mouse. We report here that in the mouse the expression of fgf-4, the putative homologue of Xenopus efgf, is not dependent on the presence of T protein during the first 48 hr of gastrulation. Furthermore, we address the question of autoregulation using a chimeric approach. Introduction of a T promoter-lacZ construct into T/T ES cells results in T promoter activity in the primitive streak and tail bud in the absence of functional T protein. Therefore, we suggest that a direct FGF and T autoregulatory loop is unlikely to operate during gastrulation and axis elongation in the mouse.</str>

      <str>A major challenge facing the development of effective cell therapies is the efficient differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into pure populations. Lowering oxygen tension to physiological levels can affect both the expansion and differentiation stages. However, to date, there are no studies investigating the knock-on effect of culturing PSCs under low oxygen conditions on subsequent lineage commitment at ambient oxygen levels. PSCs were passaged three times at 2% O2 before allowing cells to spontaneously differentiate as embryoid bodies (EBs) in high oxygen (20% O2) conditions. Maintenance of mouse PSCs in low oxygen was associated with a significant increase in the expression of early differentiation markers FGF5 and Eomes, while conversely we observed decreased expression of these genes in human PSCs. Low oxygen preconditioning primed mouse PSCs for their subsequent differentiation into mesodermal and endodermal lineages, as confirmed by increased gene expression of Eomes, Goosecoid, Brachyury, AFP, Sox17, FoxA2, and protein expression of Brachyury, Eomes, Sox17, FoxA2, relative to high oxygen cultures. The effects extended to the subsequent formation of more mature mesodermal lineages. We observed significant upregulation of cardiomyocyte marker Nkx2.5, and critically a decrease in the number of contaminant pluripotent cells after 12 days using a directed cardiomyocyte protocol. However, the impact of low oxygen preconditioning was to prime human cells for ectodermal lineage commitment during subsequent EB differentiation, with significant upregulation of Nestin and β3-tubulin. Our research demonstrates the importance of oxygen tension control during cell maintenance on the subsequent differentiation of both mouse and human PSCs, and highlights the differential effects. </str>

      <str>In the present study, we show that insulin accelerates early morphogenesis in gastrulating chick embryo explants cultured in vitro, whereas antiserum to insulin adversely affects this process. Comparison between length of body axis of control and treated embryos clearly brings out the significant acceleration of development by excess insulin (0.175 to 17.5 nM). In embryos treated with 87.5 and 175 nM insulin, a high occurrence of abnormalities is observed. Treatment of embryos with antiserum to porcine insulin results in a high percentage of abnormalities, particularly in the forming neural tube. In situ hybridization of whole embryos using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes showed that insulin modifies the expression of crucial developmental genes within 2 hours. While Brachyury, a pan-mesodermal marker gene, ERNI, the earliest known marker for neural induction in chick, and noggin, important in neural tube patterning, are upregulated, expression of goosecoid, necessary for gastrulation movements, does not appear to be significantly altered. During the same time, insulin does not exert any mitogenic effect on chick embryonic cells as assessed by nuclear counts. These findings demonstrate that insulin plays an important role in the early morphogenesis of the chick embryo. The function of insulin appears to be mediated by specific genes which orchestrate pattern formation during early development.</str>

      <str>Mutations in the T-box gene Brachyury have well known effects on invagination of the endomesodermal layer during gastrulation, but the gene also plays a role in the determination of left/right axis determination that is less well studied. Previous work has implicated node morphology in this effect. We use the T(Wis) allele of Brachyury to investigate the molecular and morphological effects of the T locus on axis determination in the mouse.</str>
      <str>Similar to embryos mutant for the T allele, T(Wis) /T(Wis) embryos have a high incidence of ventral and/or reversed heart looping. In addition, heterotaxia between the direction of heart looping and the direction of embryo turning is common. Scanning electron microscopy reveals defects in node morphology including irregularity, smaller size, and a decreased number of cilia, although the cilia appear morphologically normal. Molecular analysis shows a loss of perinodal expression of genes involved in Nodal signaling, namely Cer2, Gdf1, and Nodal itself. There is also loss of Dll1 expression, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, in the presomitic mesoderm.</str>
      <str>Morphological abnormalities of the node as well as disruptions of the molecular cascade of left/right axis determination characterize T(Wis) /T(Wis) mutants. Decreased Notch signaling may account for both the morphological defects and the absence of expression of genes in the Nodal signaling pathway.</str>

      <str>The mouse T (Brachyury) gene is required for early mesodermal patterning. Mice homozygous for mutations in T die at midgestation and display defects in mesodermal tissues such as the notochord, the allantois and the somitic mesoderm. To examine the role of T in patterning of somitic and posterior mesoderm along the anterior-posterior axis, we have examined the expression of a panel of molecular markers normally localized to the sub-set of cell types affected in TWis mutant mice. Through the use of whole-mount antibody double labelling techniques, we have analysed the spatial relationships of distinct mesodermal populations relative to cells expressing the T protein. We have also examined the consequences of the TWis mutation on mesodermal populations recognised by these markers. We demonstrate that TWis homozygous mutants retain the ability to form notochordal precursor cells, as identified both by the T antibody and the expression of sonic hedgehog/vertebrate homolog of hedgehog 1 (Shh/vhh-1) and goosecoid, however, these cells fail to proliferate or differentiate. These early notochordal defects appear to result in aberrant somitic differentiation as revealed by the distribution of mox-1 protein and twist RNA expression. Moreover, twist expression in paraxial mesoderm appears to be dependent on normal T activity, while Shh/vhh-1, goosecoid, mox-1 and cdx-4 are not T dependent. We propose that T is required for the maintenance of notochordal tissue and subsequent signals required for somite differentiation.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are slow-growing, malignant tumors of bone that are thought to be derived from the primitive notochord and occur almost exclusively in the axial skeleton. The so-called extra-axial chordoma has been shown to demonstrate identical features to the classic chordoma, except that it is found outside the axial skeleton. Only six cases of extra-axial chordoma have been reported in the literature to date. In this report, we present another case of extra-axial chordoma for the first time originating from the lung parenchyma. A 79-year-old man presented a 7.3-cm-sized cavitary lung mass. Pathologic examination, including immunohistochemical studies, revealed that the mass was a chordoma. We report an extra-axial chordoma for the first time presenting as a lung mass.</str>

      <str>Twelve cases of the chordoma, including 4 cases with metastases, have been examined by light and electron microscopy for a comparison with 5 cases of the human notochord. Observed similarities in the histological and ultrastructural characteristics of the chordoma with those of the notochord suggested the histogenetic origin of the chordoma from the remnant of notochord. A "diffuse pattern" that was seen in the histological appearance of 4 cases of the chordoma, including 2 cases with metastases, was not observed in the notochord and was considered to indicate the malignant nature of such chordoma. Electron microscopy of the physaliphorous cells characteristic of the chordoma demonstrated intracytoplasmic large vacuoles containing glycogen.</str>

      <str>In Xenopus, the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway acting through beta-catenin functions both in establishing the dorso-ventral axis and in patterning the anterior-posterior axis. This pathway also acts in patterning the animal-vegetal axis in sea urchins. However, because sea urchin development is typically indirect, and adult sea urchins have pentamerous symmetry and lack a longitudinal nerve cord, it has not been clear how the roles of the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway in axial patterning in sea urchins and vertebrates are evolutionarily related. The developmental expression patterns of Notch, brachyury, caudal, and eight Wnt genes have now been determined for the invertebrate chordate Amphioxus, which, like sea urchins, has an early embryo that gastrulates by invagination, but like vertebrates, has a later embryo with a dorsal hollow nerve cord that elongates posteriorly from a tail bud. Comparisons of Amphioxus with other deuterostomes suggest that patterning of the ancestral deuterostome embryo along its anterior-posterior axis during the late blastula and subsequent stages involved a posterior signaling center including Wnts, Notch, and transcription factors such as brachyury and caudal. In tunicate embryos, in which cell numbers are reduced and cell fates largely determined during cleavage stages, only vestiges of this signaling center are still apparent; these include localization of Wnt-5 mRNA to the posterior cytoplasm shortly after fertilization and localization of beta-catenin to vegetal nuclei during cleavage stages. Neither in tunicates nor in Amphioxus is there any evidence that the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway functions in establishment of the dorso-ventral axis. Thus, roles for Wnt-signaling in dorso-ventral patterning of embryos may be a vertebrate innovation that arose in connection with the evolution of yolky eggs and gastrulation by extensive involution.</str>

      <str>Developmental transcription factors are key players in animal multicellularity, being members of the T-box family that are among the most important. Until recently, T-box transcription factors were thought to be exclusively present in metazoans. Here, we report the presence of T-box genes in several nonmetazoan lineages, including ichthyosporeans, filastereans, and fungi. Our data confirm that Brachyury is the most ancient member of the T-box family and establish that the T-box family diversified at the onset of Metazoa. Moreover, we demonstrate functional conservation of a homolog of Brachyury of the protist Capsaspora owczarzaki in Xenopus laevis. By comparing the molecular phenotype of C. owczarzaki Brachyury with that of homologs of early branching metazoans, we define a clear difference between unicellular holozoan and metazoan Brachyury homologs, suggesting that the specificity of Brachyury emerged at the origin of Metazoa. Experimental determination of the binding preferences of the C. owczarzaki Brachyury results in a similar motif to that of metazoan Brachyury and other T-box classes. This finding suggests that functional specificity between different T-box classes is likely achieved by interaction with alternative cofactors, as opposed to differences in binding specificity. </str>

      <str>Although FGF signaling plays an integral role in the migration and patterning of mesoderm at gastrulation, the mechanism and downstream targets of FGF activity have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that FGFR1 orchestrates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and morphogenesis of mesoderm at the primitive streak by controlling Snail and E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, we show that FGFR1 functions in mesoderm cell fate specification by positively regulating Brachyury and Tbx6 expression. Finally, we provide evidence that the attenuation of Wnt3a signaling observed in Fgfr1 -/- embryos can be rescued by lowering E-cadherin levels. We propose that modulation of cytoplasmic beta-catenin levels, associated with FGF-induced downregulation of E-cadherin, provides a molecular link between FGF and Wnt signaling pathways at the streak.</str>

      <str>The vertebrate Fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. Two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, Fgf8a and Fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with Fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for Fgf receptors. To investigate the in vivo requirement for Fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing Fgf8b expression in mice. Analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of Fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. We show that the loss of Fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Importantly, Fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as Fgf8b-deficient embryos at E6.5, demonstrating that signaling by Fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. By contrast, during gastrulation, Fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of Fgf8b in mesoderm specification. We show that an increased level of Fgf8a expression, which leads to Fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of Fgf8b. Therefore, different Fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. Importantly, our findings implicate Fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.</str>

      <str>Xmi-er1 is an immediate-early gene encoding a transcriptional regulator whose expression is activated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) during mesoderm induction in Xenopus. In this study, we examined the role of xmi-er1 in embryonic development and mesoderm induction and investigated the importance of various functional domains in the protein sequence. Overexpression of xmi-er1 in embryos resulted in truncations of the anteroposterior axis, with most of the abnormal embryos exhibiting deficiencies in both anterior and posterior structures. Whole mount in situ hybridization for the early mesodermal marker brachyury (Xbra) revealed a dramatic reduction of Xbra expression in xmi-er1-injected embryos, while mesoderm induction assays showed that overexpression of xmi-er1 significantly reduced the percentage of explants induced by FGF-2. Site-directed mutagenesis of several functional domains, including the ELM2 domain, the SANT domain, a putative MEK phosphorylation site, and a proline-rich region showed that only proline 365 in the proline-rich region is required for the effect on embryonic development and mesoderm induction. These data demonstrate that XMI-ER1 is a negative regulator of FGF, perhaps serving to limit the extent of mesoderm formation in vivo, and that this activity is mediated by proline 365.</str>

      <str>The involution of presumptive mesoderm that occurs during amphibian gastrulation is a complex process requiring the coordinated action of a diverse range of cells. We show that cells with distinct morphologies, resembling each of those normally found in the involuting tissue of the Xenopus embryo, are induced in dispersed animal pole cells by different doses of the potent mesoderm-inducing factor activin. Each cell type is induced within a restricted dose range of activin concentrations, the boundaries of which are well demarcated shortly after activin treatment. In contrast, Brachyury and goosecoid, two genes thought to pattern the presumptive mesoderm, and the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, which is expressed in the mesoderm of gastrula stage embryos, are induced by broad, overlapping ranges of high activin concentrations at such early times. Similarly, the response of the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor A, which is expressed normally in ectoderm of gastrula stage embryos, diminishes gradually as the activin concentration increases. Dose windows for the expression of these four genes narrow and become distinct from one another in cell aggregates after several hours in culture, suggesting that activin prompts a dynamic program of gene expression in induced mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Tetrapod fore-and hindlimbs have evolved from the pectoral and pelvic fins of an ancient vertebrate ancestor. In this ancestor, the pectoral fin appears to have arisen following the rostral homeotic recapitulation of an existing pelvic appendage (Tabin and Laufer (1993), Nature 361, 692-693). Thus the basic appendage outgrowth program is reiterated in both tetrapod fore- and hindlimbs and the pectoral and pelvic fins of extant teleost fishes (Sordino et al. (1995) Nature 375, 678-681). Recently a novel family of putative transcription factors, which includes the T (Brachyury) locus, has been identified and dubbed the "T-box' family. In mice, all of these genes have expression patterns indicative of involvement in embryonic induction (Chapman et al. (1996) Dev. Dyn., in press), and four (Tbx2-Tbx5) are represented as two cognate, linked gene pairs (Agulnik et al., (1996), Genetics, in press). We now report that, whereas Tbx2 and Tbx3 are expressed in similar spatiotemporal patterns in both limbs, Tbx5 and Tbx4 expression is primarily restricted to the developing fore- and hindlimb buds, respectively. These observations suggest that T-box genes have played a role in the evolution of fin and limb morphogenesis, and that Tbx5 and Tbx4 may have been divergently selected to play a role in the differential specification of fore- (pectoral) versus hind- (pelvic) limb (fin) identity.</str>

      <str>Differentiation of the principal body axes in the early vertebrate embryo is based on a specific blueprint of gene expression and a series of transient axial structures such as Hensen's node and the notochord of the late gastrulation phase. Prior to gastrulation, the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) of the mouse egg-cylinder or the anterior marginal crescent (AMC) of the rabbit embryonic disc marks the anterior pole of the embryo. For phylogenetic and functional reasons both these entities are addressed here as the mammalian anterior pregastrulation differentiation (APD). However, mouse and rabbit show distinct structural differences in APD and the molecular blueprint, making the search of general rules for axial differentiation in mammals difficult. Therefore, the pig was analysed here as a further species with a mammotypical flat embryonic disc. Using light and electron microscopy and in situ hybridisation for three key genes involved in early development (sox17, nodal and brachyury), two axial structures of early gastrulation in the pig were identified: (1) the anterior hypoblast (AHB) characterised by increased cellular height and density and by sox17 expression, and (2) the early primitive streak characterised by a high pseudostratified epithelium with an almost continuous but unusually thick basement membrane, by localised epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and by brachyury expression in the epiblast. The stepwise appearance of these two axial structures was used to define three stages typical for mammals at the start of gastrulation. Intriguingly, the round shape and gradual posterior displacement of the APD in the pig appear to be species-specific (differing from all other mammals studied in detail to date) but correlate with ensuing specific primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm development. APD and, hence, the earliest axial structure presently known in the mammalian embryo may thus be functionally involved in shaping extraembryonic membranes and, possibly, the specific adult body form.</str>

      <str>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a mandatory coreceptor for many growth factors and morphogens involved in embryonic development; its bioactivity is dictated by complex sulfation motifs embedded within the polymer chain. Using a panel of HS-specific antibodies we have identified a unique HS epitope recognized by antibody HS4C3 that is selectively expressed during differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells along the mesodermal lineage to the hemangioblast stage. The appearance of this high-affinity HS4C3-binding (HS4C3(high)) epitope is transient; the epitope is specifically expressed within the emerging Brachyury(+) (Bry(+)) population and marks those cells that will become fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk1)(+). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separation and colony forming assays revealed that HS4C3(high)/Flk1(+) cells have a dramatically increased potential to form both blast and endothelial colonies, both of which depend upon the HS-binding growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor. Critically, expression of this HS epitope is tightly regulated, disappearing from the cell surface as the resultant hematopoietic lineages mature, in a similar manner to protein markers Bry and Flk1. In vivo studies showed a remarkable correlation with in vitro findings, with expression of HS4C3-binding epitopes restricted to newly formed mesodermal tissues during gastrulation. We believe this is the first time a defined HS epitope has been implicated in a specific developmental pathway and that this provides, in addition, a novel enrichment technique for the isolation of hemangioblasts from mixed differentiated ES cell cultures.</str>

      <str>This study analyzed the spatial and temporal expression pattern of zebrafish wnt11 and the regulation of the expression during zebrafish early development, focusing on the interaction with the no tail (ntl) gene, a zebrafish orthologue of mouse Brachyury (T). Zygotic expression of wnt11 was first detected at the late blastula stage in the blastoderm margin, a presumptive mesoderm region. wnt11 expression coincided with mesoderm induction, and the expression was induced by mesoderm inducers such as the yolk cell (Mizuno, T., Yamaha, E., Wakahara, M., Kuroiwa, A., Takeda, H., 1996. Mesoderm induction in zebrafish. Nature 383, 131-132) or FGFs, indicating that, like ntl, wnt11 is one of the immediate-early genes in mesoderm induction. Initial expression domains of wnt11 and ntl overlapped, and these genes showed a similar response to mesoderm inducers. However, analysis of the ntl mutant embryos suggested that wnt11 and ntl are placed in distinct genetic pathways; the ntl mutation had no effect on wnt11 expression in the blastoderm margin. This was further supported by the result of RNA injection experiments showing that overexpression of Wnt11 did not affect ntl expression in the margin. Thus, wnt11 and ntl expression are induced and maintained independently in their initial phase of expression. In later stages, wnt11 was expressed in various organs, such as the somites, particularly in the developing notochord. Since no wnt gene has been reported to be expressed in the axial mesoderm, which is known to act as a signaling source that patterns the neural tube and somites, zebrafish wnt11 is the first wnt gene expressed in the notochord. Furthermore, in contrast to early expression, wnt11 expression in the notochord depended on Ntl activity. In the ntl mutant in which somite patterning is severely affected, wnt11 expression was completely lost, while another signaling molecule, sonic hedgehog is expressed in the mutant notochord precursor cells (Krauss, S., Concordet, J.-P., Ingham, P.W., 1993. A functionally conserved homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene hh is expressed in tissues with polarizing activity in zebrafish embryos. Cell 75, 1431-1444). wnt11 expression in the somite also shows a characteristic pattern, correlated with the migration and differentiation of slow muscle precursors. These observations suggest a role for wnt11 in patterning the somites.</str>

      <str>Neural tube defects (NTD) together with cardiovascular system defects are the most common malformations in the Polish population (2.05-2.68/1000 newborns). They arise during early embryogenesis and are caused by an improper neural groove closure during the neurulation process. NTD can arise from the influence of specific environmental factors on the foetus. The genetic factor is also very important, because NTDs have multigenetic conditioning. It was suggested that genes connected with the regulation of neurulation could also be involved in NTD aetiology, especially when their deletion or modification leads to neural tube defects in the mouse model. Examples are genes from the PAX family, T (Brachyury), BRCA1 and PDGFRA genes.</str>

In their report of several marker genes that distinguish nucleus pulposus cells from other related cell types, the authors provide novel insights into the notochordal nature of the former. Together with recently published work, their work lends support to the view that all cells present within the nucleus pulposus are derived from the notochord. Hence, the choice of an animal model for disc research should be based on considerations other than the cell loss and replacement by non-notochordal cells.</str>

      <str>Urothelial carcinoma is morphologically heterogeneous and many variant forms have been described. We have encountered several invasive urothelial carcinomas with a unique chordoid morphology characterized by prominent cellular cording and associated myxoid stromal matrix, a pattern closely resembling extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. This morphologic appearance, to our knowledge, has not been formally described in urothelial carcinoma. A series of 166 consecutive invasive urothelial carcinomas were reviewed to identify cases with cellular cording and myxoid stroma. The patient age, sex, tumor stage, morphologic features, association with typical urothelial carcinoma, and clinical outcome were recorded. Immunostains for p63, cytokeratin (CK) 34BE12, CK20, calponin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, oncofetal protein glypican-3, and brachyury were performed on 7 cases. Mucin histochemistry was performed on 8 cases to evaluate the extracellular myxoid material. Eleven of the 166 (7%) consecutive invasive urothelial carcinomas had areas with a chordoid appearance. A total of 12 cases were analyzed including the addition of a consult case. The patients' ages ranged from 50 to 85 years (mean: 68 y); there were 8 males and 4 females. The specimens consisted of 5 cystectomies, 6 transurethral resections, and 1 anterior exenteration with right nephroureterectomy. Morphologically, each case had at least focal areas in which acellular myxoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells. When well developed, the neoplastic cells had scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and were arranged into cords closely mimicking extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, chordoma, mixed tumor/myoepithelioma of soft tissue, and yolk sac tumor. The percentage of tumor with a chordoid appearance ranged from 5% to 95% (mean: 39%; median: 25%). No conventional sarcomatous differentiation, no intracytoplasmic mucin, and no glandular formation were present in any case. All 12 cases had foci of typical urothelial carcinoma present at least focally and a gradual transition to the chordoid pattern was commonly seen. Immunophenotypically, all 7 cases evaluated showed strong immunoreactivity for p63 (nuclear) and CK34BE12 (cytoplasmic). Immunostains for CK20, calponin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, oncofetal protein glypican-3, and brachyury and were negative in the 7 cases studied (0 out of 7), whereas S-100 protein had focal staining (&lt;5%) in 1 case. The myxoid stromal component was diffusely colloidal iron and Alcian blue positive in all 8 cases examined; periodic acid Schiff was negative in all 8 cases, whereas mucicarmine was only focally positive in 2 of 8 cases. Most cases were high stage (pT4: 5, pT3: 4, pT2: 2, and pT1: 1), and 6 of 8 cases (75%) with nodal sampling had metastatic disease. In 1 case, the lymph node metastasis had areas with chordoid morphology. Nine of 12 patients had available follow-up: 2 were dead of disease (1 and 10 mo), 4 were alive with disease (5 to 8 mo) with distant metastasis in 3, and 3 had no evidence of disease at last follow-up (2 to 120 mo). In summary, we describe a morphologic pattern of urothelial carcinoma with a distinct chordoid appearance that may potentially mimic a spectrum of primary vesical and nonvesical neoplasms with myxoid or mucinous components. These carcinomas maintain an immunophenotype characteristic of urothelial carcinoma and usually present with high stage disease.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and hold great promise as models for human development and disease studies, cell-replacement therapies, drug discovery and in vitro cytotoxicity tests. The culture and differentiation of these cells are both complex and expensive, so it is essential to extreme aseptic conditions. hESCs are susceptible to Mycoplasma sp. infection, which is hard to detect and alters stem cell-associated properties. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficacy and cytotoxic effect of Plasmocin(TM) and ciprofloxacin (specific antibiotics used for Mycoplasma sp. eradication) on hESCs. Mycoplasma sp. infected HUES-5 884 (H5 884, stable hESCs H5-brachyury promoter-GFP line) cells were effectively cured with a 14 days Plasmocin(TM) 25 µg/ml treatment (curative treatment) while maintaining stemness characteristic features. Furthermore, cured H5 884 cells exhibit the same karyotype as the parental H5 line and expressed GFP, through up-regulation of brachyury promoter, at day 4 of differentiation onset. Moreover, H5 cells treated with ciprofloxacin 10 µg/ml for 14 days (mimic of curative treatment) and H5 and WA09 (H9) hESCs treated with Plasmocin(TM) 5 µg/ml (prophylactic treatment) for 5 passages retained hESCs features, as judged by the expression of stemness-related genes (TRA1-60, TRA1-81, SSEA-4, Oct-4, Nanog) at mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the presence of specific markers of the three germ layers (brachyury, Nkx2.5 and cTnT: mesoderm; AFP: endoderm; nestin and Pax-6: ectoderm) was verified in in vitro differentiated antibiotic-treated hESCs. In conclusion, we found that Plasmocin(TM) and ciprofloxacin do not affect hESCs stemness and pluripotency nor cell viability. However, curative treatments slightly diminished cell growth rate. This cytotoxic effect was reversible as cells regained normal growth rate upon antibiotic withdrawal. </str>

      <str>The kidney is formed from two tissue populations derived from the intermediate mesoderm, the ureteric bud, and the metanephric mesenchyme. Metanephric mesenchyme is a pluripotent renal stem population, and conversion of renal mesenchyme into epithelia depends on the ureteric bud in vivo and in vitro. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been induced to differentiate into a broad spectrum of specialized cell types in vitro, including hematopoietic, pancreatic, and neuronal cells. Such ES-derived cells can provide a valuable source of progenitor cells. However, whether ES cells can be stimulated by factors secreted from the fetal renal cells to differentiate into renal precursor cells in vitro has not been reported. In this study, we showed that murine ES cells can give rise to embryoid bodies in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. Culture conditions were optimized [6 days, 10 ng/ml activin and 10(-7) M retinoic acid (RA)] to generate maximal mesoderm populations specifically expressing Pax2 and brachyury. Results showed that 72% of the cells were brachyury positive by fluorescent activated cell sorter on Day 6 of EB cell differentiation. Conditioned medium collected from cultures of ureteric bud cells from renal cells of a 13-day-old fetus was added to the culture medium. Mesoderm cells were cultured for up to 10 days before showing expression of renal markers, initiation of nephrogenesis (WT-1 and Pax2), and terminally differentiated renal cell types (POD-1 and E-cadherin). This study suggests that ES cells pre-treated by RA and activin can interact with secreted molecules of the fetal renal cells to specifically differentiate into renal precursor cells. Our results provide an experimental basis for the development of in vitro assays to steer differentiation of ES cells toward renal lineages.</str>

      <str>The switch of tumor cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal-like phenotype [designated as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)] is known to induce tumor cell motility and invasiveness, therefore promoting metastasis of solid carcinomas. Although multiple studies have focused on elucidating the signaling events that initiate this phenotypic switch, there has been so far no characterization of the pattern of soluble mediators released by tumor cells undergoing EMT, and the potential impact that this phenotypic switch could have on the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Here we show that induction of EMT in human carcinoma cells via overexpression of the transcription factor Brachyury is associated with enhanced secretion of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors and, in particular, with the induction of the IL-8/IL-8R axis. Our results also indicate the essential role of interleukin 8 (IL-8) signaling for the acquisition and/or maintenance of the mesenchymal and invasive features of Brachyury-overexpressing tumor cells and show that IL-8 secreted by tumor cells undergoing EMT could potentiate tumor progression by inducing adjacent epithelial tumor cells into EMT. Altogether, our results emphasize the potential role of EMT in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment via secretion of multiple soluble mediators and suggest that IL-8 signaling blockade may provide a means of targeting mesenchymal-like, invasive tumor cells.</str>

      <str>In the present study, we addressed the role of (beta)-catenin in the specification of embryonic cells of the ascidians Ciona intestinalis and C. savignyi and obtained the following results: (1) During cleavages, (beta)-catenin accumulated in the nuclei of vegetal blastomeres, suggesting that it plays a role in the specification of endoderm. (2) Mis- and/or overexpression of (beta)-catenin induced the development of an endoderm-specific alkaline phosphatase (AP) in presumptive notochord cells and epidermis cells without affecting differentiation of primary lineage muscle cells. (3) Downregulation of (beta)-catenin induced by the overexpression of cadherin resulted in the suppression of endoderm cell differentiation. This suppression was compensated for by the differentiation of extra epidermis cells. (4) Specification of notochord cells did not take place in the absence of endoderm differentiation. Both the overexpression of (beta)-catenin in presumptive notochord cells and the downregulation of (beta)-catenin in presumptive endoderm cells led to the suppression of Brachyury gene expression, resulting in the failure of notochord specification. These results suggest that the accumulation of (beta)-catenin in the nuclei of endoderm progenitor cells is the first step in the process of ascidian endoderm specification.</str>

      <str>Inhibition of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling prevents trunk and tail formation in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos. While the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (called No Tail in zebrafish) is a key mediator of FGF signaling in the notochord and tail, the pathways activated by FGF in non-notochordal trunk mesoderm have been uncertain. Previous studies have shown that the spadetail gene is required for non-notochordal trunk mesoderm formation; spadetail mutant embryos have major trunk mesoderm deficiencies, but relatively normal tail and notochord development. We demonstrate here that spadetail encodes a T-box transcription factor with homologues in Xenopus and chick. Spadetail is likely to be a key mediator of FGF signaling in trunk non-notochordal mesoderm, since spadetail expression is regulated by FGF signaling. Trunk and tail development are therefore dependent upon the complementary actions of two T-box genes, spadetail and no tail. We show that the regulatory hierarchy among spadetail, no tail and a third T-box gene, tbx6, are substantially different during trunk and tail mesoderm formation, and propose a genetic model that accounts for the regional phenotypes of spadetail and no tail mutants.</str>

      <str>Our ability to guide differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) toward desired lineages efficiently and reproducibly in xeno-free conditions is the key to advancing hPSC technology from the laboratory to clinical use. Here we report an engineered biomimetic substrate functionalized with both peptide ligands for α5β1 and α6β1 integrins to support efficient early mesodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) when cultured in a differentiation medium containing BMP4. In contrast, mesodermal differentiation is not induced on substrates functionalized with either ligand alone even though the culture medium is identical. Mesodermal differentiation was characterized by immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometric analysis, and RT-PCR analysis of early mesodermal markers Brachyury, Mixl1, and Wnt3. The early mesodermal progenitors derived on the substrate functionalized with both integrin ligands have the normal developmental potential to further differentiate along the hemato-endothelial and cardiac lineages. Immobilized ligands for α5β1 and α6β1 integrins both are permissive, necessary, and sufficient insoluble ligands in this engineered system to support early mesodermal differentiation of hESCs. This synthetic substrate, in conjunction with defined soluble factors, constructs a well-controlled and xeno-free early mesodermal differentiation niche that offers advantages over the previously reported niche constructed with the Matrigel-coated substrate.</str>

      <str>Neural induction is widely believed to be a direct consequence of inhibition of BMP pathways. Because of conflicting results and interpretations, we have re-examined this issue in Xenopus and chick embryos using the powerful and general TGFbeta inhibitor, Smad7, which inhibits both Smad1- (BMP) and Smad2- (Nodal/Activin) mediated pathways. We confirm that Smad7 efficiently inhibits phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad2. Surprisingly, however, over-expression of Smad7 in Xenopus ventral epidermis induces expression of the dorsal mesodermal markers Chordin and Brachyury. Neural markers are induced, but in a non-cell-autonomous manner and only when Chordin and Brachyury are also induced. Simultaneous inhibition of Smad1 and Smad2 by different approaches does not account for all Smad7 effects, indicating that Smad7 has activities other than inhibition of the TGFbeta pathway. We provide evidence that these effects are independent of Wnt, FGF, Hedgehog and retinoid signalling. We also show that these effects are due to elements outside of the MH2 domain of Smad7. Together, these results indicate that BMP inhibition is not sufficient for neural induction even when Nodal/Activin is also blocked, and that Smad7 activity is considerably more complex than had previously been assumed. We suggest that experiments relying on Smad7 as an inhibitor of TGFbeta-pathways should be interpreted with considerable caution.</str>

      <str>Mechanisms that regulate the number of cells constituting the body have remained largely elusive. We approached this issue in the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, which develops into a tadpole larva with a small number of cells. The embryonic cells divide 11 times on average from fertilization to hatching. The number of cell division rounds varies among tissue types. For example, notochord cells divide 9 times and give rise to large postmitotic cells in the tadpole. The number of cell division rounds in partial embryos derived from tissue-precursor blastomeres isolated at the 64-cell stage also varied between tissues and coincided with their counterparts in the intact whole embryos to some extent, suggesting tissue-autonomous regulation of cell division. Manipulation of cell fates in notochord, nerve cord, muscle, and mesenchyme lineage cells by inhibition or ectopic activation of the inductive FGF signal changed the number of cell divisions according to the altered fate. Knockdown and missexpression of Brachyury (Bra), an FGF-induced notochord-specific key transcription factor for notochord differentiation, indicated that Bra is also responsible for regulation of the number of cell division rounds, suggesting that Bra activates a putative mechanism to halt cell division at a specific stage. The outcome of precocious expression of Bra suggests that the mechanism involves a putative developmental clock that is likely shared in blastomeres other than those of notochord and functions to terminate cell division at three rounds after the 64-cell stage. Precocious expression of Bra has no effect on progression of the developmental clock itself.</str>

The self-renewal of pluripotent mouse ES cells has been shown to require extrinsic stimulation by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathways and the expression of the transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. However, the network of interactions among extrinsic and intrinsic determinants of ES cell pluripotency is currently poorly understood. Here, we show that Nanog expression is up-regulated in mouse ES cells by the binding of T (Brachyury) and STAT3 to an enhancer element in the mouse Nanog gene. We further show that Nanog blocks BMP-induced mesoderm differentiation of ES cells by physically interacting with Smad1 and interfering with the recruitment of coactivators to the active Smad transcriptional complexes. Taken together, our findings illustrate the existence of ES cell-specific regulatory networks that underlie the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency and provide mechanistic insights into the role of Nanog in this process.</str>

      <str>The study of axis extension and somitogenesis has been greatly advanced through the use of genetic tools such as the TCre mouse line. In this line, Cre is controlled by a fragment of the T (Brachyury) promoter that is active in progenitor cells that reside within the primitive streak and tail bud and which give rise to lineages emerging from these tissues as the embryonic axis extends. However, because TCre-mediated recombination occurs early in development, gene inactivation can result in an axis truncation that precludes the study of gene function in later or more posterior tissues. To address this limitation, we have generated an inducible TCre transgenic mouse line, called TCreERT2, that provides temporal control, through tamoxifen administration, in all cells emerging from the primitive streak or tail bud throughout development. TCreERT2 activity is mostly silent in the absence of tamoxifen and, in its presence, results in near complete recombination of emerging mesoderm from E7.5 through E13.5. We demonstrate the utility of the TCreERT2 line for determining rate of posterior axis extension and somite formation, thus providing the first in vivo tool for such measurements. To test the usefulness of TCreERT2 for genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that an early deletion of ß-Catenin via TCreERT2 induction phenocopies the TCre-mediated deletion of ß-Catenin defect, whereas a later induction bypasses this early phenotype and produces a similar defect in more caudal tissues. TCreERT2 provides a useful and novel tool for the control of gene expression of emerging embryonic lineages throughout development.</str>

      <str>Mammalian development requires commitment of cells to restricted lineages, which requires epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. Epigenetic modifications were examined during in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. Global histone acetylation, a euchromatin marker, declines dramatically within 1 day of differentiation induction and partially rebounds by day 2. Histone H3-Lys9 methylation, a heterochromatin marker, increases during in vitro differentiation. Conversely, the euchromatin marker H3-Lys4 methylation transiently decreases, then increases to undifferentiated levels by day 4, and decreases by day 6. Global cytosine methylation, another heterochromatin marker, increases slightly during ES cell differentiation. Chromatin structure of the Oct4 and Brachyury gene promoters is modulated in concert with their pattern of expression during ES cell differentiation. Importantly, prevention of global histone deacetylation by treatment with trichostatin A prevents ES cell differentiation. Hence, ES cells undergo functionally important global and gene-specific remodeling of chromatin structure during in vitro differentiation. genesis 38:32-38, 2004.</str>

      <str>Retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A, plays a pivotal role in vertebrate development. The level of RA may be determined by the balance between its synthesis and degradation. We have examined the role of CYP26, a P450 enzyme that may degrade RA, by generating mutant mice that lack CYP26. CYP26(-/-) mice exhibited anomalies, including caudal agenesis, similar to those induced by administration of excess RA. The concentration of endogenous RA, as revealed by marker gene activity, was markedly increased in the tailbud of the mutant animals, in which CYP26 is normally expressed. Expression of T (Brachyury) and Wnt3a in the tailbud was down-regulated in CYP26(-/-) mice, which may underlie the caudal truncation. The lack of CYP26 also resulted in homeotic transformation of vertebrae as well as in misspecification of the rostral hindbrain associated with anterior expansion of RA-positive domains. These results suggest that local degradation of RA by CYP26 is required for establishing an uneven distribution of RA along the anterio-posterior axis, which is essential for patterning the hindbrain, vertebrae, and tailbud.</str>

      <str>The establishment of the primitive streak and its derivative germ layers, mesoderm and endoderm, are prerequisite steps in the formation of many tissues. To model these developmental stages in vitro, an ES cell line was established that expresses CD4 from the foxa2 locus in addition to GFP from the brachyury locus. A GFP-Bry(+) population expressing variable levels of CD4-Foxa2 developed upon differentiation of this ES cell line. Analysis of gene-expression patterns and developmental potential revealed that the CD4-Foxa2(hi)GFP-Bry(+) population displays characteristics of the anterior primitive streak, whereas the CD4-Foxa2(lo)GFP-Bry(+) cells resemble the posterior streak. Using this model, we were able to demonstrate that Wnt and TGF-beta/nodal/activin signaling simultaneously were required for the generation of the CD4-Foxa2(+)GFP-Bry(+) population. Wnt or low levels of activin-induced a posterior primitive streak population, whereas high levels of activin resulted in an anterior streak fate. Finally, sustained activin signaling was found to stimulate endoderm commitment from the CD4-Foxa2(+)GFP-Bry(+) ES cell population. These findings demonstrate that the early developmental events involved in germ-layer induction in the embryo are recapitulated in the ES cell model and uncover insights into the signaling pathways involved in the establishment of mesoderm and endoderm.</str>

      <str>In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of an early embryoid body-derived colony, termed the transitional colony, which contains cell populations undergoing the commitment of mesoderm to the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Analysis of individual transitional colonies indicated that they express Brachyury as well as flk-1, SCL/tal-1, GATA-1, (beta)H1 and (beta)major reflecting the combination of mesodermal, hematopoietic and endothelial populations. This pattern differs from that found in the previously described hemangioblast-derived blast cell colonies in that they typically lacked Brachyury expression, consistent with their post-mesodermal stage of development (Kennedy, M., Firpo, M., Choi, K., Wall, C., Robertson, S., Kabrun, N. and Keller, G. (1997) Nature 386, 488-493). Replating studies demonstrated that transitional colonies contain low numbers of primitive erythroid precursors as well as a subset of precursors associated with early stage definitive hematopoiesis. Blast cell colonies contain higher numbers and a broader spectrum of definitive precursors than found in the transitional colonies. ES cells homozygous null for the SCL/tal-1 gene, a transcription factor known to be essential for development of the primitive and definitive hematopoietic systems, were not able to form blast colonies but did form transitional colonies. Together these findings suggest that the transitional colony represents a stage of development earlier than the blast cell colony and one that uniquely defines the requirement for a functional SCL/tal-1 gene for the progression to hematopoietic commitment.</str>

      <str>The chick, Gallus gallus, is the traditional model in avian developmental studies. Data on other bird species are scarce. Here, we present a comparative study of the embryonic development of the chick and the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae, a member of Paleognathae, which also includes the ostrich, rhea, tinamou, kiwi, and cassowary. Emu embryos ranging from Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) equivalent stages 1 to 43 were collected and their gross morphology analyzed. Its early development was studied in detail with time-lapse imaging and molecular techniques. Emu embryos in general take 2-3 times longer incubation time to reach equivalent chicken stages, requiring 1 day for HH2, 2.5 days for HH4, 7 days for limb bud initiation, 23 days for feather germ appearance, and approximately 50-56 days for hatching. Chordin gene expression is similar in emu and chick embryos, and emu Brachyury is not expressed until HH3. Circulation is established at approximately the 27- to 30-somite stage. Forelimb buds are formed and patterned initially, but their growth is severely retarded. The size difference between an emu and a chick embryo only becomes apparent after limb bud formation. Overall, emu and chick embryogenesis proceeds through similar stages, but developmental heterochrony between these two species is widely observed.</str>

      <str>An important question in developmental biology is how the number of cells constituting the body is regulated during development. After termination of cell divisions, cells enter the postmitotic phase, but the mechanisms determining the timing of final cell division remain unclear. In ascidians, the egg develops into a tadpole larva consisting of a relatively small number of cells (approximately 2800), indicating that embryonic cells divide 11.5 times on average after fertilization, although the number of cell division rounds differs among tissues. This article discusses the possible mechanisms that control the timing of the final cell division: these include (i) the analog and digital clock models, in which the elapsed time and number of cell division cycles are measured after fertilization, respectively, and (ii) the analog and digital timer models, in which the elapsed time and number of cell divisions are measured after cell fate specification, respectively. In notochord and muscle cells of ascidian embryos, cell division termination involves cell fate specification by inductive FGF signaling, followed by activation of the tissue-specific key transcription factors, Brachyury and Tbx6, which then induce gene expression of an effector, Cdk inhibitor. The present evidence suggests that these timing mechanisms comprise two functional phases: (i) an analog timer, which is mediated by accumulation of Cdk inhibitor protein after cell fate specification, and (ii) a timekeeper, which confines the timing, when the above timer is triggered by Brachyury and Tbx6, to the appropriate stage. </str>

      <str>Brachyury plays a pivotal role in the notochord formation in ascidian embryos. Ciona intestinalis Noto4 (Ci-Noto4) was isolated as a gene downstream of Ci-Bra. This gene encodes a 307 amino-acid protein with a C-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PTB/PID). Expression of Ci-Noto4 commences at the neural plate stage and is specific to notochord cells. Suppression of Ci-Noto4 levels with specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in the formation of two rows of notochord cells owing to a lack of midline intercalation between the bilateral populations of progenitor cells. In contrast, overexpression of Ci-Noto4 by injection of a Ci-Bra(promoter):Ci-Noto4-EGFP construct into fertilized eggs disrupted the localization of notochord cells. Ci-Noto4 overexpression did not affect cellular differentiation in the notochord, muscle, mesenchyme, or nervous system. Analysis of Ci-Noto4 regions that are responsible for its function suggested significant roles for the PTB/PID and a central region, an area with no obvious sequence similarity to other known proteins. These results suggested that PTB/PID-containing Ci-Noto4 is essential for midline intercalation of notochord cells in chordate embryos.</str>

      <str>It has been known for several years that the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have potent mesoderm-inducing activity. As a result they have been considered good candidates for one of the endogenous vegetally localized mesoderm-inducing signals in the amphibian Xenopus laevis. In this review the properties of the FGFs and their expression patterns in Xenopus are described. Recent work is discussed which reveals a close link between FGF signalling and regulation of the Xenopus brachyury (Xbra) gene. These data are used to build a model of FGF function which is quite different from what was originally conceived. Present evidence supports the view that during blastula stages the FGFs do not act as vegetally localized inducing signals. Instead, they are required in the animal hemisphere as competence factors, which provide a low level stimulation of the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway. FGF activity is necessary for the full range of responses to the vegetal inducing signals, including the activation of Xbra transcription in the marginal zone of the late blastula. Xbra is able to activate the zygotic transcription of eFGF, which suggests that there is a period of autocatalytic activation of eFGF and Xbra transcription within the forming mesoderm of the marginal zone. FGF activity continues to be required to maintain the expression of a sub-set of mesodermal genes, including Xbra, in the blastopore region and possibly also in the notochord through gastrula and neurula stages. In addition a role for the FGFs in anteroposterior specification and development of the myogenic lineages is discussed.</str>

      <str>A common feature of development in most vertebrate models is the early segregation of the germ line from the soma. For example, in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified by germ plasm that is inherited from the egg; in mice, Blimp1 expression in the epiblast mediates the commitment of cells to the germ line. How these disparate mechanisms of PGC specification evolved is unknown. Here, in order to identify the ancestral mechanism of PGC specification in vertebrates, we studied PGC specification in embryos from the axolotl (Mexican salamander), a model for the tetrapod ancestor. In the axolotl, PGCs develop within mesoderm, and classic studies have reported their induction from primitive ectoderm (animal cap). We used an axolotl animal cap system to demonstrate that signalling through FGF and BMP4 induces PGCs. The role of FGF was then confirmed in vivo. We also showed PGC induction by Brachyury, in the presence of BMP4. These conditions induced pluripotent mesodermal precursors that give rise to a variety of somatic cell types, in addition to PGCs. Irreversible restriction of the germ line did not occur until the mid-tailbud stage, days after the somatic germ layers are established. Before this, germline potential was maintained by MAP kinase signalling. We propose that this stochastic mechanism of PGC specification, from mesodermal precursors, is conserved in vertebrates.</str>

      <str>The cellular and molecular events underlying the formation and differentiation of mesoderm to derivatives such as blood are critical to our understanding of the development and function of many tissues and organ systems. How different mesodermal populations are set aside to form specific lineages is not well understood. Although previous genetic studies in the mouse embryo have pointed to a critical role for the homeobox gene Mix-like (mMix) in gastrulation, its function in mesoderm development remains unclear. Hematopoietic defects have been identified in differentiating embryonic stem cells in which mMix was genetically inactivated. Here we show that conditional induction of mMix in embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies results in the early activation of mesodermal markers prior to expression of Brachyury/T and acceleration of the mesodermal developmental program. Strikingly, increased numbers of mesodermal, hemangioblastic, and hematopoietic progenitors form in response to premature activation of mMix. Differentiation to primitive (embryonic) and definitive (adult type) blood cells proceeds normally and without an apparent bias in the representation of different hematopoietic cell fates. Therefore, the mouse Mix gene functions early in the recruitment and/or expansion of mesodermal progenitors to the hemangioblastic and hematopoietic lineages.</str>

      <str>Chordomas of the skull base are generally regarded as slow-growing tumors; however, approximately 20% of these lesions have been shown to recur as early as 1 year postsurgery. The classic pathological paradigms are poor predictors of outcome, and additional markers are needed to identify patients at risk for early tumor recurrence. In this study the authors describe such a marker.</str>
      <str>In a series of 26 patients with chordomas of the skull base, the authors investigated the relationship between the biological behavior of the tumor, which was determined according to the interval for its recurrence and volume doubling time, and several pathological and molecular features, which included the histological variant, proliferative activity, mutation of p53 protein, expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) messenger (m)RNA, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and microsatellite instability. The major finding in this study was that hTERT mRNA expression in chordoma cells identifies those tumors that exhibit unusually fast rates of growth. The expression of hTERT mRNA was frequently associated with mutation of p53 protein, indicating that telomerase dysfunction combines with abnormal p53 function to initiate the unrestrained clonal expansion of the tumor cells. In cases in which the tumor was partially removed, mutation of p53 protein and expression of hTERT mRNA predicted increased doubling time for residual tumor as well as the probability of tumor recurrence. Cell proliferation, as investigated using the Ki-67 method, was significantly related to the tumor doubling time; however, the authors found that the pattern of cell proliferation was not homogeneous throughout the chordoma tissue, and that the proliferative index might change by a factor as high as 8 among different regions of the same tumor. The LOH and microsatellite instability do not seem to affect the prognosis of skull base chordomas.</str>

      <str>Early porcine conceptus development is characterized by rapid trophoblastic elongation between Days 11 and 12 of pregnancy, a period of embryonic loss in the pig. Growth factors and steroids secreted by the conceptus and uterus, as well as ligand receptors produced by the conceptus, are thought to regulate trophoblastic elongation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize conceptus gene expression for the steroidogenic enzymes 17alpha-hydroxylase and aromatase and the mesodermal marker brachyury, as well as the expression of receptors for fibronectin (integrin beta-1), progesterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prostaglandin F2alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), prior to and during trophoblastic elongation. Total RNA was extracted from individual conceptuses from Day 10 to Day 12 of pregnancy. Gene expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on conceptuses having 2- to 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10- to 12-mm spherical, 13- to 25-mm tubular, and &gt; 100-mm filamentous morphologies. There was a stage of development effect on both 17alpha-hydroxylase (p &lt; 0.001) and aromatase (p &lt; 0.003) gene expression. Initial 17alpha-hydroxylase gene expression was detected in early spherical conceptuses (2-4 mm), increasing abruptly through to 7-mm conceptuses. Aromatase gene expression increased dramatically in 6- to 7-mm conceptuses, with increased expression throughout development. Gene expression for LIF receptor (LIFR) (p &lt; 0.02) was similar to that for 17alpha-hydroxylase, while brachyury gene expression began in 6-mm conceptuses and increased (p &lt; 0.001) throughout development. Integrin beta-1 was expressed at all stages of development. Conceptus gene expression was not detected for progesterone, estrogen, oxytocin, and prostaglandin F2alpha receptors. Prior to elongation, dynamic changes in gene expression are occurring that appear to be associated with estrogen production and preparation of the conceptuses for elongation. LIFR expression is highly associated with steroidogenic enzyme production with an initial peak preceding rapid trophoblastic elongation, suggesting that LIF may be involved in early conceptus development in the pig.</str>

Using immunohistochemical techniques, the cellular localization and expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was assessed, whereas its activity was determined by fibrin zymography, and the amounts of enzyme were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in primary spinal column tumors (chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and giant cell tumor) and metastatic tumors of the spine arising from various malignancies (breast, lung, thyroid, and renal cell carcinomas, and melanomas). Metastatic tumors displayed higher levels of uPA activity than did primary spinal tumors (P&lt;0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that uPA expression was highest in metastases from lung and breast carcinomas and melanomas, followed by metastatic tumors from thyroid and renal cell carcinomas. Similar results were obtained for uPA activity and enzyme level as determined by fibrin zymography and ELISA, respectively. We conclude that metastatic spinal tumors possess higher levels of uPA expression and activity than the primary spinal tumors, which tend to be less aggressive and only locally invasive malignancies.

      <str>I isolated a Ciona intestinalis homolog of p53, Ci-p53/p73-a, in a microarray screen of rapidly degraded maternal mRNA by comparing the transcriptomes of unfertilized eggs and 32-cell stage embryos. Higher expression of the gene in eggs and lower expression in later embryonic stages were confirmed by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR); expression was ubiquitous in eggs and early embryos. Knockdown of Ci-p53/p73-a by injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) severely perturbed gastrulation cell movements and expression of notochord marker genes. A key regulator of notochord differentiation in Ciona embryos is Brachyury (Ci-Bra), which is directly activated by a zic-like gene (Ci-ZicL). The expression of Ci-ZicL and Ci-Bra in A-line notochord precursors was downregulated in Ci-p53/p73-a knockdown embryos. Maternal expression of Ci-p53/p73-b, a homolog of Ci-p53/p73-a, was also detected. In Ci-p53/p73-b knockdown embryos, gastrulation cell movements, expression of Ci-ZicL and Ci-Bra in A-line notochord precursors, and expression of notochord marker gene at later stages were perturbed. The upstream region of Ci-ZicL contains putative p53-binding sites. Cis-regulatory analysis of Ci-ZicL showed that these sites are involved in expression of Ci-ZicL in A-line notochord precursors at the 32-cell and early gastrula stages. These results suggest that p53 genes are maternal factors that play a crucial role in A-line notochord differentiation in C. intestinalis embryos by regulating Ci-ZicL expression.</str>

      <str>The brain, heart and gastro-intestinal tract develop distinct left-right (LR) asymmetries. Asymmetric cilia-dependent fluid flow in the embryonic node in mouse, Kupffer's vesicle in zebrafish, notochordal plate in rabbit and gastrocoel roof plate in frog appears to be a conserved mechanism that directs LR asymmetric gene expression and establishes the orientation of organ asymmetry. However, the cellular processes and genetic pathways that control the formation of these essential ciliated structures are unknown. In zebrafish, migratory dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) give rise to Kupffer's vesicle (KV), a ciliated epithelial sheet that forms a lumen and generates fluid flow. Using the epithelial marker atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) and other markers to analyze DFCs and KV cells, we describe a multi-step process by which DFCs form a functional KV. Using mutants and morpholinos, we show that two T-box transcription factors-No tail (Ntl)/Brachyury and Tbx16/Spadetail-cooperatively regulate an early step of DFC mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) and KV cell specification. Subsequently, each transcription factor independently controls a distinct step in KV formation: Tbx16 regulates apical clustering of KV cells and Ntl is necessary for KV lumen formation. By targeting morpholinos to DFCs, we show that these cell autonomous functions in KV morphogenesis are necessary for LR patterning throughout the embryo.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells are pluripotent and have the capacity to differentiate into many cell types. The ability to direct their differentiation should have considerable practical applications. Here, we first report the use of diced short interfering RNAi against Oct4 in a transient approach, to direct differentiation of ES towards the trophectoderm lineage. We then apply this approach to downregulate Smad4 in mouse P19 EC cells. We have found that this leads to an increase in the levels of Pax6 (a neuroectoderm marker), reduction in the levels of Brachyury (a mesoderm marker), and a 3-fold increase in the number of betaIII tubulin-positive colonies when these cells were allowed to differentiate. This indicates a redirection of cell fate towards the neuroectoderm lineage. Thus, transient RNAi could provide a valuable tool to direct pluripotent cells along specific pathways of differentiation while circumventing permanent genetic changes.</str>

      <str>Pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells are tissue-committed cells, which can differentiate into all kinds of pancreatic cells. They are potential candidates for regeneration of pancreatic tissue. However, it is unfeasible to acquire PP cells from pancreatic tissues and expand them in vitro. Generation of PP cells from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) would provide an unlimited source of PP cells. Here we developed a 2-step stepwise protocol, which induced AD-MSCs to generate FOXA2- or SOX17-positive definitive endoderm (DE) (5 days) and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (PDX1)-positive PP cells (4-6 days). By mimicking the developmental progress in embryonic development, we optimized the timing and combination of cytokines to activate the key signaling pathways during pancreatic development. We found that activating the Nodal/Activin signal with Activin A could induce differentiation of AD-MSCs toward DE, which could be further promoted by the Wnt signaling pathway activator Wnt3a. Besides, transient T (BRACHYURY)(+) mesendodermal cells were observed during formation of DE from AD-MSCs. Subsequently, the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dkk1 along with retinoic acid/FGF2 (60 ng/mL) further induced AD-MSC-derived DE cells to differentiate into PDX1-positive PP cells. The derived PP cells were capable to form pancreatic endocrine or exocrine cells. In conclusion, we established a stepwise protocol that could derive DE and PP cells from AD-MSCs. It might provide an unlimited source of autologous PP cells for pancreatic diseases.</str>

While conditional gene silencing is possible in other genetic model organisms, this technology is largely unavailable in zebrafish, an important vertebrate model organism for functional gene discovery. Here, using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed in the microRNA-30 backbone, which have been shown to mimic natural microRNA primary transcripts and be more effective than simple shRNAs, we report stable RNA interference-mediated gene silencing in zebrafish employing the yeast Gal4-UAS system. Using this approach, we reveal at single-cell resolution the role of atypical protein kinase Cλ (aPKCλ) in regulating neural progenitor/stem cell division. We also show effective silencing of the one-eyed-pinhead and no-tail/brachyury genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate stable integration and germ-line transmission of the UAS-miR-shRNAs for aPKCλ, the expressivity of which is controllable by the strength and expression of Gal4. This technology shall significantly advance the utility of zebrafish for understanding fundamental vertebrate biology and for the identification and evaluation of important therapeutic targets.</str>

      <str>Hemangioblastomas are central nervous system (CNS) tumors of unknown histogenesis, which can occur sporadically or in von Hippel-Lindau disease. Hemangioblastomas are composed of neoplastic "stromal" cells of unknown origin, accompanied by intensive reactive angiogenesis. Failure to specify the cytologic origin of the stromal cell has precluded the development of nonsurgical therapies and limits understanding of its basic biology. We report that the stromal cells express proteins (Scl, brachyury, Csf-1R, Gata-1, Flk-1, and Tie-2) that characterize embryonic progenitor cells with hemangioblastic differentiation potential and conclude that embryonic progenitors with hemangioblast potential represent a possible cytologic equivalent of the stromal cell. We also identified a new autocrine/paracrine stimulatory loop between the receptor Tie-2 and the hypoxia-inducible factor target Ang-1, which, combined with previous observations, suggests that a variety of autocrine loops may be initiated in hemangioblastomas, depending on the differentiation status of the tumor cells and the extent of HIF downstream activation. Finally, the consistent identification of Scl in the stromal cells may help explain the unique and characteristic topographical distribution of hemangioblastomas within the CNS.</str>

      <str>A novel family of transcription factors that appears to play a critical role in the development of all animal species was recently uncovered on the basis of homology of the DNA binding domain of the Brachyury, or T locus, gene product. Phylogenetic studies have shown the ancient origin of this gene family, which has been named the T-box family, prior to the divergence of metazoa from a common ancestral type. T-box genes have now been identified in the genomes of C. elegans, Drosophila, sea urchin, ascidian, amphioxus, Xenopus, chick, zebrafish, mouse, and human and will probably be found in the genomes of all animals. Although functional analyses of T-box family members have just begun, the results show a wide range of roles in developmental processes that extend over time from the unfertilized egg through organogenesis. Only a few mutations in T-box genes are known, but all have drastic effects on development, including a targeted mutation in mice causing an embryonic lethal phenotype, and two human T-box gene mutations that results in developmental syndromes. This review presents a current overview of progress made in the analysis of T-box genes and their products in a variety of model systems.</str>

      <str>The visceral musculature of the larval midgut of Drosophila has a lattice-type structure and consists of an inner stratum of circular fibers and an outer stratum of longitudinal fibers. The longitudinal fibers originate from the posterior tip of the mesoderm anlage, which has been termed the caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM). In this study, we investigate the specification of the CVM and particularly the role of the Drosophila Brachyury-homologue brachyenteron. Supported by fork head, brachyenteron mediates the early specification of the CVM along with zinc-finger homeodomain protein-1. This is the first function described for brachyenteron or fork head in the mesoderm of Drosophila. The mode of cooperation resembles the interaction of the Xenopus homologues Xbra and Pintallavis. Another function of brachyenteron is to establish the surface properties of the CVM cells, which are essential for their orderly migration along the trunk-derived visceral mesoderm. During this movement, the CVM cells, under the control of brachyenteron, induce the formation of one muscle/pericardial precursor cell in each parasegment. We propose that the functions of brachyenteron in mesodermal development of Drosophila are comparable to the roles of the vertebrate Brachyury genes during gastrulation.</str>

      <str>In vitro recapitulation of mammalian embryogenesis and examination of the emerging behaviours of embryonic structures require both the means to engineer complexity and accurately assess phenotypes of multicellular aggregates. Current approaches to study multicellular populations in 3D configurations are limited by the inability to create complex (i.e. spatially heterogeneous) environments in a reproducible manner with high fidelity thus impeding the ability to engineer microenvironments and combinations of cells with similar complexity to that found during morphogenic processes such as development, remodelling and wound healing. Here, we develop a multicellular embryoid body (EB) fusion technique as a higher-throughput in vitro tool, compared to a manual assembly, to generate developmentally relevant embryonic patterns. We describe the physical principles of the EB fusion microfluidic device design; we demonstrate that &gt;60 conjoined EBs can be generated overnight and emulate a development process analogous to mouse gastrulation during early embryogenesis. Using temporal delivery of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) to embryoid bodies, we recapitulate embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) during mouse embryo development with induced mesoderm differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells leading to expression of Brachyury-T-green fluorescent protein (T-GFP), an indicator of primitive streak development and mesoderm differentiation during gastrulation. The proposed microfluidic approach could be used to manipulate hundreds or more of individual embryonic cell aggregates in a rapid fashion, thereby allowing controlled differentiation patterns in fused multicellular assemblies to generate complex yet spatially controlled microenvironments. </str>

      <str>Heparan sulfate (HS) has been implicated in regulating cell fate decisions during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into advanced cell types. However, the necessity and the underlying molecular mechanisms of HS in early cell lineage differentiation are still largely unknown. In this study, we examined the potential of EXT1(-/-) mouse ESCs (mESCs), that are deficient in HS, to differentiate into primary germ layer cells. We observed that EXT1(-/-) mESCs lost their differentiation competence and failed to differentiate into Pax6(+)-neural precursor cells and mesodermal cells. More detailed analyses highlighted the importance of HS for the induction of Brachyury(+) pan-mesoderm as well as normal gene expression associated with the dorso-ventral patterning of mesoderm. Examination of developmental cell signaling revealed that EXT1 ablation diminished FGF and BMP but not Wnt signaling. Furthermore, restoration of FGF and BMP signaling each partially rescued mesoderm differentiation defects. We further show that BMP4 is more prone to degradation in EXT1(-/-) mESCs culture medium compared with that of wild type cells. Therefore, our data reveal that HS stabilizes BMP ligand and thereby maintains the BMP signaling output required for normal mesoderm differentiation. In summary, our study demonstrates that HS is required for ESC pluripotency, in particular lineage specification into mesoderm through facilitation of FGF and BMP signaling.</str>

      <str>During axis formation in amniotes, posterior and lateral epiblast cells in the area pellucida undergo a counter-rotating movement along the midline to form primitive streak (Polonaise movements). Using chick blastoderms, we investigated the signaling involved in this cellular movement in epithelial-epiblast. In cultured posterior blastoderm explants from stage X to XI embryos, either Lefty1 or Cerberus-S inhibited initial migration of the explants on chamber slides. In vivo analysis showed that inhibition of Nodal signaling by Lefty1 affected the movement of DiI-marked epiblast cells prior to the formation of primitive streak. In Lefty1-treated embryos without a primitive streak, Brachyury expression showed a patchy distribution. However, SU5402 did not affect the movement of DiI-marked epiblast cells. Multi-cellular rosette, which is thought to be involved in epithelial morphogenesis, was found predominantly in the posterior half of the epiblast, and Lefty1 inhibited the formation of rosettes. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed two types of rosette, one with a protruding cell, the other with a ventral hollow. Our results suggest that Nodal signaling may have a pivotal role in the morphogenetic movements of epithelial epiblast including Polonaise movements and formation of multi-cellular rosette.</str>

      <str>Differentiating mouse ES cells were treated with suramin (500 µM) from day 5 to 7 of embryoid body formation, and cells were analysed for their differentiation potential via morphological analysis, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and patch clamp analysis.</str>
      <str>Application of suramin resulted in an increased number of cardiac cells, but inhibition of neuronal, skeletal muscle and definitive endoderm differentiation. Immediately after suramin treatment, a decreased mesendoderm differentiation was found. Brachyury, FGF10, Wnt8 and Wnt3a transcript levels were significantly down-regulated, followed by a decrease in mesoderm- and cardiac progenitor-specific markers BMP2, GATA4/5, Wnt11, Isl1, Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 immediately after removal of the substance. With continued differentiation, a significant up-regulation of Brachyury, FGF10 and GATA5 transcript levels was observed, whereas Nkx2.5, Isl1, Tbx5, BMP2 and Wnt11 levels were normalized to control levels. At advanced differentiation stages, sinus node-specific HCN4, Tbx2 and Tbx3 transcript levels were significantly up-regulated. Immunofluorescence and patch-clamp analysis confirmed the increased number of sinus node-like cells, and electrophysiological analysis revealed a lower number of atrial- and ventricular-like cardiomyocytes following suramin treatment.</str>

      <str>In the sellar region most tumors of our collection (n = 1937) are pituitary adenomas, followed by craniopharyngiomas, chordomas and meningiomas. Difficulties in morphological differential diagnosis by light microscopy may occur in meningiomas, plasmacytomas, chordomas and germinomas. In these cases, immunohistological investigations and sometimes even electron microscopy are helpful in solving the problems. Meningiomas can sometimes resemble pituitary adenomas. Of diagnostic value in these cases is the expression of vimentin and S-100-protein in the meningioma cells. Plasmacytomas may also mimic pituitary adenomas. In these cases, the positive reaction with antibodies against LCA and immunoglobulins or against kappa-light-chains and lambda-light-chains leads to the diagnosis. Chordomas, too, can sometimes be hardly distinguished from pituitary adenomas. In these cases, the expression of S-100-protein, vimentin and CEA by the chordoma cells and the typical electron microscopic features of chordomas are helpful for the differential diagnosis. Germinomas may sometimes be indistinguishable from lymphocytic hypophysitis. Of diagnostic importance are here the expression of HCG and placental alkaline phosphatase by germinoma cells. In the above mentioned cases, it is also important to perform immunohistochemical examinations for pituitary hormones including alpha-subunit. All these tumors do not express these hormones.</str>

      <str>Brachyury plays a key role in mesoderm formation during vertebrate development. Absence of the gene results in loss of posterior mesoderm and failure of the notochord to differentiate, while misexpression of Brachyury in the prospective ectoderm of Xenopus results in ectopic mesoderm formation. Brachyury is therefore both necessary and sufficient for posterior mesoderm formation. Here we present a detailed cellular and molecular analysis of the consequences of inhibiting Brachyury function during Xenopus development. Our results show that Brachyury is required for the convergent extension movements of gastrulation, for mesoderm differentiation in response to FGF, and for the survival of posterior mesodermal cells in both Xenopus and mouse.</str>

      <str>We have studied the expression of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family of receptors during the DMSO-induced differentiation of P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells into mesoderm and muscle. RXR-alpha protein is weakly detectable in untreated P19 cells and in a mutant line of P19 cells (D3) that are resistant to DMSO-induced differentiation but begins to increase by day 3 and continues to rise gradually thereafter, whereas RXR-gamma protein is readily detected in P19 cells and decreases over the course of differentiation. Protein expression is uncoupled from mRNA levels, because DMSO induces a rapid, aggregation-independent, transient increase in RXR-alpha mRNA that diminishes by day 3 of differentiation. Thus, the expression of RXR-alpha protein is prevented at early times during DMSO-induced differentiation. Stable P19 cell clones that constitutively express RXR-alpha protein [P19(RXR-alpha)] are resistant to DMSO-induced differentiation associated with increased levels of oligonucleosomal-length DNA fragmentation. Loss of RXR-alpha expression after multiple passages results in a reversion to a DMSO-responsive phenotype. Id1 transcripts are present in P19 cells and are transiently decreased on day 2 of DMSO differentiation but remain elevated in DMSO-treated P19(RXR-alpha) and in P19 cells treated simultaneously with retinoic acid and DMSO. The mRNA for the mesoderm inducer protein Brachyury T was also deregulated in P19(RXR-alpha) cells and D3 cells compared with that of wild-type P19 cells. Together, these results show that expression of the RXR-alpha mRNA and protein in P19 cells is tightly regulated during the mesodermal/muscle differentiation of P19 cells, and that ectopic expression of the RXR-alpha protein prevents differentiation associated with increased cell death, prolonged expression of Brachyury T, and constitutive expression of Id1.</str>

      <str>Three cases of intracranial chordoma: 2 cases of typical chordoma and a case of chondroid chordoma, were reported and the clinico-pathological difference between these two types of chordoma was discussed. It is well known that typical chordoma is composed of physaliferous cells containing various quantities of intracytoplasmic mucin histologically, whereas chondroid chordoma as Heffelfinger reported in 1973 is composed of cellular area with scanty myxoid matrix and Chondroid matrix. Clinical course of the typical chordoma shows recurrence of the tumor within 2 years after surgical removal and radiation therapy in the majority of the cases, and the average survival range is said to be about 4.1 years, while chondroid chordoma takes benign course with average survival of 24.1 years after surgery and radiation therapy. One of our two patients with typical chordoma died from the recurrence two years after surgery and radiation therapy. However, the patients with chondroid chordoma showed no sign of recurrence over 2 years after subtotal removal and radiation. Surgical approach for the removal of the tumor was discussed as well. When the tumor is rather small and located at the upper clival region, transsphenoidal approach may be preferable, otherwise other approach should be chosen. When tumor has forward extension over the clivus, subtemporal approach will be most favorable with wider operative field. Identification of vessels and nerves around the tumor will be readily obtained by this approach.</str>

      <str>Much discussion about benign notochordal cell tissue in vertebrae has centered on the nature of its relationship, if any, to chordoma. Often referred to as benign notochordal cell tumors (BNCTs), these lesions have unique morphological features, however, differentiating between notochordal cells in discs, BNCT, and chordoma can be difficult. They are described as radiologically distinct from chordoma, with lysis, contrast enhancement, and a soft tissue mass indicating chordoma.</str>
      <str>All chordomas diagnosed at our institution, the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli (Bologna, Italy), prior to 2008 were reviewed, yielding 174 cases. Five were limited to bone; one was a recurrent chordoma without original data available. The remaining four were re-evaluated in detail.</str>
      <str>There were three women and one man, aged 33-57 years (mean, 48 years). Two were BNCTs and two were mixed lesions containing BNCT and chordoma. On computed tomography, all were radiopaque with areas of lysis. One BNCT was heterogeneous on magnetic resonance imaging, enhancing after contrast. Microscopically, one BNCT had a well-defined cystic area with a sclerotic border. The other had a minute atypical area; it recurred as chordoma. The mixed lesions had areas of definitive BNCT, definitive chordoma, and atypical areas that did not meet the criteria for either. The atypical areas in all three cases 'blended' with areas of chordoma or BNCT.</str>
      <str>These cases illustrate the ongoing challenges in differentiating between BNCT and chordoma. All had unique imaging features; three had atypical microscopic areas blending with BNCT or chordoma, strengthening the argument for a relationship between the two entities and supporting the idea that some BNCTs may progress to chordoma. Our study dispels the notion that any single radiologic criterion used to distinguish between chordoma and BNCT is reliable, opening the discussion as to whether or how to monitor BNCTs.</str>

      <str>"Chondroid chordoma" is a controversial and confusing entity that was originally described by Heffelfinger and colleagues as a biphasic malignant neoplasm possessing elements of both chordoma and cartilaginous tissue. Because the premise for this distinction was based strictly on histomorphologic criteria, the light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features of the chondroid and chordoid areas of five chondroid chordomas of the skull base were evaluated separately, and compared to five typical chordomas and six low grade chondrosarcomas. Using light microscopy, chondroid chordoma revealed areas that resembled typical chordoma (chordoid areas) and areas that resembled low grade chondrosarcoma (chondroid areas). However, both the chordoid and chondroid areas had an epithelial phenotype and stained strongly for cytokeratin and EMA as well as S-100. 5'-nucleotidase, an enzyme that has been described in chordoma but not in chondrosarcoma, was found in both the chordoid and chondroid areas of one chondroid chordoma. Electron microscopic studies of both the chordoid and chondroid areas in four of the tumors demonstrated both tonofibrils and desmosomes. Chordoma demonstrated immunohistochemical and electron microscopic features that were nearly identical to chondroid chordoma. Chordoma was cytokeratin, EMA, S-100, and 5'-nucleotidase positive. Ultrastructurally, chordoma exhibited variably-sized vacuoles, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and desmosomes with tonofilaments. In contrast to chondroid chordoma, chondrosarcoma consistently stained for only S-100 protein and was cytokeratin, EMA and 5'-nucleotidase negative. Ultrastructurally, chondrosarcoma demonstrated a flocculogranular matrix, glycogen, abundant RER, and scalloped cellular outlines, but lacked desmosomes with tonofilaments. These findings indicate that "chondroid chordoma" is a variant of chordoma with histologic features that may mimic chondrosarcoma. Despite the resemblance of these hyalinized areas to cartilaginous tissue, these tumors retain their epithelial phenotype. Biphasic differentiation is not present. These findings undermine the original premise for distinguishing "chondroid chordoma" from typical chordoma. The authors propose that these tumors be classified as "hyalinized chordomas," rather than "chondroid chordoma," to clarify their histogenesis and avoid confusion with chondrosarcomas of the base of the skull.</str>

      <str>Exogenous application of BMP to the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) of chick embryos at the early somite stage had a positive effect on Nodal expression. BMP applications into the right LPM were followed by a rapid activation of Nodal, while applications into the left LPM resulted in expansion of the normal domain of Nodal expression. Conversely, blocking of BMP signaling by Noggin in the left LPM interfered with the activation of Nodal expression. These results support a positive role for endogenous BMP on Nodal expression in the LPM. We also report that BMP positively regulates the expression of Caronte, Snail and Cfc in both the left and right LPM. BMP-treated embryos had molecular impairment of the midline with downregulation of Lefty1, Brachyury and Shh but we also show that the midline defect was not sufficient to induce ectopic Nodal expression.

The purpose of this study was to assess expressions of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 in skull base chordomas and to find out their correlations to outcome. Immunohistochemical study was performed in 19 samples (initial, n = 11; recurrent, n = 8) from 11 patients. The correlations among expression of RECK, MMP-2, MMP-9, and their prognostic values were analyzed. Significant correlation between RECK and MMP-9 was found, but there was no correlation found between MMP-2 and MMP-9. Higher MMP-9 expression significantly influenced outcome. Furthermore, MMP-9/RECK ratio showed significant correlation to outcome, showing their inverse relationship in the disease progress of skull base chordoma.

Despite the number of patients with IVD degeneration, gene expression analysis has not been undertaken in NP and therefore little is known about the molecular markers expressed in NP. Here, we undertook a microarray screen in NP with the other nine tissues to identify the specific cell surface markers for NP. Five membrane associating molecules out of 10,490 genes were identified as highly expressing genes in NP compared with the other tissues. Among them, we identified CD24, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor protein as a cell surface marker for NP. CD24 expression was also detected in the herniated NP and chordoma, a malignant primary tumor derived from notochordal cells, while it was absent in chondrosarcoma. Therefore, CD24 is a molecular marker for NP as well as the diseases of IVD.</str>

      <str>Differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells transiently express an endogenous activity capable of inducing Pax-3 expression in adjacent P19 stem cells (Pruitt, Development 116, 573-583, 1992). In the present study, expression of this activity in mesodermal cell lineages is demonstrated. First, expression of the mesodermal marker Brachyury correlates with expression of Pax-3-inducing activity. Second, the ability of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to block mesoderm differentiation at two different points is demonstrated and correlated with the inhibition of Pax-3-inducing activity. Finally, two mesodermal cell lines that express Pax-3-inducing activity were derived from P19 EC cells. Each of these lines expresses high levels of the mesodermal marker Brachyury and high levels of Oct-3/4 (which is down-regulated at early times during mesoderm differentiation) suggesting that these lines are early mesodermal derivatives. Unlike EC or embryonic stem cell lines, each of the two mesodermal derivatives autoinduces Hox gene expression on aggregation even in the presence of LIF. Following aggregation, anterior-specific genes are expressed more rapidly than more posterior genes. These observations directly demonstrate the ability of murine mesodermal derivatives to autoinduce Hox gene expression in the absence of signals from other cell lineages. Similar to the Pax-3-inducing activity, signals from mesodermal cell lines were sufficient to induce HOX expression in adjacent P19 stem cells in cell mixing assays. These observations are consistent with the previous suggestion (Blum, M., Gaunt, S. J., Cho, K. W. Y., Steinbeisser, H., Blumberg, B., Bittner, D. and De Robertis, E. M.

      <str>The mouse T (Brachyury) deletion causes defective mesoderm formation and notochord morphogenesis, and abnormalities in the caudal neural tube and somites. To investigate the effect of the wild type T gene on concurrently expressed genes, we have compared expression of a panel of such genes in homozygous T mutants with that in wild type and heterozygous T/+ control embryos. Two classes of genes were used in this study: those implicated in primitive streak or mesoderm formation, and those which are differentially expressed in regions of the neural tube and somites. Results of wholemount in situ analysis show that the mRNA levels of Evx-1, Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a decrease in T/T embryos late in gastrulation, although earlier expression patterns are similar to control embryos. In contrast, BMP-4 and Msx-1 expression patterns remain similar throughout the period studied. Pax-3 and Pax-6, which are expressed in specific dorsoventral domains of the neural tube, both have ventrally extended expression domains in caudal T/T neural tube. This is consistent with a missing ventral signal provided by the notochord. However, the expression of Msx-1 in the most dorsal domain of the neural tube is unaltered in T/T embryos. Pax-1 and Pax-3, which are expressed in the sclerotome and dermamyotome respectively, are expressed correctly in anterior T/T somites, although the Pax-3 expression domain is widened ventromedially. This extension into ventromedial somite domains is more pronounced caudally, supporting a function for the notochord in ventralizing somites.</str>

      <str>RNA-binding protein TIAR has been suggested to mediate the translational silencing of ARE-containing mRNAs. To analyze the functions of TIAR, we established RNAi and genetic rescue assays. We evaluated the expression of neuroectoderm markers Pax6 and nestin, mesoderm markers brachyury and Flk1, and hypoblast and definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and Gata6 during EB differentiation and found that knockdown TIAR expression restrained the differentiation of E14 cells. We assessed gene expression levels of Flk-1 and VE-cadherin and observed attenuated differentiation of E14 cells into endothelial cells upon downregulation of TIAR gene expression. As such, we hypothesized an essential role of TIAR related to EB differentiation. As TIAR inhibits the translation of c-myc, we proposed that downregulation of TIAR results in restrained differentiation of E14 cells, due in part to the function of c-myc. We found that TIAR inhibited c-myc expression at the translational level in E14 cells; accordingly, a reduction of TIAR expression promoted self-renewal of pluripotent cells and attenuated differentiation. Additionally, we established that TIAR inhibited TIA-1 expression at the translational level in E14 cells. Taken together, we have contributed to the understanding of the regulatory relationships between TIAR and both c-myc and TIA-1. </str>

Strong expression of Xbra messenger RNA is found in the ring of involuting mesoderm during Xenopus gastrulation, and the expression of Xbra is an immediate-early response of animal pole blastomeres to mesoderm-inducing factors. To assess the role of Xbra in mesoderm formation, we increased its domain of expression in the embryo by microinjection of Xbra transcripts into the animal pole of Xenopus embryos at the one-cell stage. We show that expression of Xbra by cells of the early embryo is sufficient to direct their development into differentiated mesodermal tissues. At the molecular level this response shows a sharp threshold of sensitivity to the dose of Xbra RNA delivered, and we suggest that Xbra may act as a genetic switch initiating posterior mesodermal specification during embryogenesis.</str>

      <str>High expression of the B1 Sox genes, Sox2 and Sox3, is associated with the development of definitive neural primordia, the neural plates, in early stage embryos. However, in the caudal lateral epiblast (CLE) where axial stem cells reside, Sox2 and Sox3 are expressed at low levels, together with Brachyury. Because axial stem cells are the bipotential precursors of the neural plate and paraxial mesoderm, we investigated the possibility that low-level B1 Sox expression in CLE may regulate the fate of axial stem cells. We combined the genetic conditions of Sox3-null and Sox2 N1 enhancer homozygous deletion (Sox2(ΔN1/ΔN1)) to decrease B1 Sox expression in CLE. At 5-7 somite stages of mouse embryogenesis, these genetic manipulations caused approximately 30% higher production of paraxial mesodermal precursors, resulting in the development of larger somites. Analysis of mitotic cell populations suggested that decrease of B1 Sox expression in CLE does not activate cell proliferation but promotes cell migration into the mesodermal compartment. Thus, the low-level B1 Sox expression in CLE regulates axial stem cells to adjust the production of paraxial mesoderm precursors to an appropriate level. </str>

The EGFP reporter transgene is expressed in a pattern nearly identical to wnt8a, including maternal deposition, expression in the ventrolateral mesoderm and in the yolk syncytial layer. Loss of function studies show that wnt8a expression is under biphasic control by Nodal and No Tail/Brachyury, whereby early phase expression is Nodal-dependent but late phase expression is Ntl/Bra dependent. EGFP fluorescence persists in cells that transcribe the reporter, thus comprising a tracer for ventrolaterally derived mesodermal lineages. We use this property to show that wnt8a expression marks Nodal-independent tail mesoderm formation and that Ntl/Bra predominantly regulates wnt8a in paraxial mesoderm progenitors.</str>

      <str>ADAM19 is a member of the meltrin subfamily of ADAM metalloproteases. In Xenopus, ADAM19 is present as a maternal transcript. Zygotic expression starts during gastrulation and is apparent in the dorsal blastopore lip. ADAM19 expression through neurulation and tailbud formation becomes enriched in dorsal structures such as the neural tube, the notochord and the somites. Using morpholino knock-down, we show that a reduction of ADAM19 protein in gastrula stage embryos results in a decrease of Brachyury expression in the notochord concomitant with an increase in the dorsal markers, Goosecoid and Chordin. These changes in gene expression are accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylated AKT, a downstream target of the EGF signaling pathway, and occur while the blastopore closes at the same rate as the control embryos. During neurulation and tailbud formation, ADAM19 knock-down induces a reduction of the neural markers N-tubulin and NRP1 but not Sox2. In the somitic mesoderm, the expression of MLC is also decreased while MyoD is not. ADAM19 knockdown also reduces neural crest markers prior to cell migration. Neural crest induction is also decreased in embryos treated with an EGF receptor inhibitor suggesting that this pathway is necessary for neural crest cell induction. Using targeted knock-down of ADAM19 we show that the reduction of neural and neural crest markers is cell autonomous and that the migration if the cranial neural crest is perturbed. We further show that ADAM19 protein reduction affects somite organization, reduces 12-101 expression and perturbs fibronectin localization at the intersomitic boundary.</str>

      <str>During heart development at the gastrula stage, inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity affects the heart specification but does not impair the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA), which is first expressed in the heart mesoderm and recruited into initial heart myofibrils. Interaction of tissues between posterior epiblast and hypoblast at the early blastula stage is necessary to induce the expression of SMA, in which Nodal and Chordin are thought to be involved. Here we investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8) in the expression of SMA. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that Fgf8b is expressed predominantly in the nascent hypoblast. Anti-FGF8b antibody inhibited the expression of SMA, cTNT, and Tbx5, which are BMP-independent heart mesoderm/early cardiomyocyte genes, but not Brachyury in cultured posterior blastoderm, and combined FGF8b and Nodal, but neither factor alone induced the expression of SMA in association with heart specific markers in cultured epiblast. Although FGF8b did not induce the upregulation of phospho-Smad2, anti-FGF8b properties suppressed phospho-Smad2 in cultured blastoderm. FGF8b was able to reverse the BMP-induced inhibition of cardiomyogenesis. The results suggest that FGF8b acts on the epiblast synergistically with Nodal at the pregastrula stage and may play a role in the expression of SMA during early cardiogenesis.</str>

      <str>Sarcomatous transformation in chordoma (dedifferentiated chordoma) is a very rare condition and has been emphasized as a distinct entity because of its more aggressive clinical course. Here we describe a case of dedifferentiated chordoma (chordoma associated with malignant fibrous histiocytoma) arising from the sacrococcygeal region of a 55-year-old woman. The results of immunohistochemical stain in the chordoma area were strong positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and S-100 protein. The spindle and giant cells in the transitional areas of chordoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma were positive for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen in addition to vimentin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. The spindle and giant cells in the central area of malignant fibrous histiocytoma were negative for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen, but positive for vimentin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. This supports the pathogenesis of sarcomatous transformation from chordoma.</str>

      <str>We have identified a dorsal-ventral difference in the specification of mesoderm in vivo by examining the effect of the dominant-negative FGF receptor on a new member of the Xenopus caudal gene family, Xcad-3. Xcad-3 is expressed throughout the marginal zone during the gastrula stages and serves as a useful marker for events occurring within the mesoderm. Disruption of the FGF signaling pathway by the dominant-negative FGF receptor, disrupts the Xcad-3 expression pattern, eliminating expression preferentially from the dorsal regions of the embryo. We also find that the expression of the Xenopus brachyury homolog, Xbra, is more readily eliminated from the dorsal than the ventral region of the embryo by the dominant-negative FGF receptor, indicating that the observed dorsal-ventral differences are not unique to Xcad-3. These results demonstrate the importance of regional effects on FGF-mediated induction in vivo and suggest that FGF-dependent expression of mesodermal genes depends upon the localization of other factors which establish dorsal-ventral differences within the embryo.</str>

      <str>The zebrafish system offers many unique opportunities for the study of molecular biology. To date, only random mutagenesis, and not directed gene knockouts, have been demonstrated in this system. To more fully develop the potential of the zebrafish system, an approach to effectively inhibit the expression of any targeted gene in the developing zebrafish embryo has been developed. This approach uses a transient, cytoplasmic, T7 expression system, injected into the fertilized zebrafish egg to rapidly produce high levels of a ribozyme directed against the mRNA encoded by the targeted gene to inhibit its expression. In a demonstration of this strategy, expression of the recessive dominant zebrafish no tail gene was effectively inhibited by using this strategy to yield a phenotype identical to that resulting from a known defective mutation in this same gene. This, ribozyme-mediated, message deletion strategy may have use in determining the function of genetic coding sequences of unknown function.</str>

      <str>The S8 gene of the mouse contains a paired-like homeobox and is expressed during organogenesis in a complex pattern in mesenchyme. Here we show that S8 is first expressed in extraembryonic mesoderm of primitive streak stage embryos and that it is strongly expressed in mesoderm of early-headfold/neural plate stage embryos. It is, however, absent from the primitive streak and its immediately adjacent areas. Early after initial mesoderm formation, this expression domain defines a specific region of the mesoderm that, to some extent, foreshadows the later S8 expression pattern. The pattern at this stage is roughly complementary to that of the brachyury (T) gene. Expression in cell lines was studied both at the level of RNA and protein. Mesoderm specificity of S8 expression was confirmed in terminally differentiated cell lines. S8 is activated by retinoic acid in certain embryonal carcinoma cells, embryonic stem cells, and neural crest cell lines, and also during spontaneous differentiation in embryonic stem cells.</str>

      <str>Cellular competence is defined as a cell's ability to respond to signaling cues as a function of time. In Xenopus laevis, cellular responsiveness to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) changes during development. At blastula stages, FGF induces mesoderm, but at gastrula stages FGF regulates neuroectoderm formation. A Xenopus Oct3/4 homologue gene, XLPOU91, regulates mesoderm to neuroectoderm transitions. Ectopic XLPOU91 expression in Xenopus embryos inhibits FGF induction of Brachyury (Xbra), eliminating mesoderm, whereas neural induction is unaffected. XLPOU91 knockdown induces high levels of Xbra expression, with blastopore closure being delayed to later neurula stages. In morphant ectoderm explants, mesoderm responsiveness to FGF is extended from blastula to gastrula stages. The initial expression of mesoderm and endoderm markers is normal, but neural induction is abolished. Churchill (chch) and Sip1, two genes regulating neural competence, are not expressed in XLPOU91 morphant embryos. Ectopic Sip1 or chch expression rescues the morphant phenotype. Thus, XLPOU91 epistatically lies upstream of chch/Sip1 gene expression, regulating the competence transition that is critical for neural induction. In the absence of XLPOU91 activity, the cues driving proper embryonic cell fates are lost.</str>

      <str>Integrin cell surface receptors play an important role for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation during embryonic development by mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Less is known about the function of integrins during commitment and lineage determination of early embryogenesis. Homozygous inactivation of the beta1 integrin gene results in embryonal death in mice around the time of implantation. In vitro, differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells which lack beta1 integrin (beta1-/-) into the cardiogenic lineage is delayed and results in a disordered cellular specification (Fässler et al., J. Cell Sci. 109, 2989-2999, 1996). To analyze beta1 integrin function during myogenesis and neurogenesis we studied differentiation of beta1-/- ES cells via embryoid bodies into skeletal muscle and neuronal cells in vitro. beta1-/- cells showed delayed and reduced myogenic differentiation compared to wildtype and heterozygous (beta1+/-) ES cells. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated delayed expression of skeletal muscle-specific genes in the absence of beta1 integrin. Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies against the sarcomeric proteins myosin heavy chain, titin, nebulin, and slow C-protein showed that myotubes formed, but their number was reduced and the assembly of sarcomeric structures was retarded. In contrast, neuronal cells differentiating from beta1-/- ES cells appeared earlier than wildtype and heterozygous (beta1+/-) ES cells. This was shown by the accelerated expression of neuron-specific genes and an increased number of neuronal cells in beta1-/- embryoid bodies. However, neuronal outgrowth was retarded in the absence of beta1 integrin. No functional difference between wildtype and beta1-/- cells was found with respect to secretion of gamma-aminobutyric acid, the main neurotransmitter of ES cell-derived neuronal cells. The lineage-specific effects of loss of beta1 integrin function, that is the inhibition of mesodermal and acceleration of neuroectodermal differentiation, were supported by differential expression of genes encoding lineage-specific transcription factors (Brachyury, Pax-6, Mash1) and signaling molecules (BMP-4 and Wnt-1). Because of the reduced and delayed expression of the BMP-4 encoding gene in beta1-/- cells, we analyzed in wildtype and beta1-/- cells the regulatory role of exogenously added BMP-4 on the expression of the mesodermal and neuronal marker genes, Brachyury and wnt-1, respectively. The data suggest that BMP-4 plays a regulatory role during differentiation of wildtype and beta1-/- cells by modifying mesodermal and neuronal pathways. The reduced expression of BMP-4 in beta1-/- cells may account for the accelerated neuronal differentiation in beta1-/- ES cells.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cell lines that possess virtually unlimited self-renewal and differentiation capacity. Such characteristics make them potentially an invaluable cell source for diverse tissue-engineering applications. In vitro ES cell differentiation occurs spontaneously in three-dimensional structures termed "embryoid bodies" that mimic postimplantation embryonic tissue. HPRT, beta-tubulin, and GAPDH are commonly used as internal RNA standards in ES cell-derived gene transcription studies so that corrected sample mRNA levels can be obtained for (semi) quantitative gene expression data. However, if reliable data is to be obtained, it is essential that such housekeeping gene expression remains constant, and this has not been demonstrated for differentiating ES cell cultures, which represent a mixed and changing population of cells with time in culture. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the suitability of these housekeeping genes to act as true internal standards for differentiating murine ES cells cultured as embryoid bodies. PCR-amplified gene-specific products were quantified from digital images of ethidium bromide-stained gels using a computer software package. Both HPRT and beta-tubulin mRNA levels varied markedly in spontaneously differentiating and growth factor-supplemented (TGF-beta) ES cell cultures (p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA), while GAPDH expression remained relatively constant (p &gt; 0.2). Our results demonstrate the importance of fully validating housekeeping gene expression in in vitro ES cell gene transcription studies and suggest that GAPDH may be a suitable candidate to act as an internal RNA standard, while both HPRT and beta-tubulin appear to be inappropriate. Finally, we demonstrate enhanced mesodermal differentiation of ES cell-derived cultures by treatment with TGF-beta through significant upregulation of Brachyury T expression, with a concomitant decrease in expression of the undifferentiated ES cell marker Oct-4.</str>

      <str>The notochordal cell (NC) of the nucleus pulposus (NP) is considered a potential NP progenitor cell, and early intervertebral disk (IVD) degeneration involves replacement of NCs by chondrocyte-like cells (CLCs). Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in maintaining the notochordal fate during embryogenesis, but is also involved in tissue degeneration and regeneration. The canine species, which can be subdivided into non-chondrodystrophic and chondrodystrophic breeds, is characterized by differential maintenance of the NC: in non-chondrodystrophic dogs, the NC remains the predominant cell type during the majority of life, with IVD degeneration only occurring at old age; conversely, in chondrodystrophic dogs the NC is lost early in life, with concurrent degeneration of all IVDs. This study investigated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the healthy, NC-rich NP and early degenerated, CLC-rich NP of both breed types by immunohistochemistry of β-catenin and relative gene expression of brachyury and cytokeratin 8 (notochordal markers) and Wnt targets axin2, cyclin D1, and c-myc. Both NCs and CLCs showed nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin protein expression and axin2 gene expression, but β-catenin signal intensity and Wnt target gene expression were higher in the CLC-rich NP. Primary NCs in monolayer culture (normoxic conditions) showed Wnt/β-catenin signaling comparable to the in vivo situation, with increased cyclin D1 and c-myc gene expression. In conclusion, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in the NC within the NC-rich NP and in culture supports the role of this cell as a potential progenitor cell; increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in early IVD degeneration may be a reflection of its dual role.</str>

      <str>Notch encodes a transmembrane protein that functions in intercellular signaling. Although there is one Notch gene in Drosophila, vertebrates have three or more with overlapping patterns of embryonic expression. We cloned the entire 7575-bp coding region of an amphioxus Notch gene (AmphiNotch), encoding 2524 amino acids, and obtained the exon/intron organization from a genomic cosmid clone. Southern blot and PCR data indicate that AmphiNotch is the only Notch gene in amphioxus. AmphiNotch, like Drosophila Notch and vertebrate Notch1 and Notch2, has 36 EGF repeats, 3 Notch/lin-12 repeats, a transmembrane region, and 6 ankyrin repeats. Phylogenetic analysis places it at the base of all the vertebrate genes, suggesting it is similar to the ancestral gene from which the vertebrate Notch family genes evolved. AmphiNotch is expressed in all three embryonic germ layers in spatiotemporal patterns strikingly similar to those of all the vertebrate homologs combined. In the developing nerve cord, AmphiNotch is first expressed in the posteriormost part of the neural plate, then it becomes more broadly expressed and later is localized dorsally in the anteriormost part of the nerve cord corresponding to the diencephalon. In late embryos and larvae, AmphiNotch is also expressed in parts of the pharyngeal endoderm, in the anterior gut diverticulum, and, like AmphiPax2/5/8, in the rudiment of Hatschek's kidney. A comparison with Notch1 and Pax5 and Pax8 expression in the embryonic mouse kidney helps support homology of the amphioxus and vertebrate kidneys. AmphiNotch is also an early marker for presumptive mesoderm, transcripts first being detectable at the gastrula stage in a ring of mesendoderm just inside the blastopore and subsequently in the posterior mesoderm, notochord, and somites. As in sea urchins and vertebrates, these domains of AmphiNotch expression overlap with those of several Wnt genes and brachyury. These relationships suggest that amphioxus shares with other deuterostomes a common mechanism for patterning along the anterior/posterior axis involving a posterior signaling center in which the Notch and Wnt pathways and brachyury interact.</str>

      <str>We describe the internal organization of murine embryoid bodies (EBs) in terms of the structures and cell types formed as Oct4 expression becomes progressively lost. This is done by making the EBs from iPS cells carrying a novel Oct4 reporter (Oct4-MerCreMer;mTmG) which is inducible, sensitive, and permanent in all cellular progeny. When these EBs are treated with tamoxifen, the Oct4 expressing cells switch from a red to a green fluorescence color, and this is maintained thereafter by all their progeny. We show that there is no specific pattern in which Oct4 is downregulated, rather it appears to be spatially random. Many of the earliest cells to lose Oct4 expression stain positive for markers of visceral endoderm (DAB2, α-fetoprotein (AFP), HNF4). These are randomly located, although if endoderm differentiation is allowed to commence before EB formation then an external layer is formed. This is true both of EBs made from the reporter iPS cells, or from an embryo-derived mouse ES line (R1 cells). Markers of the early body axis, Brachyury (BRA) and FOXA2, usually showed a concentration of positive cells in one region of the EB, but the morphology is not predictable and there are also scattered cells expressing these markers. These patterns are similar in R1 cells. Use of the Oct4 reporter showed a difference between BRA and FOXA2. BRA, which marks the early mesoderm, node and notochord, arises in Oct4 expressing cells on days 3-4. FOXA2, which marks the floor plate of the neural tube and definitive endoderm, as well as the node and notochord, arises at the same time but mostly in cells that have already lost Oct4 expression. Several clumps of cardiomyocytes are visible by days 7-8 of EB development, both in our iPS cells and in R1 cells. Using the Oct4 reporter we show that the cells forming these clumps lose Oct4 expression between days 3 and 5. Overall, our results indicate that EBs recapitulate normal development quite well in terms of the tempo of events and the appearance of specific markers, but they do not resemble embryos in terms of their morphology.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare bone tumors arising from remnants of the notochord. Molecular studies to determine the pathways involved in their pathogenesis and develop better treatments are limited. Alterations in microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer. miRNAs are small RNA sequences that affect transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in most eukaryotic organisms. Studies show that miRNA dysregulation is important for tumor initiation and progression. We compared the expression profile of miRNAs in chordomas to that of healthy nucleus pulposus samples to gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of chordomas. Results of functional studies on one of the altered miRNAs, miR-31, are presented. The comparison between the miRNA profile of chordoma samples and the profile of normal nucleus pulposus samples suggests dysregulation of 53 miRNAs. Thirty miRNAs were upregulated in our tumor samples, while 23 were downregulated. Notably, hsa-miR-140-3p and hsa-miR-148a were upregulated in most chordomas relative to levels in nucleus pulposus cells. Two other miRNAs, hsa-miR-31 and hsa-miR-222, were downregulated in chordomas compared with the control group. Quantification with real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed up or downregulation of these miRNAs among all samples. Functional analyses showed that hsa-miR-31 has an apoptotic effect on chordoma cells and downregulates the expression of c-MET and radixin. miRNA profiling showed that hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-140-3p and hsa-miR-148a are differentially expressed in chordomas compared with healthy nucleus pulposus.

      <str>Mouse embryos homozygous for the mutation embryonic ectoderm development (eed) exhibit a growth defect and fail to gastrulate normally. While extraembryonic mesoderm is produced extensively, very little embryonic mesoderm is detected in eed mutant embryos, and there is no subsequent organization of mesoderm into node, notochord, or somites. The phenotype is consistent with a defect in the distal primitive streak. Here we report additional phenotypic analyses that include mRNA in situ hybridization of genes whose expression reflects the function of different regions of the primitive streak and their derivatives. These studies have confirmed that mesoderm derived from the proximal primitive streak is specified appropriately. Despite the absence of a morphologically distinct node, sparse axial mesoderm cells in eed mutant embryos are specified, as reflected by expression of Brachyury (T), Sonic hedgehog, and Tcf3b/HNF-3 beta, and definitive endoderm is produced. Specification of these cell types is also independent of correct expression of nodal, Fgf4, and gsc. Finally, T and Evx1 display ectopic expression in cells not normally fated to ingress through the primitive streak. The data presented are discussed in terms of mechanisms for establishment of the eed phenotype, and are consistent with the eed gene product playing an early role in primitive streak formation and/or organization.</str>

      <str>Formation of mesoderm is a crucial event in vertebrate development, establishing many of the important features of the body. Recent studies have implicated molecules that are similar to growth factors in mesoderm formation in Xenopus, but other gene products involved in this process have yet to be identified. Genetic evidence indicates that in the mouse the T gene (Brachyury) has a role in the formation and organization of mesoderm. Mice homozygous for mutant alleles of the T gene do not generate enough mesoderm, and show severe disruption in morphogenesis of mesoderm-derived structures, in particular the notochord. The cloning of the T gene has now allowed us to examine its expression pattern. We report that T-gene expression occurs in both early stage mesoderm and its epithelial progenitor, and then becomes restricted to the notochord. This expression pattern correlates with the tissues affected in the T-gene mutant, and indicates that the T gene has a direct role in the early events of mesoderm formation and in the morphogenesis of the notochord.</str>

      <str>We have examined the role of FGF signalling in the development of muscle and notochord and in the expression of early mesodermal markers in Xenopus embryos. Disruption of the FGF signalling pathway by expression of a dominant negative construct of the FGF receptor (XFD) generally results in gastrulation defects that are later evident in the formation of the trunk and tail, though head structures are formed nearly normally. These defects are reflected in the loss of notochord and muscle. Even in embryos that show mild defects and gastrulate properly, muscle formation is impaired, suggesting that morphogenesis and tissue differentiation each depend on FGF. The XFD protein inhibits the expression of the immediate early gene brachyury throughout the marginal zone, including the dorsal side; it does not, however, inhibit the dorsal lip marker goosecoid, which is expressed in the first involuting mesoderm at the dorsal side that will underlie the head. The XFD protein also inhibits Xpo expression, an immediate early marker of ventral and lateral mesoderm. These results suggest that FGF is involved in the earliest events of most mesoderm induction that occur before gastrulation and that the early dorsal mesoderm is already composed of two cell populations that differ in their requirements for FGF.</str>

      <str>The origin of different mesodermal tissues during gastrulation and the developmental lability of mesodermal precursors can be mapped by transplanting marked epiblast cells to the same or a different position in a host egg cylinder, and assessing the subsequent fate of transplanted tissue. This information provides the context for assessing the role of particular patterns of gene expression during mesoderm formation and differentiation. For example, the stability of Hox gene expression can be examined by transplanting transgenically marked somites that express a particular Hox gene to a position in the somite file where it is not normally expressed. Such experiments can reveal not only the cues required for Hox gene expression but also the relevance of a circumscribed pattern of Hox gene expression to a specific developmental fate. A different approach to resolving gene function is to mix mutant cells known to affect mesoderm formation with normal cells and to determine the cell autonomy of mutant cells in a normal environment. Homozygous Brachyury (T/T) embryonic stem cell lines have been isolated and injected into normal blastocysts. The presence of T/T cells in chimeras results in mesodermal defects similar to those seen in the intact mutant.</str>

      <str>We studied the effects in Xenopus embryos of overexpression of antisense RNA complementary to the messenger RNA of eFGF. We show that the expression of sense RNA can be severely depressed in the presence of an excess of antisense RNA. This occurs by both partial destruction of the message and by a depression of translation of the residual message. The diminution of inducing activity of eFGF, measured in animal cap assays either by activation of the Brachyury gene or by morphology, parallels the reduction of translation. Endogenous eFGF expression is reduced to a similar extent, again by a combination of mRNA destruction and inhibition of translation. This shows that the overexpression of antisense RNA is, contrary to general opinion, a potentially useful technique for studying gene function in Xenopus embryos. However, in the case of eFGF, there is little or no overall phenotypic effect on whole embryos. This is probably because of the presence of several other FGFs with overlapping expression domains in the early embryo.</str>

      <str>Mouse embryonic stem cells treated with retinoic acid are induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells (Bain et al. (1995) Dev. Biol. 168, 342-357). Here we have examined the expression of a set of neural- and mesoderm-specific genes during this in vitro differentiation process. mRNAs encoding the neural genes Wnt-1, MASH1, the light and medium isoforms of neurofilaments, and the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase are all strongly upregulated by retinoic acid treatment; expression of these genes occurs in a temporal pattern resembling that in the developing brain. In contrast, retinoic acid blocks the expression of the mesodermal genes Brachyury, cardiac actin, and zeta-globin. Thus, retinoic acid exerts both pro-neuronal and anti-mesodermal activities on mouse embryonic stem cells in culture.</str>

      <str>Both intercellular signaling and epigenetic mechanisms regulate embryonic development, but it is unclear how they are integrated to establish and maintain lineage-specific gene expression programs. Here, we show that a key function of the developmentally essential Nodal-Smads2/3 (Smad2 and Smad3) signaling pathway is to recruit the histone demethylase Jmjd3 to target genes, thereby counteracting repression by Polycomb. Smads2/3 bound to Jmjd3 and recruited it to chromatin in a manner that was dependent on active Nodal signaling. Knockdown of Jmjd3 alone substantially reduced Nodal target gene expression, whereas in the absence of Polycomb, target loci were expressed independently of Nodal signaling. These data establish a role for Polycomb in imposing a dependency on Nodal signaling for the expression of target genes and reveal how developmental signaling integrates with epigenetic processes to control gene expression.</str>

      <str>Dorsoventral mesoderm patterning in the amphibian embryo involves a series of interactions mediated by several peptide growth factors. Animal blastomeres isolated at the 8-cell stage are useful for studying mesoderm patterning, since they contain the prospective (uninduced) mesoderm region and allow examination of the default state of animal cells. When activin is applied to these dorsal and ventral animal half explants, a competence prepattern for responding to activin is observed. In order to investigate the characteristics of prepatterning, we treated animal blastomeres with the embryo dorsalizing agent LiCl. Treatment with lithium alone did not induce normal trunk mesoderm in either blastomere. Lithium did, however, alter the competence of animal blastomeres to activin. Dorsal mesoderm was formed in the ventral blastomeres, as well as in the dorsal blastomeres. This result reveals that the early dorsoventral polarity in the animal hemisphere is not fixed. Using goosecoid(gsc) and Xwnt-8 genes as dorsal and ventral mesoderm markers, it was verified that lithium modifies the competence to activin. Unexpectedly, lithium treatment on its own resulted in gsc expression in the animal half explants. This suggests that embryo goosecoid expression may be induced by the effect of dorsal determination activity, but not by mesoderm induction. However, lithium induced also the expression of brachyury (Xbra) gene at very low levels. This would indicate the formation of dorsal-anterior mesoderm, which was not identified by the tissue observations. Expression of Xwnt-8, a ventral mesoderm marker usually induced in blastula animal caps by activin, was hardly induced in the blastomere explants. We isolated whole animal half explants at the 8-cell stage and exposed to activin at different stages. It was found that the same concentration of activin induces gsc before the midblastula stage, and induces Xwnt-8 at later stages. This suggests that the response of animal blastomeres alters depending on the stage of activin signaling.</str>

      <str>The mGlu5 receptor is the only metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype expressed by mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown under non-differentiating conditions [Cappuccio, I., Spinanti, P. Porcellini, A., Desiderati, F., De Vita, T., Storto, M., Capobianco, L., Battaglia, G., Nicoletti, F., Melchiorri, D., 2005. Endogenous activation of mGlu5 metabotropic glutamate receptors supports self-renewal of cultured mouse embryonic stem cells. Neuropharmacology 1, 196-205]. We now report that ES cells differentiating into embryoid bodies (EBs) progressively lose mGlu5 receptors and begin to express mGlu4 receptors at both mRNA and proteinc level. A 4-day treatment of EBs with the mGlu4 receptor agonist, L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoate (L-AP4), increased mRNA levels of the mesoderm marker, brachyury and the endoderm marker, H19, and decreased the expression of the transcript for the primitive ectoderm marker, fibroblast-growth factor-5 (FGF-5). These effects were prevented by the mGlu4 receptor antagonists, alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP). Plating of EBs for 4 days in vitro in ITSFn medium induced cell differentiation towards a neural lineage, as reflected by the expression of the intermediate filament protein, nestin, and the homeobox protein, Dlx-2. Pharmacological activation of mGlu4 receptors during cell incubation in ITSFn medium increased the expression of both neural markers. Similar results were obtained when neural differentiation was induced by exposure of EBs to retinoic acid. These data suggest that differentiation of cultured ES cells is associated with changes in the expression pattern of mGlu receptors and that activation of mGlu4 receptors affects cell differentiation in a context-dependent manner.</str>

      <str>Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is associated with a loss of notochordal cells (NCs) from the nucleus pulposus (NP) and their replacement by chondrocyte-like cells. NCs are known to maintain extracellular matrix quality and stimulate the chondrocyte-like NP cells, making NCs attractive for designing new tissue engineering approaches for IVD regeneration. However, optimal conditions, such as osmolarity and other characteristics of the culture media, for long-term culture of NCs are not known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different culture media and osmolarity on the physiology of NCs in vitro. NC clusters isolated from canine IVDs were suspended in alginate beads and cultured at 37°C under normoxic conditions for 28 days. Three different culture conditions were investigated; (1) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (300 mOsm/L), (2) α-MEM (300 mOsm/L), and (3) α-MEM adjusted to 400 mOsm/L to mimic a hyperosmolar environment. NC morphology, expression of genes related to NC markers, matrix production and remodeling, and DNA- and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) analyses were performed on 1, 7, 14, and 28 days in culture. Large, vesicle-containing cells organized in clusters, characterized as NCs, remained present during 28 days for all culture conditions. However, the proportion of the NC clusters decreased over time, whereas the proportion of spindle-shaped cells increased. Gene expression profiling at 7, 14, and 28 days in culture compared to day 1 indicated a initial loss of NC phenotype followed by some recovery of brachyury and aggrecan gene expression after 28 days of culture supporting a potential recovery of NC phenotype. NCs cultured in α-MEM adjusted to 400 mOsm/L showed the highest gene expression of brachyury, cytokeratin 18, and aggrecan, the highest GAG production, and the lowest collagen 1α1 gene expression. In conclusion, NCs cultured in alginate in native cell clusters, partially retained their characteristic morphology and recovered their phenotype in long-term culture. The type of culture medium and medium osmolarity appear to be important factors for culturing NC clusters. These findings provide additional information concerning the maintenance of NCs in vitro that may aid further mechanistic inquiry into the biology of NCs.</str>

Among the tumors that were studied, only the mucinous carcinomas were positive for CEA.

Despite the provision of radical excision as a primary treatment, local recurrences ultimately develop in most patients with chordoma. For these reasons, postoperative therapy such as radiation therapy is often required. However, the chemotherapy, as the treatment of chordoma relapse, has not only limited experiences but also considerable controversy on its effectiveness. In addition, in the case of pulmonary nodules, it is difficult to diagnose or suspect pulmonary metastatic chordoma initially due to its rarity and similar histologic features to other malignancies. Herein, we present an interesting case of metastatic chordoma in a 52-year old woman, which has been well controlled by platinum-based chemotherapy.</str>

The presence of cytokeratin and EMA in chordoma implies the epithelial nature of the tumor and is extremely helpful as a differential marker for chordoma.

To investigate the expression and distribution of cell adhesion molecules in chordomas, we immunohistochemically studied the expression of representative cell adhesion molecules, E-cadherin, P-cadherin, N-cadherin, beta-catenin, CD44, ICAM-1 (CD54), NCAM (CD56), and VCAM-1 (CD106) in 16 tumors from 16 patients (skull base, n=5; cervical, n=2; sacral, n=9) and 3 cases of fetal notochord. Of 16 tumors, 12 (75.0%) expressed membranous immunoreactivity for NCAM, 10 (62.5%) for VCAM-1, 9 (56.3%) for CD44, 8 (50.0%) for N-cadherin, 6 (37.5%) for beta-catenin, 4 (25%) for ICAM-1, and 1 (6.3%) for P-cadherin. Nuclear staining for E-cadherin was recognized in 11 (68.8%) tumors, and membranous staining for E-cadherin in 3 (18.8%); none of the tumors showed both nuclear and membranous staining. Intranuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was not found in any chordoma. One fetal notochord case showed immunoreactivity for N-cadherin, E-cadherin (some cells showed staining in both cytoplasm and nuclei), CD44 and beta-catenin. These results indicate that chordomas frequently express immunoreactivity for multiple adhesion molecules including VCAM, CD44 and N-cadherin, as well as for NCAM and E-cadherin, as previously reported. These molecules may participate in producing the cellular cohesion evident in tumor morphological structure. Although the precise underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the high frequency of nuclear expression of E-cadherin (11 of 16 cases) may be diagnostically useful.</str>

It has been postulated that coexpression of GFAP and vimentin in neoplastic myoepithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas reflects early chondroid differentiation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in chondromyxoid and chordoid tumors was studied in formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 20 pleomorphic adenomas and 10 chordomas by the immunoperoxidase method with the use of commercially available monoclonal (n = 2) and polyclonal (n = 1) antibodies. All pleomorphic adenomas and chordomas demonstrated expression of GFAP with the use of the polyclonal antibody (Biomeda Corp [Foster City, Calif]). Variable expression of GFAP was present in 90% (18/20) and 70% (14/20) of pleomorphic adenomas, and in 20% (2/10) and 0% of chordomas, with the use of the two monoclonal preparations (Dakopatts [Glostrup, Denmark] and BioGenex Laboratories [San Ramon, Calif]), respectively. Normal brain tissue and eight astrocytomas were used as "controls" to compare staining intensity and quality between the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFAP antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity with the polyclonal antibody was more intense than that with either monoclonal antibody despite similar (congruent) distributions of tumor cell types that were stained in control brain and astrocytoma tissues. The GFAP polyclonal antibody was more frequently immunoreactive than the monoclonal antibodies, particularly in cells that exhibited chondroid differentiation. These findings may have practical application in surgical pathology.</str>

      <str>Miz1 is a member of the POZ domain/zinc finger transcription factor family. In vivo, Miz1 forms a complex with the Myc oncoprotein and recruits Myc to core promoter elements. Myc represses transcription through Miz1 binding sites. We now show that the Miz1 gene is ubiquitously expressed during mouse embryogenesis. In order to elucidate the physiological function of Miz1, we have deleted the mouse Miz1 gene by homologous recombination. Miz1(+/-) mice are indistinguishable from wild-type animals; in contrast, Miz1(-/-) embryos are not viable. They are severely retarded in early embryonic development and do not undergo normal gastrulation. Expression of Goosecoid and Brachyury is detectable in Miz1(-/-) embryos, suggesting that Miz1 is not required for signal transduction by Nodal. Expression of p21Cip1, a target gene of Miz1 is unaltered; in contrast, expression of p57Kip2, another target gene of Miz1 is absent in Miz1(-/-) embryos. Miz1(-/-) embryos succumb to massive apoptosis of ectodermal cells around day 7.5 of embryonic development. Our results show that Miz1 is required for early embryonic development during gastrulation.</str>

      <str>Patterning along the left/right axes helps establish the orientation of visceral organ asymmetries, a process which is of fundamental importance to the viability of an organism. A linkage between left/right and axial patterning is indicated by the finding that a number of genes involved in left/right patterning also play a role in anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning. We have recovered a spontaneous mouse mutation causing left/right patterning defects together with defects in anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning. This mutation is recessive lethal and was named no turning (nt) because the mutant embryos fail to undergo embryonic turning. nt embryos exhibit cranial neural tube closure defects and malformed somites and are caudally truncated. Development of the heart arrests at the looped heart tube stage, with cardiovascular defects indicated by ballooning of the pericardial sac and the pooling of blood in various regions of the embryo. Interestingly, in nt embryos, the direction of heart looping was randomized. Nodal and lefty, two genes that are normally expressed only in the left lateral plate mesoderm, show expression in the right and left lateral plate mesoderm. Lefty, which is normally also expressed in the floorplate, is not found in the prospective floor plate of nt embryos. This suggests the possibility of notochordal defects. This was confirmed by histological analysis and the examination of sonic hedgehog, Brachyury, and HNF-3 beta gene expression. These studies showed that the notochord is present in the early nt embryo, but degenerates as development progresses. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that the notochord plays an active role in left/right patterning. Our results suggest that nt may participate in this process by modulating the notochordal expression of HNF-3 beta.</str>

      <str>Human ESCs (HESCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cell lines that are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst-stage embryos. These cells can produce terminally differentiated cells representing the three embryonic germ layers. We thus hypothesized that during the course of in vitro differentiation of HESCs, progenitor-like cells are transiently formed. We demonstrated that LEFTY proteins, which are known to play a major role during mouse gastrulation, are transiently expressed during HESC differentiation. Moreover, LEFTY proteins seemed to be exclusively expressed by a certain population of cells in the early human embryoid bodies that does not overlap with the population expressing the ESC marker OCT4. We also showed that LEFTY expression is regulated at the cellular transcription level by molecular labeling of LEFTY-positive cells. A DNA microarray analysis of LEFTY-overexpressing cells revealed a signature of cell surface markers such as CADHERIN 2 and 11. Expression of LEFTY controlled by NODAL appears to have a substantial role in mesodermal origin cell population establishment, since inhibition of NODAL activity downregulated expression not only of LEFTY A and LEFTY B but also of BRACHYURY, an early mesodermal marker. In addition, other mesodermal lineage-related genes were downregulated, and this was accompanied by an upregulation in ectoderm-related genes. We propose that during the initial step of HESC differentiation, mesoderm progenitor-like cells appear via activation of the NODAL pathway. Our analysis suggests that in vitro differentiation of HESCs can model early events in human development.</str>

      <str>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been shown to play critical roles in vertebrate segmentation and elongation of the embryonic axis. Neither the exact roles of FGF signaling, nor the identity of the FGF ligands involved in these processes, has been conclusively determined. Fgf8 is required for cell migration away from the primitive streak when gastrulation initiates, but previous studies have shown that drastically reducing the level of FGF8 later in gastrulation has no apparent effect on somitogenesis or elongation of the embryo. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of both Fgf8 and Fgf4 expression during late gastrulation resulted in a dramatic skeletal phenotype. Thoracic vertebrae and ribs had abnormal morphology, lumbar and sacral vertebrae were malformed or completely absent, and no tail vertebrae were present. The expression of Wnt3a in the tail and the amount of nascent mesoderm expressing Brachyury were both severely reduced. Expression of genes in the NOTCH signaling pathway involved in segmentation was significantly affected, and somite formation ceased after the production of about 15-20 somites. Defects seen in the mutants appear to result from a failure to produce sufficient paraxial mesoderm, rather than a failure of mesoderm precursors to migrate away from the primitive streak. Although the epiblast prematurely decreases in size, we did not detect evidence of a change in the proliferation rate of cells in the tail region or excessive apoptosis of epiblast or mesoderm cells. We propose that FGF4 and FGF8 are required to maintain a population of progenitor cells in the epiblast that generates mesoderm and contributes to the stem cell population that is incorporated in the tailbud and required for axial elongation of the mouse embryo after gastrulation.</str>

      <str>To determine the chondrogenic, adipogenic, osteogenic, and neurogenic differentiation capacity of disc-derived stem/progenitor cells in vitro and neurogenic differentiation in vivo.</str>
      <str>Tissue repair strategies require a source of appropriate cells that could be used to replace dead or damaged cells and tissues such as stem cells. Here we examined the potential use of IVD-derived stem cells in regenerative medicine approaches and neural repair.</str>
      <str>Nonchondrodystrophic canine IVD nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were used to generate stem/progenitor cells (NP progenitor cells [NPPCs]) and the NPPCs were differentiated in vitro into chondrogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic lineages and in vivo into the neurogenic lineage. NPPCs were compared with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (stromal) stem cells in terms of the expression of stemness genes. The expression of the neural crest marker protein 0 and the Brachyury gene were evaluated in NP cells and NPPCs.</str>
      <str>NPPCs contain stem/progenitor cells and express "stemness" genes such as Sox2, Oct3/4, Nanog, CD133, Nestin, and neural cell adhesion molecule but differ from mesenchymal (stromal) stem cells in the higher expression of the Nanog gene by NPPCs. NPPCs do not express protein 0 or the Brachyury gene both of which are expressed by the totality of IVD NP cells. The percentage of NPPCs within the IVD is 1% of the total as derived by colony-forming assay. NPPCs are capable of differentiating along chondrogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic lineages in vitro and into oligodendrocyte, neuron, and astroglial specific precursor cells in vivo within the compact myelin-deficient shiverer mouse.</str>

      <str>Post-myocardial infarction cardiomyocytes are the most important target cell types for cardiac repair. Many of the applications envisaged for human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes demand that the differentiation procedure be robust, cost effective and high yielding. Various lines of evidence including our earlier study suggest that hESCs have distinct preferences to become heart cells. However, a direct comparison between different protocols has not yet been reported to date. Here, we performed a logical and systematic comparison of cardiomyocytes obtained from hESCs via embryoid bodies (EBs) in suspension versus adherent static cultures of feeder-free hES colonies representing three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) culture systems, respectively. An in-depth characterization of the beating cells revealed appropriate cardiac marker expression both at gene and protein levels. Despite using similar media, 3-D and 2-D cultures showed significant variation in growth and ability to form beating areas. While the expression of pre-cardiac mesoderm markers like GATA-4, HAND1, Myf5, Msx1, and BMP-IIR remained unaltered; levels of functional heart-specific markers such as MLC-2A/2V, cTnT, ANP, Phospholamban, α-MHC and KV4.3 were substantially up-regulated in 3-D compared to 2-D cultures. Concurrently we observed a sharp decline in the expression of ESC, ectoderm and endoderm markers including Oct-4, Sox-2, NFH, Sox-1, Sox-17 and AFP. Further immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry demonstrated a higher percentage of cells positive for Brachyury, desmin and cardiac troponin in 3-D cultures. Our results underscore the higher efficiency of cardiomyocytes derived via 3-D cultures. This finding enriches our basic understanding of the differentiation pattern in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes.</str>

      <str>Brachyury, a member of the T-box transcription family identified in a diverse array of metazoans, was initially recognized for its function in mesoderm formation and notochord differentiation in vertebrates; however, its ancestral role has been suggested to be in control of morphogenetic movements. Here, we show that morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of Brachyury (MlBra) in embryos of a ctenophore, one of the most ancient groups of animals, prevents the invagination of MlBra expressing stomodeal cells and is rescued with corresponding RNA injections. Injection of RNA encoding a dominant-interfering construct of MlBra causes identical phenotypes to that of RNA encoding a dominant-interfering form of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) in Xenopus embryos. Both injected embryos down-regulate Xbra downstream genes, Xbra itself and Xwnt11 but not axial mesodermal markers, resulting in failure to complete gastrulation due to loss of convergent extension movements. Moreover, animal cap assay reveals that MlBra induces Xwnt11 like Xbra. Overall results using Xenopus embryos show that these two genes are functionally interchangeable. These functional experiments demonstrate for the first time in a basal metazoan that the primitive role of Brachyury is to regulate morphogenetic movements, rather than to specify endomesodermal fates, and the role is conserved between non-bilaterian metazoans and vertebrates.</str>

      <str>The phenotypes of the p63 mutant mice are complex and diverse. The p63-/- mice develop severe defects in morphogenesis of ectodermal appendages, and p63+/- mice are tumor prone. Transcriptional targets of p63 with functions in both of these biological processes likely exist. Here, we identified one such direct transcriptional target of p63, brachyury, a gene with diverse roles in limb development and tumorigenesis. We found that brachyury is not expressed in developing p63-/- mouse embryos, and that in osteosarcomas, ΔNp63 and brachyury are expressed at high levels. Knock down of ΔNp63 in tumor cells resulted in a concomitant diminution of brachyury, cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These data provide evidence that suppression of ΔNp63 in tumors may lead to tumor regression through loss of cell proliferative and metastatic potential.</str>

      <str>Dedifferentiated chordoma, i.e. chordoma with a sarcomatous component, is a rare bone tumor. This case report is of a dedifferentiated chordoma in the sacrococcygeal region in a 50-year-old male. The patient was initially diagnosed as having a leiomyosarcoma at the first medical consultation, but after the tumor recurred it was proven to be a dedifferentiated chordoma. The primary tumor, which measured 7 x 5 cm, was located in front of the sacrum so as to compress the rectum forward. The resected specimen showed histological features of chordoma, but the presence in some parts of the tumor of spindle-shaped epithelial cells led to a misdiagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Thirty-six months later, a local recurrent tumor measuring 24 x 17 cm was identified and promptly resected. The recurrent tumor showed features of pleomorphic cell sarcoma mimicking malignant fibrous histiocytoma. In the pleomorphic sarcomatous area, many mitotic figures were seen, and the MIB-1 labeling index was greater than 40%, which was higher than that of the conventional chordoma area. From histological and immunohistochemical examination, the resected tumor was proven to be a dedifferentiated chordoma. This case highlights the importance of careful study of suspected chordoma to allow early identification of sarcomatous components. When we encounter a chordoma with a spindled epithelial component, we need to distinguish this tumor from a dedifferentiated chordoma and other spindle cell sarcomas such as leiomyosarcoma.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare neoplasm arising in the cerebrospinal axis from nothochordal remnants. The commonest location is in the sacrococcygeal area, then in the sphenooccipital region and less frequently in other parts of the vertebral column. Chordoma has been found in all age groups, but the greatest incidence was found between the fifth and the seventh decades: there is a male predominance. Signs and symptoms of chordoma are related to tumor location and are often present for a long period of time because of the slow growth of the neoplasia. Sacrococcygeal chordomas may produce lower back pain, bladder or anorectal dysfunction or mass. Three histologic subtypes are currently considered: conventional, chondroid and dedifferentiated chordoma. Comparing with conventional chordoma, chondroid chordoma shows a better prognosis while dedifferentiated chordoma has a worse prognosis. However the malignant potential of chordoma is most likely due to incomplete surgical excision because of the multifocality of the neoplastic growth. For that reason, local recurrence is common and accounts in large part for the mortality for this tumor. The best treatment consists of a wide surgical excision coupled with adjuvant radiation therapy. We report a case of sacrococcygeal chordoma arised in a 48 year-old-man; the clinical features of the tumor showed a close resemblance with a pilonidal cyst. When the diagnosis of conventional chordoma was done the patient were treated by surgery and by intraoperative radiotherapy followed by external radiotherapy. This peculiar therapy was adopted in the attempt to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Six months after this treatment the patient was well and no signs of local recurrence was found by the magnetic resonance imaging.</str>

      <str>Expression of HNF-4, a transcription factor in the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, is detected only in the visceral endoderm of mouse embryos during gastrulation and is expressed in certain embryonic tissues from 8.5 days of gestation. To examine the role of HNF-4 during embryonic development, we disrupted the gene in embryonic stem cells and found that the homozygous loss of functional HNF-4 protein was an embryonic lethal. Cell death was evident in the embryonic ectoderm at 6.5 days when these cells normally initiate gastrulation. As assessed by expression of Brachyury and HNF-3 beta, primitive streak formation and initial differentiation of mesoderm do occur, but with a delay of approximately 24 h. Development of embryonic structures is severely impaired. These results demonstrate that the expression of HNF-4 in the visceral endoderm is essential for embryonic ectoderm survival and normal gastrulation.</str>

      <str>In embryonic stem cells, Oct-4 concentration is critical in determining the development of endoderm, mesoderm, and trophectoderm. Although Oct-4 expression is essential for mesoderm development, it is unclear whether it has a role in the development of specific mesodermal tissues. In this study, we have examined the importance of Oct-4 in the generation of hematopoietic cells using an inducible Oct-4 ESC line. We demonstrate that Oct-4 has a role in supporting hematopoiesis after specifying brachyury-positive mesoderm. When we suppressed Oct-4 expression before or after mesoderm specification, no hematopoietic cells are detected. However, hematopoiesis can be rescued in the absence of Oct-4 after mesoderm specification if the essential hematopoietic transcription factor stem cell leukemia is expressed. Our results suggest that, for hematopoiesis to occur, Oct-4 is required for the initial specification of mesoderm and subsequently is required for the development of hematopoietic cells from uncommitted mesoderm.</str>

      <str>The present study aimed to estimate the clonogenic and differentiation potential of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Compared with mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, iPS cells were less sensitive to radiation. To examine the effect of ionizing radiation on the early differentiation pathway of iPS cells, we assessed embryoid body (EB) formation. Although EB formation was observed at all radiation doses, EB diameter decreased in a radiation dose-dependent manner. At the same time, we analyzed the expression of genes specific to differentiation in the initial iPS cells and cells of EB. The expression of the endoderm marker Afp increased remarkably in cells of EB derived from non-irradiated iPS cells; however, in irradiated cells, this expression significantly decreased in a radiation dose-dependent manner. Further, the expressions of the pluripotent stem cell markers Nanog and Oct-4 and the early mesoderm marker Brachyury significantly decreased. The results of the present study suggest that radiosensitivity with regard to gene expression differs at various stages in the early differentiation pathways of iPS cells that lead to the formation of the 3 germ layers; the sensitivity is the highest in the genes expressed during the differentiation pathways of iPS cells, leading to the formation of the endoderm.</str>

      <str>T-box genes encode transcription factors that play critical roles in generating the vertebrate body plan. In many developmental fields, multiple T-box genes are expressed in overlapping domains, establishing broad regions in which different combinations of T-box genes are coexpressed. Here we demonstrate that three T-box genes expressed in the zebrafish mesoderm, no tail, spadetail, and tbx6, operate as a network of interacting genes to regulate region-specific gene expression and developmental fate. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic analyses reveal three kinds of interactions among the T-box genes: combinatorial interactions that generate new regulatory functions, additive contributions to common developmental pathways, and competitive antagonism governing downstream gene expression. We propose that T-box genes, like Hox genes, often function within gene networks comprised of related family members.</str>

Whole-mount in situ hybridization shows that zebrafish atf7a is first expressed in the notochord precursors at 80% epiboly stage and then in the developing notochord during segmentation. The expression of atf7a is positively regulated by ntl, flh, and spr2, which are involved in development of the notochord. In contrast, atf7b is maternally expressed and during embryogenesis its mRNA is ubiquitously distributed, showing an expression pattern similar to that of mammalian Atf7.</str>

      <str>We have characterised the patterning capacity of the notochord on the somite using the murine Pax-1 gene as a ventral, and Pax-3 as a dorsal molecular marker. As model systems we chose the four mouse notochord mutants Brachyury curtailed (Tc), Danforth's short tail (Sd), Pintail (Pt) and truncate (tc). Their notochord either is initially absent or progressively degenerates. The use of these mutants enabled us to compare the effect of graded notochord deficiencies. All four mutants show premature termination of the vertebral column. This phenotype can be traced back to an impaired dorsoventral specification of the somites. In tc/tc and Tc/+ embryos the notochord in the affected regions is missing from the beginning. Consequently, Pax-1 is never activated, and Pax-3 remains to be expressed in the entire somite. In contrast, in Sd and Pt embryos the notochord secondarily degenerates. At the end of the prevertebral column Pax-1 expression is lost, while the Pax-3 signal occupies the former Pax-1 expressing zone. The altered pax gene expression in the notochord mutants suggests that the notochord is required for two processes in the dorsoventral patterning of the somite: first the induction of ventral structures, and second the maintenance of the ventral fate.</str>

      <str>Gsc-1 expression marks cells with Spemann organizer, or axis-inducing, activity in the vertebrate gastrula. Gsc-1 knockouts, however, did not display phenotypes related to the early phase of expression. In this paper, additional phenotypes for the Gsc-1 mouse mutant are presented. Examination of the base of the cranium in the dorsal view revealed fusions and deletions in the midline of the prechordal chondrocranium. These defects were correlated with the sites of expression of Gsc-1 in the prechordal plate/foregut endoderm in the day 7.5/8.5 embryo. Gsc-1 expression in proximal limb buds was correlated with malformations of the shoulder and hip articulations. In addition, ribs in the seventh cervical vertebra were observed with low penetrance. The role of Gsc-1 during gastrulation and axial development is discussed in relation to possible compensatory interactions with other genes such as HNF-3beta and the recently identified Gsc-2 and Gsc-3 genes.</str>

      <str>Chromosomal region 68D/E is required for various aspects of Drosophila gut development; within this region maps the Brachyury homolog T-related gene (Trg), DNA of which rescues the hindgut defects of deficiency 68D/E. From a screen of 13,000 mutagenized chromosomes we identified six non-complementing alleles that are lethal over deficiencies of 68D/E and show a hindgut phenotype. These mutations constitute an allelic series and are all rescued to viability by a Trg transgene. We have named the mutant alleles and the genetic locus they define brachyenteron (byn); phenotypic characterization of the strongest alleles allows determination of the role of byn in embryogenesis. byn expression is activated by tailless, but byn does not regulate itself. byn expression in the hindgut and anal pad primordia is required for the regulation of genes encoding transcription factors (even-skipped, engrailed, caudal, AbdominalB and orthopedia) and cell signaling molecules (wingless and decapentaplegic). In byn mutant embryos, the defective program of gene activity in these primordia is followed by apoptosis (initiated by reaper expression and completed by macrophage engulfment), resulting in severely reduced hindgut and anal pads. Although byn is not expressed in the midgut or the Malpighian tubules, it is required for the formation of midgut constrictions and for the elongation of the Malpighian tubules.</str>

      <str>Mechanical forces play an important role in the initial stages of embryo development; yet, the influence of forces, particularly of tensile forces, on embryonic stem cell differentiation is still unknown. The effects of tensile forces on mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation within a three-dimensional (3D) environment were examined using an advanced bioreactor system. Uniaxial static or dynamic stretch was applied on cell-embedded collagen constructs. Six-day-long cyclic stretching of the seeded constructs led to a fourfold increase in Brachyury (BRACH-T) expression, associated with the primitive streak phase in gastrulation, confirmed also by immunofluorescence staining. Further examination of gene expression characteristic of mESC differentiation and pluripotency, under the same conditions, revealed changes mostly related to mesodermal processes. Additionally, downregulation of genes related to pluripotency and stemness was observed. Cyclic stretching of the 3D constructs resulted in actin fiber alignment parallel to the stretching direction. BRACH-T expression decreased under cyclic stretching with addition of myosin II inhibitor. No significant changes in gene expression were observed when mESCs were first differentiated in the form of embryoid bodies and then exposed to cyclic stretching, suggesting that forces primarily influence nondifferentiated cells. Understanding the effects of forces on stem cell differentiation provides a means of controlling their differentiation for later use in regenerative medicine applications and sheds light on their involvement in embryogenesis. </str>

      <str>Follistatin is a secreted protein, which functions as an antagonist of different members of the TGF-beta superfamily, including activin and bone morphogenetic proteins. Expression of follistatin is tightly regulated during mouse development both spatially and temporally. In order to study the regulation of follistatin expression in the mouse embryo we have cloned and analyzed part of the 5' flanking region of the murine follistatin gene. Primer extension and RNase protection assays demonstrate that the murine follistatin promoter region has at least three distinct transcription initiation sites, which are each preceded by a TATA box. All of the transcription initiation sites are located within the first 500 bp upstream of the translational start site. Sequence analysis of this 500 bp region revealed several consensus binding sites for transcription factors including AP-1, Brachyury-T, CREB, Sp1, AP-2 and Tcf. To test whether the 5' region displays promoter activity, we transfected various 5' flanking region deletion constructs into F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and into P19 EC cells. In these two cell lines a region of only 262 bp upstream of the translation start site could drivereporter expression in a manner that reflects endogenous mRNA expression.</str>

Altered salinity and pH caused defects in axis formation and neural tube closure, delay in hatching, abnormal swimming of tadpoles and even developmental arrest. This was accompanied by significant decrease in the expression of selected development-regulating genes like goosecoid (required for gastrulation movements), brachyury (mesodermal marker gene), noggin (involved in neural induction), NCAM (required for neural cell adhesion) and MyoD (essential for muscle development), and considerable increase in the transcription of stress response genes hsp30 and hsp70.

      <str>Somites form by an iterative process from unsegmented, presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Notch pathway components, such as deltaC (dlc) have been shown to play a role in this process, while the T-box transcription factors Ntla and Tbx16 regulate somite formation upstream of this by controlling supply and movement of cells into the PSM during gastrulation and tailbud outgrowth. In this work, we report that Ntla and Tbx16 play a more explicit role in segmentation by directly regulating dlc expression. In addition we describe a cis-regulatory module (CRM) upstream of dlc that drives expression of a reporter in the tailbud, PSM and somites during somitogenesis. This CRM is bound by both Ntla and Tbx16 at a cluster of T-box binding sites, which are required in combination for activation of the CRM.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant tumors arising in bone of the spheno-occiput, sacrum, and vertebral column which can cause neurological deficit. Current management of chordoma involves safe resection followed by radiation therapy. However, surgical resection is often subtotal and chordoma often recurs despite optimal therapy. Despite years of effort, effective adjuvant therapy for denovo, recurrent and metastatic chordoma are absent and 5-year survival is at best 65%. While no chemotherapeutic agent has been demonstrated to be effective against chordoma in vivo, a greater understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of chordoma is opening up avenues of investigation towards the rational development of targeted therapies. Although enthusiasm for the use of already established or new investigational agents will increase with greater understanding of chordoma biology, laboratory studies of these agents are important prior to incorporation into clinical human trials. The authors review the current state of knowledge regarding chordoma and offer insight into potential new therapies for this rare and challenging tumor.</str>

      <str>In order to investigate the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of chordomas, 34 chordomas, with 5 chondrosarcomas for comparison, were studied by clinicopathological and immunohistochemical methods.</str>
      <str>Based on the presence or absence of cartilaginous areas, chordomas are classified into two subtypes: chondroid chordoma (14 cases) and classic chordoma (20 cases). Chondroid chordoma occurred in a younger age group (mean age 40.9 years) than classic chordoma (mean age 51.1 years). 7/14 (50%) of chondroid chordomas occurred in the sacrococcygeal region, 4/ 14 (28.6%) occurred in the spheno-occipital region. Immunohistochemical staining showed that all chordomas were positive for cytokeratin, and 16 (47.1%) chordomas were also positive for EMA. In contrast, 5 chondrosarcomas were immunonegative for both cytokeratin and EMA. Vimentin and S-100 protein were positive in the majority of chordomas (29 &amp; 24 respectively) and in the 5 chondrosarcomas. The present study confirms the dual features of chordoma-epithelial and mesenchymal, and also the utility of immunohistochemical staining in the differential diagnosis of chordoma and chondrosarcoma. The pathologic diagnosis of chondroid chordoma and other issues were also discussed in the study.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is an uncommon tumor initially believed to be benign due to the rarity of its metastasis. Cytological, morphological, and immunohistochemical features of chordoma, relating to its origin from notochordal remnants, allows for its accurate diagnosis. A 75-year-old man with a known history of tuberculosis (TB) presented with shortness of breath and a dry cough. A chest X-ray demonstrated a diffuse, infiltrative miliary pattern in both lungs. Bronchial washings submitted for culture and cytological examination did not identify any tuberculous bacilli. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed focal areas of myxoid regions with small, round, uniform mononuclear cells. There was a documented past history of chordoma arising from the L2 vertebrae. Because of the rarity of this lesion in the lung and the limited diagnostic material available with a clinical history of TB and lumbar chordoma, the pathological report rendered on the FNAC was "atypical cells suspicious for metastatic chordoma." A wedge biopsy of the lung confirmed the presence of metastatic pulmonary chordoma. Despite palliative treatment, he died within a year. Although the metastatic potential of chordomas has been recognized and documented, to the best of our knowledge, metastasis of chordoma to the lung diagnosed by FNAC with cytohistological correlation has not been previously reported in the English literature.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a relatively rare locally invasive and potentially malignant tumor of fetal notochord origin, affecting the axial skeleton. Cytopathological diagnosis of chordoma is favored by the presence of characteristic physaliphorous cells, bearing abundant foamy cytoplasm dispersed in a myxoid matrix. Anaplastic chordoma or dedifferentiated chordoma, an even rarer variant, can cause a diagnostic confusion with chondrosarcoma from the cytopathological point of view, with similar chondromyxoid matrix and atypical cells. Hence, chordoma bearing anaplastic features needs to be identified and should be distinguished from chondrosarcoma on aspiration cytopathology. We present a case of anaplastic sacral chordoma in a man 59 years of age, causing extensive destruction of sacrum and invading the paravertebral tissues as evidenced by radiology. Fine needle aspiration cytopathology revealed few large pleomorphic hyperchromatic cells, admixed with characteristic physaliphorous cells and myxoid matrix. The cytopathological diagnosis has been confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Since anaplastic chordoma bears an unfavorable prognosis, it should be suspected on preoperative aspiration cytopathology. Clinicoradiological correlation along with histopathological and immunohistochemical confirmation is necessary subsequently.</str>

The diagnosis is based on roentgenological data showing the connection of the tumor with axial skeleton (in sacral-coccygeus and occipital-basilar regions in 90% of cases) and on typical histologic structure.</str>

Demonstration of biological effectiveness, as indicated by pathological response of a chordoma specimen after such radiotherapy, has not previously been reported.</str>
      <str>A 72-year-old man presented with lower back pain and was found to have an L3 vertebral mass. Open biopsy yielded chordoma. He was considered for en bloc resection, but definitive radiation therapy was preferred owing to medical comorbidities and concern for field contamination from the previous biopsy.</str>

Pathology now showed near-complete necrosis of the resected chordoma.</str>

      <str>The mesoderm of Xenopus laevis arises through an inductive interaction in which signals from the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo act on overlying equatorial cells. One candidate for an endogenous mesoderm-inducing factor is activin, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily. Activin is of particular interest because it induces different mesodermal cell types in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that it acts as a morphogen. These concentration-dependent effects are exemplified by the response of Xbra, expression of which is induced in ectodermal tissue by low concentrations of activin but not by high concentrations. Xbra therefore offers an excellent paradigm for studying the way in which a morphogen gradient is interpreted in vertebrate embryos. In this paper we examine the trancriptional regulation of Xbra2, a pseudoallele of Xbra that shows an identical response to activin. Our results indicate that 381 bp 5' of the Xbra2 transcription start site are sufficient to confer responsiveness both to FGF and, in a concentration-dependent manner, to activin. We present evidence that the suppression of Xbra expression at high concentrations of activin is mediated by paired-type homeobox genes such as goosecoid, Mix.1, and Xotx2.</str>

      <str>Hypoxic environment is theoretically more physiological for the growth of human embryonic stem (hES) cells. It has been reported that hypoxic culture maintained better undifferentiation of hES cells, but the effects on differentiation are less well established. The hES cells were thus cultured and compared in hypoxia (2% oxygen [O2]) and normoxia (21% O2). The data showed that the undifferentiated state of hES cells was maintained more favorably in hypoxia during prolonged culture. Most tested genes belonging to FGF, TGF-beta/GMP, and Wnt signaling pathways were enriched in undifferentiated hES cells and downregulated upon differentiation, accompanied with differential expression of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FRAT2 between hypoxia and normoxia. Higher P-Smad2/3 level was identified in hypoxia, favoring the maintenance of hES cells in undifferentiation. Bisulfite sequencing showed similar imprinting status between different O2 tensions at H19 differentially methylated region (DMR) and KvDMR loci. Embryoid body formation was enhanced in hypoxia accompanied with suppressed Sox17, Desmin, Gata4, Brachyury, and Cdx2 expression. We concluded that hypoxia improved self-renewal of hES cells through modulation of major signaling pathways and was also more efficient for differentiation to embryoid bodies, though they might present with suppressed expression of some lineage-specific genes across all the three embryonic germ layers and trophectoderm.</str>

      <str>Gastrulation in higher vertebrate species classically commences with the generation of mesoderm cells in the primitive streak by epithelio-mesenchymal transformation of epiblast cells. However, the primitive streak also marks, with its longitudinal orientation in the posterior part of the conceptus, the anterior-posterior (or head-tail) axis of the embryo. Results obtained in chick and mouse suggest that signals secreted by the hypoblast (or visceral endoderm), the extraembryonic tissue covering the epiblast ventrally, antagonise the mesoderm induction cascade in the anterior part of the epiblast and thereby restrict streak development to the posterior pole (and possibly initiate head development anteriorly). In this paper we took advantage of the disc-shape morphology of the rabbit gastrula for defining the expression compartments of the signalling molecules Cerberus and Dickkopf at pre-gastrulation and early gastrulation stages in a mammal other than the mouse. The two molecules are expressed in novel expression compartments in a complementary fashion both in the hypoblast and in the emerging primitive streak. In loss-of-function experiments, carried out in a New-type culturing system, hypoblast was removed prior to culture at defined stages before and at the beginning of gastrulation. The epiblast shows a stage-dependent and topographically restricted susceptibility to express Brachyury, a T-box gene pivotal for mesoderm formation, and to transform into (histologically proven) mesoderm. These results confirm for the mammalian embryo that the anterior-posterior axis of the conceptus is formed first as a molecular prepattern in the hypoblast and then irrevocably fixed, under the control of signals secreted from the hypoblast, by epithelio-mesenchymal transformation (primitive streak formation) in the epiblast.</str>

      <str>EGF receptors are expressed on most fetal and adult cells but their precise roles are not well known. We previously reported that, in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, the expression of kinase-negative EGFR inhibits retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation to nervous tissue, suggesting that EGFR plays a role in differentiation (J.-X. Wu and E. D. Adamson (1993) Dev. Biol. 159, 208-222). Embryo stem (ES) cells differentiate into a wide range of tissue types after the removal of the cytokine LIF from the culture medium. We demonstrate here that the induction of some early markers of differentiation, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), AFP and keratins 8 and 19 is inhibited, whilst brachyury and myosin are increased, in clones containing kinase-negative mutant EGFR. After an extended period of differentiation, the cell types present in mutant and control cultures differed. Mutant clones produced frequent cardiac and skeletal muscle as the predominant differentiated cell types in vitro; other cells types were sparse or absent. Teratocarcinomas formed by EGFR-deltakinase-expressing ES cells contained frequent skeletal and cardiac muscle as well as apoptotic nuclei, while normal ES cells produced no detectable muscle and less apoptoses. Since mutant differentiated cultures had slower growth rates and increased levels of cell death, we concluded that: (1) inactive EGFR does not allow some cell types to survive and/or proliferate; (2) tissues that do not require EGFR for their survival, development or function predominate in long-term mutant cultures; (3) EGFR activity is not necessary for cardiac and skeletal muscle or endoderm formation and (4) Impaired survival of EGF-dependent lineages leads to preferential selection of muscle in differentiating ES cells.</str>

      <str>BCR-ABL oncogene, the molecular hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) arises in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell with both differentiation and self-renewal ability. To study the phenotypic effects of BCR-ABL in a clonal in vitro self-renewal and differentiation model, we have introduced BCR-ABL in the ES cell line CCE. The major effect of BCR-ABL expression was the persistence of primitive morphology of ES cells despite LIF deprivation, correlated with a constitutive activation of STAT3, the major self-renewal factor of ES cells, but no evidence of activation of STAT5. The enforced expression of BCR-ABL in an ES cell line, engineered to express a tetracycline-inducible dominant-negative form of a STAT3, triggered ES cell differentiation with an increased generation of hematopoietic cells expressing erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes. RT-PCR analysis for Oct4, Brachyury and beta-globin expression confirmed a delay of differentiation in BCR-ABL expressing clones, which could be entirely reversed upon activation of the dominant-negative form of STAT3. To study the possible relevance of STAT3 activation by BCR-ABL in human CML, Western blot analyses performed on the CD34+ cells, purified from CML patients at different stages of their disease, also demonstrated increased levels of STAT3 proteins phosphorylated both on tyrosine and serine residues. These results represent to our knowledge the first functional link between BCR-ABL oncogene and a self-renewal in the context of ES cells through constitutive activation of STAT3. Thus, the BCR-ABL embryonic stem cell model that we developed as well as the results obtained in human CML samples suggests a role for STAT3 in the pathogenesis of human CML.</str>

      <str>Modeling of pattern formation in hydra has revealed basic mechanisms that underlie the reproducible generation of complex and self-regulating patterns. Organizing regions can be generated by a local self-enhancing reaction that is coupled with an inhibitory effect of longer range. Such reactions enable pattern formation even in an initially almost homogeneous assembly of cells. A long-ranging feedback of the organizer onto the competence to perform the pattern-forming reaction stabilizes the polar axial pattern during growth and allows for regeneration with preserved polarity. Hypostome formation is assumed to be under the control of two positive feedback loops in which Wnt3 is a common element. In addition to the well-established loop employing beta-catenin, a second cell-local loop is involved, possibly with Brachyury as an additional component. This model accounts for the different expression patterns of beta-catenin and Wnt3. Wnt molecules are proposed to play a dual role, functioning as activators and, after processing, as inhibitors. Since Wnt genes code for complete pattern-forming systems, gene duplication and diversification lead to a family of genes whose expression regions have a precise relation to each other. Tentacle formation is an example of positioning a second pattern-forming system by medium-ranging activation and local exclusion exerted by the primary system. A model for bud formation suggests that a transient pre-bud signal is involved that initiates the formation of the foot of the bud, close to the normal foot, as well as close to the bud tip. Many dynamic regulations, as observed in classical and molecular observations, are reproduced in computer simulations. A case is made that hydra can be regarded as a living fossil, documenting an evolutionary early axis formation before trunk formation and bilaterality were invented. Animated simulations are available in the supplementary information accompanying this paper.</str>

      <str>Homozygous mutant (Shp-2Delta46-110) embryonic stem (ES) cells exhibit decreased hematopoiesis; however, the point at which Shp-2 is critical for ES cell differentiation to hematopoietic cells is unknown. We characterized the differentiation defect of Shp-2Delta46-110 ES cells by examining early points of differentiation, conducting leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-stimulated biochemical analysis, and performing in vitro reconstitution studies with wild-type (WT) Shp-2. ES cell in vitro differentiation assays were used to compare the differentiation of WT, Shp-2Delta46-110, and reconstituted ES cells to mesoderm, by measuring brachyury expression, to hemangioblasts, by measuring blast colony-forming cell (BL-CFC) formation and flk-1 expression, and to hematopoietic progenitor colony-forming cells, by performing secondary plating assays. LIF-stimulated phospho-Stat3 (known to be critical for ES cell self-renewal and maintenance of an undifferentiated state) and phospho-Erk levels were examined by immunoblotting. ES cell survival, using annexin V staining, and secondary embryoid body (EB) formation were also evaluated. Differentiation to both mesoderm and hemangioblasts was lower in Shp-2Delta46-110 cells compared to WT cells. On reconstitution with WT Shp-2, expression of brachyury and flk-1 and differentiation to hemangioblasts and primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors were restored. LIF-stimulated phospho-Stat3 levels were higher, whereas phospho-Erk levels were lower in Shp-2Delta46-110 ES cells than in WT and reconstituted cells. The increased phospho-Stat3 levels correlated with increased Shp-2Delta46-110 ES cell secondary EB formation and survival. We conclude that normal Shp-2 function is critical for the initial step of ES cell differentiation to mesoderm and to hemangioblasts and acts within the LIF-gp130-Stat3 pathway to maintain a proper balance of ES cell differentiation, pluripotency, and apoptosis.</str>

      <str>The capacity for self-renewal and differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells makes them a potential source for generation of pancreatic beta cells for treating type I diabetes mellitus. Here, we report a newly developed and effective method, carried out in a serum-free system, which induced human ES cells to differentiate into insulin-producing cells. Activin A was used in the initial stage to induce definitive endoderm differentiation from human ES cells, as detected by the expression of the definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and Brachyury. Further, all-trans retinoic acid (RA) was used to promote pancreatic differentiation, as indicated by the expression of the early pancreatic transcription factors pdx1 and hlxb9. After maturation in DMEM/F12 serum-free medium with bFGF and nicotinamide, the differentiated cells expressed islet specific markers such as C-peptide, insulin, glucagon and glut2. The percentage of C-peptide-positive cells exceeded 15%. The secretion of insulin and C-peptide by these cells corresponded to the variations in glucose levels. When transplanted into renal capsules of Streptozotocin (STZ)-treated nude mice, these differentiated human ES cells survived and maintained the expression of beta cell marker genes, including C-peptide, pdx1, glucokinase, nkx6.1, IAPP, pax6 and Tcf1. Thirty percent of the transplanted nude mice exhibited apparent restoration of stable euglycemia; and the corrected phenotype was sustained for more than six weeks. Our new method provides a promising in vitro differentiation model for studying the mechanisms of human pancreas development and illustrates the potential of using human ES cells for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus.</str>

This case report describes a 6-year-old girl with a mass in her left forearm measuring 11 x 6 cm. Foci of moderate nuclear atypia and various areas of necrosis were found in the tumor. Lung metastases were detected 3 months after diagnosis. Immunophenotyping revealed a strong, diffuse expression of pancytokeratin, S-100 protein, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and focal expression of chromogranin A. This is the fifth documented report on cases of metastasized parachordomas. It is rare for these neoplasms to show such aggressive behavior; moreover, immunoreactivity to chromogranin A is unexpected in these tumors.

We examine whether the cell adhesion molecule cadherin is involved in this process. Injections of dominant negative N-cadherin RNA into the region of 2- to 4-cell embryos that will give rise to muscle suppress MyoD expression in muscle progenitor cells. By contrast, Xbra expression is unaffected and levels of Xwnt-8 message rise with increasing doses of dominant negative cadherin RNA. MyoD inhibition in embryos injected with the dominant negative cadherin mRNA is rescued by coinjection of full-length cadherin RNA, showing that the inhibition of MyoD occurs through the cadherin pathway.

      <str>Studies on the role of the E-box binding transcription factor Snail2 (Slug) in the induction of neural crest by mesoderm (Shi et al., 2011) revealed an unexpected increase in the level of sizzled RNA in the dorsolateral mesodermal zone (DMLZ) of morphant Xenopus embryos. sizzled encodes a secreted protein with both Wnt and BMP inhibitor activities. Morpholino-mediated down-regulation of sizzled expression in one cell of two cell embryos or the C2/C3 blastomeres of 32-cell embryos, which give rise to the DLMZ, revealed decreased expression of the mesodermal marker brachyury and subsequent defects in neural crest induction, pronephros formation, and muscle patterning. Loss of sizzled expression led to decreases in RNAs encoding the secreted Wnt inhibitor SFRP2 and the secreted BMP inhibitor Noggin; the sizzled morphant phenotype could be rescued by co-injection of RNAs encoding Noggin and either SFRP2 or Dickkopf (a mechanistically distinct Wnt inhibitor). Together, these observations reveal that sizzled, in addition to its established role in dorsal-ventral patterning, is also part of a dynamic BMP and Wnt signaling network involved in both mesodermal patterning and neural crest induction.</str>

Structurally, XSPR-1 and XSPR-2 are closely related to the murine Sp5, which interacts genetically with Brachyury (Dev. Biol. 227 (2000) 358). XSPR-1 and XSPR-2 are expressed in broad and dynamic patterns during early development. Starting at gastrulation, XSPR-1 transcripts are restricted to the non-involuting marginal zone, and, at later stages, to the neuroectoderm, forebrain, otic vesicles and the midbrain/hindbrain boundary. In contrast, XSPR-2 expression is found predominantly within the presumptive mesoderm during gastrulation. At tailbud and tadpole stages, XSPR-2 is expressed exclusively in the tip of the tail.</str>

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and VEGFC, major transcription factors that regulate vasculogenesis, are activated in Tcea3 knocked down (Tcea3 KD) mESCs. Moreover, differentiating Tcea3 KD mESCs have perturbed gene expression profiles with suppressed ectoderm and activated mesoderm lineage markers. Most early differentiating Tcea3 KD cells expressed Brachyury-T, a mesoderm marker, whereas control cells did not express the gene.

It is a large complex of 30 subunits that is present in all eukaryotes. The Med12 subunit has been implicated not only in the regulation of Pol II activity, but also in the binding of transcription factors to the bulk of the Mediator complex. We targeted Med12 in mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate the in vivo function of this subunit. We report here the developmental defects of Med12 hypomorphic mutants that have a drastic reduction in Med12 protein levels. These mutants fail to develop beyond embryonic day 10 and have severe defects in neural tube closure, axis elongation, somitogenesis and heart formation. We show that in Med12 hypomorphic embryos, the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway is disrupted and that canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is impaired. In agreement with this, embryos that are incapable of Med12 expression failed to establish the anterior visceral endoderm or activate brachyury expression, and did not complete gastrulation.</str>

The expression of genes encoding muscle structural proteins and myogenic regulatory sequences of the MyoD1 family has been examined using 35S-labelled riboprobes. In the cardiac tube, actin and myosin genes are expressed together from an early stage, whereas in the myotome, the earliest skeletal muscle, they are activated asynchronously over days. They are not expressed in the somite prior to myotome formation. One potential muscle marker, carbonic anhydrase III, is expressed in early mesoderm and subsequently in the notochord, similarly to the Brachyury gene. The myogenic sequences are not detectable in the heart. In the myotome they show distinct patterns of expression; this is discussed in the context of their role as muscle transcription factors. myf-5 is the only myogenic factor sequence present in the somite prior to muscle formation and thus is potentially involved in an earlier step of muscle determination.

Inhibition of G9a histone methyltransferase by gene specific knockdown or BIX01294 treatment was sufficient to induce expression of precardiac markers Mesp1 and brachyury in bone marrow cells. BIX01294 treatment also allowed bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to express the cardiac transcription factors Nkx2.5, GATA4, and myocardin when subsequently exposed to the cardiogenic stimulating factor Wnt11. Incubation of BIX01294-treated MSCs with cardiac conditioned media provoked formation of phase bright cells that exhibited a morphology and molecular profile resembling similar cells that normally form from cultured atrial tissue. Subsequent aggregation and differentiation of BIX01294-induced, MSC-derived phase bright cells provoked their cardiomyogenesis. This latter outcome was indicated by their widespread expression of the primary sarcomeric proteins muscle α-actinin and titin. MSC-derived cultures that were not initially treated with BIX01294 exhibited neither a commensurate burst of phase bright cells nor stimulation of sarcomeric protein expression.

Strong support for the operation of a morphogen gradient mechanism in vertebrate development has come from the biochemical experiments of Green and Smith, who induced different kinds of gene expression in amphibian blastula cells exposed to small changes in activin concentration. But the interpretation of these experiments has been complicated by recent reports that cells tested for gene expression 3 hours after exposure to activin fail to show the graded response previously reported at 15 hours, a result suggesting that cells recognize their position in a gradient by an indirect mechanism. Here we conclude from the in situ analysis of blastula tissue containing activin-loaded beads that cells respond directly to changing morphogen concentrations in a way that resembles a ratchet-like process.</str>

It has previously been reported that BMPs induce differentiation of human ESCs into extraembryonic lineages. Here, we find that FGF2, acting through the MEK-ERK pathway, switches BMP4-induced human ESC differentiation outcome to mesendoderm, characterized by the uniform expression of T (brachyury) and other primitive streak markers. We also find that MEK-ERK signaling prolongs NANOG expression during BMP-induced differentiation, that forced NANOG expression results in FGF-independent BMP4 induction of mesendoderm, and that knockdown of NANOG greatly reduces T induction.

      <str>External guide sequence (EGS) technique, a branch of ribozyme strategy, can be enticed to cleave the target mRNA by forming a tRNA-like structure. In the present study, no tail gene (ntl), a key gene participating in the formation of normal tail, was used as a target for ribonuclease (RNase) P-mediated gene disruption in zebrafish in vivo. Transient expression of pH1-m3/4 ntl-EGS or pH1-3/4 ntl-EGS produced the full no tail phenotype at long-pec stage in proportion as 24 or 35%, respectively. As is expected that the full-length ntl mRNA of embryos at 50% epiboly stage decreased relative to control when injected the embryos with 3/4 EGS or m3/4 EGS RNA. Interestingly, ntl RNA transcripts, including the cleaved by EGS and the untouched, increased. Taken together, these results indicate that EGS strategy can work in zebrafish in vivo and becomes a potential tool for degradation of targeted mRNAs.</str>

      <str>Fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 protein (Fndc5) is an exercise hormone and its transcript profile in mouse showed high degree of expression in heart, skeletal muscle and brain. Our previous studies indicated a significant increase (approximately 10 fold) in mRNA level of Fndc5 when embryonic stem cells were differentiated into beating bodies. As a step closer to identify the involvement of Fndc5 in the process of cardiomyocyte differentiation, we generated a stably inducible transduced mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line that overexpressed Fndc5 following Doxycycline induction. Our results indicated that the overexpression of Fndc5 during spontaneous cardiac differentiation significantly increased not only at RNA levels for mesodermal markers but also at the transcriptional levels for cardiac progenitor and cardiac genes. These data suggest that Fndc5 may be involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Therefore, a new hope will be arisen for potential application of this myokine for regeneration of damaged cardiac tissues especially in cardiac failure. </str>

      <str>We have studied Xenopus tail development from the end of gastrulation to the commencement of outgrowth at the tail bud stage. We show that an early group of genes are expressed at the stage of tail bud determination, at the end of gastrulation, and a late group are expressed at around stage 27 just before tail bud outgrowth. Together, these genes define seven distinct regions of the tail bud as outgrowth commences. We have previously shown that formation of a tail bud depends on the interaction of three tissue regions, called N, M and C, at stage 13. Here we show that expression of the late group of genes is dependent on this NMC interaction. We describe molecular correlates of two of these regions, M and C, which were formerly unobservable and whose existence was inferred from embryological experiments.</str>

      <str>Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a novel Xenopus T-domain gene. In normal development, it is expressed in mesodermal cells in a ventral-to-dorsal gradient of increasing concentration. It reaches its peak expression 1-2 hr before any other known panmesodermal gene. It is strongly inducible by normal vegetal cells and by mesoderm-inducing factors. Ectopic expression of Eomes in animal caps induces the transcription of nearly all mesodermal genes in a concentration-dependent way. Overexpression of Eomes dorsalizes ventral mesoderm, inducing gsc and changing cell fate to muscle and notochord. Blocking the function of Eomes causes gastrulation arrest and defective mesoderm-dependent gene activation. We propose that Eomes fulfills an essential function in initiating mesoderm differentiation and in determining mesodermal cell fate.</str>

      <str>Insulin plays an extensively characterized role in the control of sugar metabolism, growth and homeostasis in a wide range of organisms. In vertebrate chordates, insulin is mainly produced by the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas, while in non-chordate animals insulin-producing cells are mainly found in the nervous system and/or scattered along the digestive tract. However, recent studies have indicated the notochord, the defining feature of the chordate phylum, as an additional site of expression of insulin-like peptides. Here we show that two of the three insulin-like genes identified in Ciona intestinalis, an invertebrate chordate with a dual life cycle, are first expressed in the developing notochord during embryogenesis and transition to distinct areas of the adult digestive tract after metamorphosis. In addition, we present data suggesting that the transcription factor Ciona Brachyury is involved in the control of notochord expression of at least one of these genes, Ciona insulin-like 2. Finally, we review the information currently available on insulin-producing cells in ascidians and on pancreas-related transcription factors that might control their expression. genesis 53:82-104, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. </str>

      <str>Using an expression cloning strategy that relies on a functional assay, we have cloned a novel Xenopus homeobox-containing gene, Siamois. Embryos injected in a ventral-vegetal blastomere with as little as 5 pg of Siamois mRNA develop a complete secondary axis, but the progeny of the injected cells do not participate in the secondary axis formation. In normal development, Siamois mRNA is first detected shortly after the midblastula transition, which is earlier than mRNAs for goosecoid or Xbrachyury, and is present most abundantly in the dorsal endoderm of early gastrulae. The activation of this gene can be obtained cell autonomously in dispersed embryo cells. These results indicate that Siamois may play an important role in the formation of the Nieuwkoop center.</str>

      <str>Prolyl 4-hydroxylase is the key enzyme of synthesis of collagens. Hydroxylation of a sufficient number of proline residues to hydroxyproline is necessary for the stability of triple helices in collagenous proteins, because non-hydroxylated non-triple-helical collagen polypeptide chains are degraded intracellularly. We studied 15 primary chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas, 17 benign bone tumours and one case of fibrous dysplasia and chordoma using immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against the alpha(I) and alpha(II) subunits of type I and II prolyl 4-hydroxylases, and with antibodies against collagen types I and II. Type I prolyl 4-hydroxylase was found to be the predominant isoenzyme in both types of bone sarcoma, whereas the type II enzyme was more readily expressed by benign tumours. A feature of collagen staining, that was common to both sarcoma types, was that collagen types I and II were mainly found within cancer cells and were rarely present extracellularly. Extracellular collagen staining was more obvious in benign tumours. The results show that expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase isoenzymes is altered in bone sarcomas as compared with normal bone tissue. Chondrous cells, which normally express mainly the type II isoenzyme, switch their expression pattern to that of type I. The findings provide evidence that type I is the major isoenzyme in malignant bone tumours, and probably in malignant neoplasms in general. The pattern of enzyme expression is considered to be associated with dedifferentiation of cancer cells.</str>

We investigated mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) protein expression and copy numbers of chromosome 7 in human chordomas. Furthermore, tumors were screened for gene fusions (PAX3-FKHR, ASPL-TFE3, and SYT-SSX) previously shown to be associated with MET activation in sarcomas. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from 66 chordoma samples. MET protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an immunoreactive score (IRS, scores 0-12). fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a dual-color DNA probe (7q31) for MET amplification was performed on TMA sections and RT-PCR for PAX3-FKHR, ASPL-TFE3 (type 1 + 2), and SYT-SSX (type 1 + 2) gene fusions on punch biopsies. All tumors (n = 66) expressed MET protein. FISH analysis of 33 tumors lacked MET gene amplification but showed polysomy of chromosome 7 in 15 (45.5%) tumors (13 low and two high polysomies). Although, polysomy 7 showed an increasing incidence with escalating MET IRS, this finding was not statistically significant. PAX3-FKHR, ASPL-TFE3, or SYT-SSX gene fusions were not demonstrable (n = 52). We found MET protein expression in all chordomas. A clear influence of polysomy 7 on MET protein expression could not be statistically demonstrated for this cohort.

      <str>The zebrafish homeobox gene floating head (flh) is essential for notochord development and is one of the earliest genes to be expressed in notochord precursors. To understand how flh is regulated during notochord development, we compared the wild-type flh expression pattern to that in embryos mutant for flh and no tail (ntl), the zebrafish homologue of Brachyury. In the early gastrula, the pattern of flh expression is not affected in either flh or ntl mutants, implying that the initial establishment of a gastrula notochord domain is independent of the function of these genes. However, flh RNA is expressed at lower levels in flh mutants suggesting that flh positively regulates its own expression. During gastrulation, flh mutants show an abrupt loss of flh expression in cells which have involuted and entered the hypoblast, while the rest of the expression pattern appears normal, thus flh+ function is specifically required to maintain flh expression in hypoblast cells. The anterior-most part of the notochord rudiment differentially maintains flh expression in both wild types and flh mutant embryos, suggesting that there is unique regulation of flh in this region of the developing notochord. In ntl mutants the spatial pattern of flh expression is altered as early as the late gastrula stage, becoming broad and diffuse. We hypothesize that ntl+ is required for the proper convergence movements of flh-expressing cells.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation via embryoid body (EB) formation is an established method that generates the 3 germ layers. However, EB differentiation poses several problems including formation of heterogeneous cell populations. Previously, we have enhanced mesoderm derivation from murine ESCs (mESCs) using conditioned medium (CM) from HepG2 cells. We used this technique to direct hematopoiesis by generating "embryoid-like" colonies (ELCs) from mESCs without standard formation of EBs. Two predifferentiation conditions were tested: (1) mESCs cultured 3 days in standard predifferentiation medium (control) and (2) mESCs cultured 3 days in HepG2 CM (CM-mESCs). Both groups were then exposed to primary differentiation for 8 days (ELC-formation period) and 14 days of hematopoietic differentiation. Enhanced mesoderm formation was observed in the CM-mESC group with an almost 5-fold increase in ELC formation (P ≤ 0.05) and higher expression of mesoderm genes-Brachyury-T, Goosecoid, and Flk-1-compared with those of control mESCs. Hematopoietic colony formation by CM-mESCs was also enhanced by 2-fold at days 7 and 14 with earlier colony commitment compared with those of control mESCs (P ≤ 0.05). This early clonogenic capacity was confirmed morphologically by the presence of nucleated erythrocytes and macrophages as early as day 7 in CM-mESC culture using standard 14-day colony-forming assay. Early expression of hematopoietic primitive (ζ-globin) and definitive (β-globin) erythroid genes and proteins was also observed by day 7 in CM-mESC cultures. These data indicate that hematopoietic cells more quickly differentiate from CM-mESCs, compared with those using standard EB approaches, and provide an efficient bioprocess platform for erythroid-specific differentiation of ESCs.</str>

      <str>To investigate T(Brachyury) gene function, a chimeric analysis of midgestation (9.5-11.5 days post coitum) embryos has been performed. Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines homozygous or heterozygous for the T gene have been introduced into wild-type host embryos by blastocyst injection, and the resulting chimeras scored for morphological abnormality and extent of colonization by T/T cells. As observed previously in earlier stage chimeras (Rashbass, P., Cooke, L. A., Herrmann, B. G. and Beddington, R. S. P. (1991) Nature 353, 348-350), 9.5-11.5 dpc T/T&lt;==&gt;+/+ chimeras exhibit many morphological features of intact T/T mutants. In addition, a dramatic bias of T/T cells towards caudal regions (such as tail and allantois) was observed in all chimeras tested. This is likely to result from accumulation of nascent T/T mesoderm cells with time near the primitive streak, possibly because of altered migration or adhesion properties. T/+ cells colonized rostral regions efficiently, but a slight bias towards the distal end of the tail was still evident. No such bias was observed in control chimeras. The presence of T/T cells in the allantois resulted in its failure to form a correct placental connection and thus arrested later development. In contrast, chimeras in which T/T cells were present predominantly in the tail developed normally but exhibited severe tail abnormalities such as foreshortening, branching and haemorrhagic cavities. Moreover, in these embryos, much higher levels of chimerism were present in the distal end of the tail than in younger (9.5 dpc) embryos. Later in gestation, such abnormal tails probably degenerated, giving rise to neonates with absent or severely abnormal tails but no evidence of chimerism. In situ analysis of T expression in the tail reveals that normally T is expressed highly in the tailbud (the growing portion of the tail) during its elongation between 9.5 and 11.5 dpc. Thus, evidence both from chimeras and from T expression in the tail suggest that T may play a role in the correct deployment of cells emerging from the tailbud.</str>

      <str>The T (Brachyury) deletion in mouse is responsible for defective primitive streak and notochord morphogenesis, leading to a failure of the axis to elongate properly posterior to the forelimb bud. T/T embryonic stem (ES) cells colonise wild-type embryos, but in chimeras at 10.5 days post coitum (dpc) onwards they are found predominantly in the distal tail, while trunk paraxial and lateral mesoderm are deficient in T/T cells (Wilson, V., Rashbass, P. and Beddington, R. S. P. (1992) Development 117, 1321-1331). To determine the origin of this abnormal tissue distribution, we have isolated T/T and control T/+ ES cell clones which express lacZ constitutively using a gene trap strategy. Visualisation of T/T cell distribution in chimeric embryos throughout gastrulation up to 10.5 dpc shows that a progressive buildup of T/T cells in the primitive streak during gastrulation leads to their incorporation into the tailbud. These observations make it likely that one role of the T gene product is to act during gastrulation to alter cell surface (probably adhesion) properties as cells pass through the primitive streak. As the chimeric tail elongates at 10.5 dpc, abnormal morphology in the most distal portion becomes apparent. Comparison of T expression in the developing tailbud with the sites of accumulation of T/T cells in chimeras shows that T/T cells collect in sites where T would normally be expressed. T expression becomes internalised in the tailbud following posterior neuropore closure while, in abnormal chimeric tails, T/T cells remain on the surface of the distal tail. We conclude that prevention of posterior neuropore closure by the wedge of T/T cells remaining in the primitive streak after gastrulation is one source of the abnormal tail phenotypes observed. Accumulation of T/T cells in the node and anterior streak during gastrulation results in the preferential incorporation of T/T cells into the ventral portion of the neural tube and axial mesoderm. The latter forms compact blocks which are often fused with the ventral neural tube, reminiscent of the notochordal defects seen in intact mutants. Such fusions may be attributed to cell-autonomous changes in cell adhesion, possibly related to those observed at earlier stages in the primitive streak.</str>

      <str>The in vitro derivation of renal lineage progenitor cells is essential for renal cell therapy and regeneration. Despite extensive studies in the past, a protocol for renal lineage induction from embryonic stem cells remains unestablished. In this study, we aimed to induce renal lineages from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) by following in vivo developmental stages, i.e., the induction of mesoderm (Stage I), intermediate mesoderm (Stage II) and renal lineages (Stage III). For stage I induction, in accordance with known signaling pathways involved in mesoderm development in vivo, i.e., Nodal, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt, we found that the sequential addition of three factors, i.e., Activin-A (A), a surrogate for Nodal signaling, during days 0-2, A plus BMP-4 (4) during days 2-4, and A4 plus lithium (L), a surrogate for Wnt signaling, during days 4-6, was most effective to induce the mesodermal marker, Brachyury. For stage II induction, the addition of retinoic acid (R) in the continuous presence of A4L during days 6-8 was most effective to induce nephrogenic intermediate mesodermal markers, such as Pax2 and Lim1. Under this condition, more than 30% of cells were stained positive for Pax2, and there was a concomitant decrease in the expression of non-mesodermal markers. For stage III induction, in resemblance to the reciprocal induction between ureteric bud (UB) and metanephric mesenchyme (MM) during kidney development, we found that the exposure to conditioned media derived from UB and MM cells was effective in inducing MM and UB markers, respectively. We also observed the emergence and gradual increase of cell populations expressing progenitor cell marker CD24 from Stage I to Stage III. These CD24(+) cells correlated with higher levels of expression of Brachyury at stage I, Pax2 and Lim1 at stage II and MM markers, such as WT1 and Cadherin 11, after exposure to UB-conditioned media at stage III. In conclusion, our results show that stepwise induction by tracing in vivo developmental stages was effective to generate renal lineage progenitor cells from mESC, and CD24 may serve as a useful surface marker for renal lineage cells at stage II and MM cells at stage III.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare, slow growing malignant tumor arising from remnants of the fetal notochord. Surgery is the first choice for chordoma treatment, followed by radiotherapy, although postoperative complications remain significant. Recurrence of the disease occurs frequently due to the anatomy of the tumor location and violation of the tumor margins at the initial surgery. Currently, there are no effective drugs available for patients with chordoma. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is limited opportunity to test agents in clinical trials and no concerted effort to develop agents for chordoma in the pharmaceutical industry. To rapidly and efficiently identify small molecules that inhibit chordoma cell growth, we screened the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) containing approximately 2800 clinically approved and investigational drugs at 15 different concentrations in chordoma cell lines, U-CH1 and U-CH2. We identified a group of drugs including bortezomib, 17-AAG, digitoxin, staurosporine, digoxin, rubitecan, and trimetrexate that inhibited chordoma cell growth, with potencies from 10 to 370 nM in U-CH1 cells, but less potently in U-CH2 cells. Most of these drugs also induced caspase 3/7 activity with a similar rank order as the cytotoxic effect on U-CH1 cells. Cantharidin, digoxin, digitoxin, staurosporine, and bortezomib showed similar inhibitory effect on cell lines and 3 primary chordoma cell cultures. The combination treatment of bortezomib with topoisomerase I and II inhibitors increased the therapeutic potency in U-CH2 and patient-derived primary cultures.

      <str>Recent studies on Xenopus development have revealed an increasingly complex array of inductive, prepatterning, and competence signals that are necessary for proper mesoderm formation. In this study, we establish that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals through mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) to induce mesodermal gene expression. We demonstrate that a partially activated form of MAPKK restores expression of the mesodermal genes Xcad-3 and Xbra, eliminated by the dominant-negative FGF receptor (delta FGFR). Similar to the results reported earlier with delta FGFR, expression of a dominant-negative form of MAPKK (MAPKKD) preferentially eliminates the dorsal expression of Xcad-3 and Xbra. We tested whether the regional localization of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) could explain why both MAPKKD and delta FGFR eliminate the dorsal and not the ventral expression of Xcad-3 and Xbra. We show that ectopic expression of BMP-4 is sufficient to maintain the dorsal expression of Xcad-3 and Xbra in embryos containing delta FGFR and that expression of a dominant-negative BMP receptor reduces the dorsal-ventral differences in delta FGFR embryos. These results indicate that regional localization of BMP-4 is responsible for the dorsal-ventral asymmetry in FGF/MAPKK-mediated mesoderm induction.</str>

      <str>Inducible hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell lines represent a model for studying genes involved in self-renewal and differentiation. Here, gene expression was studied in the inducible human CD34+ acute myelogenous leukemia cell line KG1 using oligonucleotide arrays and suppression subtractive cloning. Using this approach, we identified Dlg7, the homolog of the Drosophila Dlg1 tumor suppressor gene, as downregulated at the early stages of KG1 differentiation. Similarly, Dlg7 was expressed in normal purified umbilical cord blood CD34+CD38- progenitors but not in the more committed CD34+CD38+ population. Dlg7 expression was not detected in differentiated cells obtained from hematopoietic colonies, nor was expression detected in purified T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes. When analyzed in different types of stem cells, Dlg7 expression was detected in purified human bone marrow-derived CD133+ progenitor cells, human mesenchymal stem cells, and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Overexpression of Dlg7 in mouse ES cells increased their growth rate and reduced the number of EBs emerging upon differentiation. In addition, the EBs were significantly smaller, indicating an inhibition in differentiation. This inhibition was further supported by higher expression of Bmp4, Oct4, Rex1, and Nanog in EBs overexpressing Dlg7 and lower expression of Brachyury. Finally, the Dlg7 protein was detected in liver and colon carcinoma tumors but not in normal adjacent tissues, suggesting a role for the gene in carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that Dlg7 has a role in stem cell survival, in maintaining stem cell properties, and in carcinogenesis.

      <str>Activin-like signaling plays an important role in early embryogenesis. Activin A, a TGF-beta family protein, induces mesodermal/endodermal tissues in animal cap assays. In a screen for genes expressed early after treatment with activin A, we isolated a novel gene, denoted as BENI (Brachyury Expression Nuclear Inhibitor). The BENI protein has a conserved domain at the N-terminus that contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and two other NLSs in the C-terminal domain. BENI mRNA was localized to the animal hemisphere at the gastrula stages and to ectoderm except for neural regions at stage 17; expression persisted until the tadpole stage. The overexpression of BENI caused gastrulation defects and inhibition of elongation of activin-treated animal caps with reduction of Xbra expression. Moreover, whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed reduced expression of Xbra in BENI mRNA-injected regions of gastrula embryos. Functional knockdown of BENI using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide also resulted in an abnormal phenotype of embryos curling to the dorsal side, and excessive elongation of activin-treated animal caps without altered expression of mesodermal markers. These results suggested that BENI expression is regulated by activin-like signaling, and that this regulation is crucial for Xbra expression.</str>

      <str>We present a description of the expression of the HNF-3 beta homolog axial (axl) in the developing zebrafish up to larva stages and compare it with that of sonic hedgehog (shh). Both genes are expressed in derivatives of all three germ layers in dynamic patterns that show substantial overlap, consistent with mutual regulatory interactions between the two genes. However, we also describe unique sites of expression of both axl and shh indicating that some aspects of their regulation are independent of one another. In no tail (ntl, zebrafish Brachyury) and floating head (flh, zebrafish Xnot1) mutants, both of which affect notochord development, early expression of axl in the organizer is unaffected, excluding a function for these genes in establishment of axl expression. At later stages, ntl and flh mutants show different effects on the expression of both axl and shh in the neuroectoderm of the trunk and tail reflecting their distinct contributions to the development of the midline mesoderm; in contrast to flh and ntl mutations whose effects are restricted to the trunk and tail, mutation of cyclops (cyc) affects axl and shh expression along the entire midline of the neuroectoderm. Endodermal expression of axl and shh is not affected by the mutations showing that development of the endoderm is under distinct control.</str>

      <str>An immunocytochemical investigation has been carried out on five cases of chordoma (2 of the sacrum, 2 in the spheno-occipital bone and 1 in the parapharyngeal area) to study the expression of the 5 classes of intermediate filaments (IF): cytokeratin (CK), desmin (DES), GFAP, neurofilaments (NF) and vimentin (VIM). Our results show that constant coexpression of CK, NF and VIM does occur in chordomas, whereas DES and GFAP are not demonstrable in tumor cells. The three detected IF are invariably present in all cell types but not in intracellular vacuoles or in the extracellular mucoid substance. The pattern of immunoreactivity of chordomas appears very unique as very few other neoplasms demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of 3 distinct IF. Only choroid plexus tumors have been shown to manifest CK-NF-VIM immunoreactivity. The complex immunophenotype of chordomas may be related to their supposed origin from the notochord which normally undergoes conspicuous changes in location and morphology during embryonal development. Such changes might require the contemporary presence of multiple IF; IF expression, in fact, is known to be related to cell function and morphology. Notochordal cells and their neoplastic counterpart may consequently express an IF pattern which reflects unique architectural and morphological variations occurring during embryonal and tumor growth. Together with the speculative value of the detection of CK, NF and VIM in chordomas, the unusual immunocytochemical pattern of these tumors might provide useful diagnostic tool in differential diagnosis.</str>

      <str>We have previously demonstrated that chordomas express activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRB) and that treatment with imatinib, which is capable of switching off the activation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including PDGFRB, benefits a number of patients. The aim of this study was to identify the possible presence of other activated RTKs and their downstream signaling effectors. Cryopreserved material from 22 naïve sporadic chordomas was investigated for the presence of activated RTKs and their cognate ligands and downstream signaling effectors by means of human phospho-RTK antibody arrays, Western blotting, and molecular analysis; immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to analyze the corresponding formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. We detected activated PDGFRB, FLT3, and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) of the PDGFR family and highly phosphorylated EGFR, HER2/neu, and (to a lesser extent) HER4 of the EGFR family. The detection of PDGFRB/PDGFB confirmed our previous data. The presence of activated EGFR was paralleled by the finding of high levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) and PDGFB co-expression and PDGFRB co-immunoprecipitation. Of the downstream effectors, the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways were both activated, thus leading to the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and 4E-BP1 among the regulators involved in translational control. Taken together, our results (i) provide a rationale for tailored treatments targeting upstream activated receptors, including the PDGFR and EGFR families; (ii) support the idea that a combination of upstream antagonists and mTOR inhibitors enhances the control of tumor growth; and (iii) indicate that the 4E-BP1/eIF4E pathway is a major regulator of protein synthesis in chordoma.</str>

      <str>Chondroid chordomas are cartilage-rich neoplasms, most often located in the spheno-occipital region, that have a better prognosis than classic chordomas. The immunohistochemical features of 19 classic and chondroid chordomas were studied retrospectively using avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase histochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Of the 19 tumors, all located in the spheno-occipital region, 5 exhibited predominantly chondroid morphologic features. The 14 classic chordomas showed the following pattern of antigen expression (percent of tumors positive): epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) 100%, AE 1/3 (a "cocktail" of monoclonal antibodies directed against low and high molecular weight epidermal cytokeratins) 100%, DP keratin (DPK) 100%, vimentin 100%, S100 86%, neuron specific enolase (NSE) 100%, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 57%, and HMB-45 (an anti-melanoma-associated antibody) 57%. The five chondroid chordomas exhibited the following pattern: EMA 0%, AE 1/3 0%, DPK 0%, vimentin 100%, S100 100%, NSE 100%, CEA 0%, and HMB-45 0%. The focal, weak HMB-45 positivity (performed on the index case because of a clinical concern of metastatic melanoma) seen in 57% of the classic chordomas is a previously unreported finding. This finding suggests either that classic chordomas are capable of HMB-45 expression or that this antibody has broader reactivity than previously recognized. The lack of cytokeratin, EMA, and CEA expression by the chondroid chordomas is similar to chondrosarcomas as reported in the literature and dissimilar to the classic chordoma group. These immunohistochemical findings suggest that chondroid chordomas may more validly be classified as low grade chondrosarcomas.</str>

Under these conditions we found that overexpression of miR-290 cluster in ESCs cannot prevent downregulation of Oct-4, but inhibition results in earlier downregulation of Oct-4 compared with the negative control. In consistence with previous findings that report ectopic expression of Brachyury during gastrulation in Argonaute-2 KO mice due to impaired miRNA function, we show that miR-290 cluster regulates negatively differentiation of ESCs towards mesodermal and germ cell lineage. These results suggest that although incapable to maintain pluripotent state alone, miR-290 cluster inhibits ESC differentiation and it is involved in the pathways controlling mesoderm and primordial germ cell differentiation. Finally, we provide proofs that members of this cluster target Dkk-1 gene, a Wnt pathway inhibitor, and affect this pathway, which can partially explain why miR-290 cluster favours pluripotency against differentiation.</str>

      <str>Recent studies have established a role for the phosphoinositide (PI) cycle in the early patterning of Xenopus mesoderm. In explants, stimulation of this pathway in the absence of growth factors does not induce mesoderm, but when accompanied by growth factor treatment, simultaneous PI cycle stimulation results in profound morphological and molecular changes in the mesoderm induced by the growth factor. This suggests the possibility that the PI cycle exerts its influence via crosstalk, by modulating some primary mesoderm-inducing pathway. Given recent identification of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as an intracellular mediator of some mesoderm-inducing signals, the present study explores MAPK as a potential site of PI cycle-mediated crosstalk. We report that MAPK activity, like PI cycle activity, increases in intact embryos during mesoderm induction. Phosphoinositide cycle stimulation during treatment of explants with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) synergistically increases late-phase MAPK activity and potentiates bFGF-induced expression of Xbra, a MAPK-dependent mesodermal marker.</str>

However, manipulating ES cell differentiation in vitro is a challenge due to, at least in part, heterogeneous gene induction. Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that undifferentiated mouse ES cells maintained in culture exhibit heterogeneous expression of Dppa3, Nanog, Rex1, Pecam1 and Zscan4 as well as genes (Brachyury/T, Rhox6/9 and Twist2) normally expressed in specialised cell types. The Nanog-negative, Rex1-negative or T-positive ES cell subpopulation has a unique differentiation potential.

      <str>Animals show behavioral asymmetries that are mediated by differences between the left and right sides of the brain. We report that the laterality of asymmetric development of the diencephalic habenular nuclei and the photoreceptive pineal complex is regulated by the Nodal signaling pathway and by midline tissue. Analysis of zebrafish embryos with compromised Nodal signaling reveals an early role for this pathway in the repression of asymmetrically expressed genes in the diencephalon. Later signaling mediated by the EGF-CFC protein One-eyed pinhead and the forkhead transcription factor Schmalspur is required to overcome this repression. When expression of Nodal pathway genes is either absent or symmetrical, neuroanatomical asymmetries are still established but are randomized. This indicates that Nodal signaling is not required for asymmetric development per se but is essential to determine the laterality of the asymmetry.</str>

      <str>A novel wingless gene was isolated from the marine colonial hydroid Hydractinia echinata. Alignments and Bayesian inference analysis clearly assign the gene to the Wnt5A group. In line with data found for the brachyury ortholog of Hydractinia, He-wnt5A is expressed during metamorphosis in the posterior tip of the spindle-shaped planula larva, suggesting that the tip functions as a putative organizer during metamorphosis. Additionally, the outermost cells of the posterior tip are omitted from apoptosis during metamorphosis. In order to investigate this putative organizer function, we transplanted the posterior tip of metamorphosing animals into non-induced larvae and into primary polyps 24 h and 48 h of age. In larvae, the tip induced formation of a secondary axis. In polyps the building of ectopic head structures was induced. Based on our data on axis formation, on gene expression similar to the organizers of other species, and the absence of regular apoptosis, we conclude that the posterior tip of the Hydractinia larva has organizing activity during metamorphosis.</str>

Annelids belong to the still poorly studied third large branch of the bilaterians, the lophotrochozoans, and have anatomic and developmental characteristics, such as a segmented body plan, indirect development through a microscopic ciliated larva, and building of the trunk through posterior addition, which are all hypothesized by some authors (including us) to be present already in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of bilaterians. All three genes are shown to be likely involved in the building of the anteroposterior axis around the slit-like amphistomous blastopore as well as in the patterning of the terminal anus-bearing piece of the body (the pygidium). In addition, caudal and even-skipped are likely involved in the posterior addition of segments.

      <str>Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me) are repressive marks that silence gene expression. The M phase phosphoprotein (MPP8) associates with proteins involved in both DNA methylation and histone modifications, and therefore, is a potential candidate to mediate crosstalk between repressive epigenetic pathways. Here, by performing immunohistochemical analyses we demonstrate that MPP8 is expressed in the rodent testis, especially in spermatocytes, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Interestingly, we found that MPP8 physically interacts with PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1) components which are known to possess essential function in testis development by modulating monoubiquitination of Histone H2A (uH2A) and trimethylation of Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27me3) residues. Knockdown analysis of MPP8 in HeLa cells resulted in derepression of a set of genes that are normally expressed in spermatogonia, spermatids and mature sperm, thereby indicating a role for this molecule in silencing testis-related genes in somatic cells. In addition, depletion of MPP8 in murine ES cells specifically induced expression of genes involved in mesoderm differentiation, such as Cdx2 and Brachyury even in the presence of LIF, which implicated that MPP8 might be required to repress differentiation associated genes during early development. Taken together, our results indicate that MPP8 could have a role for silencing genes that are associated with differentiation of the testis and the mesoderm by interacting with epigenetic repressors modules such as the PRC1 complex. </str>

However, it occurred predominantly between 14 and 48 h postfertilization, which overlaps the period in which ntl expression disappears in the notochord and the tailbud. This inverse correlation, together with the methylation-associated formation of an inaccessible chromatin structure at the ntl CpG island region, suggested the involvement of the de novo methylation in ntl repression.

To understand how cells recognize morphogen concentration, we have bound naturally labeled activin to cells and related this to choice of gene activation. We find that the increasing occupancy of a single receptor type can cause cells to switch gene expression. Cells sense ligand concentration by the absolute number of occupied receptors per cell (100 and 300 molecules of bound activin induce Xbra and Xgsc, respectively, i.e., 2% and 6% of the total receptors) and not by a ratio of occupied to unoccupied receptors. The long duration of occupancy explains a previously described ratchet effect.

Here we present evidence that a Ciona homolog of snail (Ci-sna) encodes a repressor of the Ci-Bra enhancer in the tail muscles. DNA-binding assays identified four Ci-Sna-binding sites in the Ci-Bra enhancer, and mutations in these sites cause otherwise normal Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes to be misexpressed in ectopic tissues, particularly the tail muscles. Selective misexpression of Ci-sna using a heterologous promoter results in the repression of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the notochord. Moreover, the conversion of the Ci-Sna repressor into an activator results in the ectopic induction of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the muscles, and also causes an intermixing of notochord and muscle cells during tail morphogenesis. These results suggest that Ci-Sna functions as a boundary repressor, which subdivides the mesoderm into separate notochord and tail muscle lineages.</str>

      <str>The fate of the blastopore during development in the bilaterian ancestor is currently not well understood. In deuterostomes, the blastopore forms the anus, but its fate in protostome groups is variable. This variability, combined with an absence of information from key taxa, hampers the reconstruction of the ancestral developmental mode of the Protostomia and the Bilateria. The blastopore fate of the bilaterian ancestor plays a crucial role in understanding the transition from radial to bilateral symmetric organisms. Priapulids have a conservative morphology, an abundant Cambrian fossil record, and a phylogenetic position that make them a key group in understanding protostome evolution. Here, we characterize gastrulation and the embryonic expression of genes involved in bilaterian foregut and hindgut patterning in Priapulus caudatus. We show that the blastopore gives rise to the anus at the vegetal pole and that the hindgut markers brachyury and caudal are expressed in the blastopore and anus, whereas the foregut markers foxA and goosecoid are expressed in the mouth in the animal hemisphere. Thereby, gastrulation in the conservatively evolving protostome P. caudatus follows strictly a deuterostomic pattern. These results are more compatible with a deuterostomic rather than protostomic (blastopore forms the mouth) or amphistomic (mouth and anus are formed simultaneously) mode of development in the last common bilaterian ancestor.</str>

      <str>Sall1 is a multi-zinc finger transcription factor that regulates kidney organogenesis. It is considered to be a transcriptional repressor, preferentially localized on heterochromatin. Mutations or deletions of the human SALL1 gene are associated with the Townes-Brocks syndrome. Despite its high expression, no function was yet assigned for Sall1 in embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2, two components of the core pluripotency network. Genome-wide mapping of Sall1-binding loci has identified 591 genes, 80% of which are also targeted by Nanog. A large proportion of these genes are related to self-renewal and differentiation. Sall1 positively regulates and synergizes with Nanog for gene transcriptional regulation. In addition, our data show that Sall1 suppresses the ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation. Specifically, the induction of the gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation. These data demonstrate a novel role for Sall1 as a member of the transcriptional network that regulates stem cell pluripotency.</str>

      <str>Paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates gives rise to all trunk and limb skeletal muscles, the trunk skeleton, and portions of the trunk dermis and vasculature. We show here that germline deletion of mouse pMesogenin1, a bHLH class gene specifically expressed in developmentally immature unsegmented paraxial mesoderm, causes complete failure of somite formation and segmentation of the body trunk and tail. At the molecular level, the phenotype features dramatic loss of expression within the presomitic mesoderm of Notch/Delta pathway components and oscillating somitic clock genes that are thought to control segmentation and somitogenesis. Subsequent patterning and specification steps for paraxial mesoderm also fail, leading to a complete absence of all trunk paraxial mesoderm derivatives, which include skeletal muscle, vertebrae, and ribs. We infer that pMesogenin1 is an essential upstream regulator of trunk paraxial mesoderm development and segmentation.</str>

      <str>Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate in vitro into three germ layers (endodermic, mesodermic, ectodermic). Studies on the differentiation of these cells to specific early differentiation stages has been aided by an ES cell line carrying the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) targeted to the Brachyury (Bry) locus which marks mesoderm commitment. Furthermore, expression of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor 2 (Flk1) along with Bry defines hemangioblast commitment. Isobaric-tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ(TM)) and phosphopeptide enrichment coupled to liquid chromatography separation and mass spectrometry allow the study of phosphorylation changes occurring at different stages of ES cell development using Bry and Flk1 expression respectively. We identified and relatively quantified 37 phosphoentities which are modulated during mesoderm-induced ES cells differentiation, comparing epiblast-like, early mesoderm and hemangioblast-enriched cells. Among the proteins differentially phosphorylated toward mesoderm differentiation were: the epigenetic regulator Dnmt3b, the protein kinase GSK3b, the chromatin remodeling factor Smarcc1, the transcription factor Utf1; as well as protein specifically related to stem cell differentiation, as Eomes, Hmga2, Ints1 and Rif1. As most key factors regulating early hematopoietic development have also been implicated in various types of leukemia, understanding the post-translational modifications driving their regulation during normal development could result in a better comprehension of their roles during abnormal hematopoiesis in leukemia.</str>

      <str>The T-box gene family, encoding related DNA-binding transcriptional regulators, plays an essential role in controlling many aspects of embryogenesis in a wide variety of organisms. The T-box genes exhibit diverse patterns of spatial and temporal expression in the developing embryo, and both genetic and molecular embryological studies have demonstrated their importance in regulating cell fate decisions that establish the early body plan, and in later processes underlying organogenesis. Despite these studies, little is known of either the regulation of the T-box genes or the identities of their transcriptional targets. The aim of this review is to examine the diverse yet conserved roles of several T-box genes in regulating early patterning in chordates and to discuss possible mechanisms through which this functional diversity might arise.

      <str>The T-box gene family was uncovered less than a decade ago but has been recognized as important in controlling many and varied aspects of development in metazoans from hydra to humans. Extensive screening and database searching has revealed several subfamilies of genes with orthologs in species as diverse as Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. The defining feature of the family is a conserved sequence coding for a DNA-binding motif known as the T-box, named after the first-discovered T-box gene, T or Brachyury. Although several T-box proteins have been shown to function as transcriptional regulators, to date only a handful of downstream target genes have been discovered. Similarly, little is known about regulation of the T-box genes themselves. Although not limited to the embryo, expression of T-box genes is characteristically seen in dynamic and highly specific patterns in many tissues and organs during embryogenesis and organogenesis. The essential role of several T-box genes has been demonstrated by the developmental phenotypes of mutant animals.</str>

      <str>During early mouse development, the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) secretes inhibitor and activator signals that are essential for establishing the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the embryo and for restricting mesoderm formation to the posterior epiblast in the primitive streak (PS) region. Here we show that AVE cells have an additional morphogenetic function. These cells express the transmembrane protein FLRT3. Genetic ablation of FLRT3 did not affect the signaling functions of the AVE according to the normal expression pattern of Nodal and Wnt and the establishment of a proper AP patterning in the epiblast. However, FLRT3(-/-) embryos showed a highly disorganized basement membrane (BM) in the AVE region. Subsequently, adjacent anterior epiblast cells displayed an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process characterized by the loss of cell polarity, cell ingression, and the up-regulation of the EMT and the mesodermal marker genes Eomes, Brachyury/T, and FGF8. These results suggest that the AVE acts as a morphogenetic boundary to prevent EMT and mesoderm induction in the anterior epiblast by maintaining the integrity of the BM. We propose that this novel function cooperates with the signaling activities of the AVE to restrict EMT and mesoderm induction to the posterior epiblast.</str>

      <str>Colinear HOX expression during hindbrain and spinal cord development diversifies and assigns regional neural phenotypes to discrete rhombomeric and vertebral domains. Despite the precision of HOX patterning in vivo, in vitro approaches for differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to posterior neural fates coarsely pattern HOX expression thereby generating cultures broadly specified to hindbrain or spinal cord regions. Here, we demonstrate that successive activation of fibroblast growth factor, Wnt/β-catenin, and growth differentiation factor signaling during hPSC differentiation generates stable, homogenous SOX2(+)/Brachyury(+) neuromesoderm that exhibits progressive, full colinear HOX activation over 7 days. Switching to retinoic acid treatment at any point during this process halts colinear HOX activation and transitions the neuromesoderm into SOX2(+)/PAX6(+) neuroectoderm with predictable, discrete HOX gene/protein profiles that can be further differentiated into region-specific cells, e.g., motor neurons. This fully defined approach significantly expands capabilities to derive regional neural phenotypes from diverse hindbrain and spinal cord domains. </str>

      <str>The mouse mutant curly tail (ct) develops tail flexion defects and spina bifida as the result of delayed or failed closure of the posterior neuropore (PNP). With the aim of identifying genes involved in the chain of events resulting in defective neurulation, which can be detected at day 10.5 of development, we examined the expression patterns of a number of genes implicated in patterning of axial structures, mesoderm and neuroepithelium. The genes analyzed were Shh, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, Brachyury, Hoxb1, Evx1, Fgf8, Wnt5a and Wnt5b. No differences could be detected between non-mutant embryos and ct/ct embryos with normal PNP size for any of these genes. Comparisons between ct/ct embryos with enlarged PNP and phenotypically normal ct/ct or nonmutant embryos showed differences only for Wnt5a. Expression of this gene was greatly reduced in the ventral caudal mesoderm and hindgut endoderm. Analysis of younger embryos revealed that prior to the stage at which embryos at risk of developing neural tube defects can be detected, the same proportion of ct/ct embryos shows reduced Wnt5a expression. The proportion of embryos showing reduced expression and almost undetectable expression of Wnt5a reflects the proportions of tail defects and spina bifida seen at later stages. We suggest that deficiency of Wnt5a signaling in the ventral caudal region tissues is an important component of the mechanism of development of the defects in affected curly tail mutant mice, and that it is causally related to decreased cell proliferation within the ventral caudal region. A possible relationship between decreased Wnt5a expression and reduced levels of heparan sulphate proteoglycan is discussed.</str>

      <str>Two types of axis-deficient embryos developed after deletion of the vegetal cytoplasm: wasp-shaped embryos and permanent-blastula-type embryos. In situ hybridization revealed that neither type of axis-deficient embryo expressed goosecoid or pax-6. brachyury was expressed in the constricted waist region of the wasp-shaped embryos but was not expressed in the permanent-blastula-type embryos. Further, we examined the effect of UV irradiation on Japanese newt embryos. Surprisingly, UV-irradiated Japanese newt eggs formed hyperdorsalized embryos. These embryos gastrulated in an irregular circular fashion with goosecoid expression in the circular equatorial region. At tailbud stage, these embryos formed a proboscis which is very reminiscent of that formed in hyperdorsalized Xenopus embryos. Transplantation of the marginal region of the UV-irradiated embryos revealed that the entire marginal zone had organizer activity. Thus we conclude that UV hyperdorsalizes Japanese newt embryos. Finally, lithium treatment of normal embryos at the 32-cell stage also resulted in hyperdorsalization. Lithium treatment of vegetally deleted embryos had two distinct results. Lithium treatment of permanent-blastula-type embryos did not result in the formation of dorsal axial structures, while the same treatment reinduced gastrulation and dorsal axis formation in the wasp-shaped embryos. Based on these results, we propose a model for early axis specification in Japanese newt embryos. The model presented here is fundamentally identical to the Xenopus model, with some important modifications. The vegetally located determinants required for dorsal development (dorsal determinants, DDs) are distributed over a wider region at fertilization in Japanese newt embryos than in Xenopus embryos. The marginal region of the Japanese newt embryo at the beginning of development overlaps with the field of the DDs. Gastrulation is very likely to be a dorsal marginal-specific property, while self-constriction is most probably a ventral marginal-specific property in Japanese newt embryos.</str>

      <str>Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), consisting of HIF1alpha and ARNT (HIF1beta) subunits, activates multiple genes in response to oxygen (O(2)) deprivation. Arnt(-/-) mice exhibit substantial defects in blood cell and vessel development. We demonstrate that hypoxia accelerates the expression of Brachyury (a mesoderm-specific transcription factor), BMP4 (a mesoderm-promoting growth factor) and FLK1 (a marker of hemangioblasts, the bipotential progenitor of endothelial and hematopoietic cells) in differentiating ES cell cultures. Significantly, proliferation of embryonic hemangioblasts (BL-CFCs) is regulated by hypoxia, as Arnt(+/+) ES cells generate increased numbers of FLK1(+) cells, and BL-CFCs with accelerated kinetics in response to low O(2). This response is HIF-dependent as Arnt(-/-) ES cells produce fewer FLK1(+) cells and BL-CFCs, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this defect is rescued when Arnt(-/-) ES cells are co-cultured with Arnt(+/+) ES cells. Vegf(+/-)or Vegf(-/-) ES cells generate proper numbers of FLK1(+) cells but fewer BL-CFCs, suggesting that additional factors regulated by HIF (other than VEGF) are involved in these early events. Thus, hypoxic responses are important for the establishment of various progenitor cells, including early mesoderm and its differentiation into hemangioblasts. Together these data suggest that ineffective responses to hypoxia in Arnt(-/-) embryos abrogate proper cardiovascular development during early embryogenesis, including the pathways controlling hemangioblast differentiation.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are both a potential source of cells for tissue replacement therapies and an accessible tool to model early embryonic development. Chemical factors such as soluble growth factors and insoluble components of the extracellular matrix are known to affect the differentiation of murine ESCs. However, there is also evidence to suggest that undifferentiated cells can both sense the mechanical properties of their environment and differentiate accordingly. By growing ESCs on flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates with varying stiffness, we tested the hypothesis that substrate stiffness can influence ESC differentiation. While cell attachment was unaffected by the stiffness of the growth substrate, cell spreading and cell growth were all increased as a function of substrate stiffness. Similarly, several genes expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation and implicated in early mesendoderm differentiation, such as Brachyury, Mixl1 and Eomes, were upregulated in cell cultures on stiffer compared to softer substrates. Finally, we demonstrated that osteogenic differentiation of ESCs was enhanced on stiff substrates compared to soft substrates, illustrating that the mechanical environment can play a role in both early and terminal ESC differentiation. Our results suggest a fundamental role for mechanosensing in mammalian development and illustrate that the mechanical environment should be taken into consideration when engineering implantable scaffolds or when producing therapeutically relevant cell populations in vitro.</str>

      <str>Stabilization of β-catenin, through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity, in conjunction with inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK) promotes self-renewal of naïve-type mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). In developmentally more advanced, primed-type, epiblast stem cells, however, β-catenin activity induces differentiation. We investigated the response of rat ESCs to β-catenin signaling and found that when maintained on feeder-support cells in the presence of a MEK inhibitor alone (1i culture), the derivation efficiency, growth, karyotypic stability, transcriptional profile, and differentiation potential of rat ESC cultures was similar to that of cell lines established using both MEK and GSK3 inhibitors (2i culture). Equivalent mouse ESCs, by comparison, differentiated in identical 1i conditions, consistent with insufficient β-catenin activity. This interspecies difference in reliance on GSK3 inhibition corresponded with higher overall levels of β-catenin activity in rat ESCs. Indeed, rat ESCs displayed widespread expression of the mesendoderm-associated β-catenin targets, Brachyury and Cdx2 in 2i medium, and overt differentiation upon further increases in β-catenin activity. In contrast, mouse ESCs were resistant to differentiation at similarly elevated doses of GSK3 inhibitor. Interestingly, without feeder support, moderate levels of GSK3 inhibition were necessary to support effective growth of rat ESC, confirming the conserved role for β-catenin in ESC self-renewal. This work identifies β-catenin signaling as a molecular rheostat in rat ESC, regulating self-renewal in a dose-dependent manner, and highlights the potential importance of controlling flux in this signaling pathway to achieve effective stabilization of naïve pluripotency.</str>

      <str>The expression of c-met proto-oncogene product (c-MET) has been reported to be related to invasive growth or tumor stage in some tumors, but little is known concerning the significance of c-MET expression in bone tumors. With use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and polyclonal antibody for c-MET, we studied the expression of c-MET in 122 cases of malignant bone tumors (43 osteosarcomas, 24 chondrosarcomas, 21 malignant fibrous histiocytomas of bone, 16 Ewing's sarcoma versus primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 18 chordomas), 65 cases of benign tumors and tumor-like lesions (including 8 giant cell tumors of bone, 8 chondroblastomas, 12 enchondromas, 7 osteochondromas, 10 fibrous dysplasias), 7 cases of articular cartilaginous tissue, and 10 cases of fetal vertebral tissue consisting of foci of enchondral ossification and notochordal tissue. In malignant tumors, c-MET expression was most frequently detected in chordoma (94.4%), followed by chondrosarcoma (54.2%) and osteosarcoma (23.3%). Among the osteosarcoma specimens, c-MET expression was frequently detected in the chondroblastic subtype (66.7%), but the incidence was low in the cases with other subtypes of osteosarcoma. We found no significant correlation between the c-MET expression and the histologic grade of malignancy in either osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. c-MET expression was either rarely observed or completely negative in malignant fibrous histiocytomas of bone (4.8%) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (0%). In benign tumors and tumor-like lesions, c-MET expression was frequently detected in cartilaginous tumors, such as chondroblastoma (62.5%), enchondroma (66.7%), and osteochondroma (71.4%), but no expression was observed in giant cell tumors of bone or any other benign tumors or tumor-like lesions. In normal tissue, c-MET expression was frequently detected in the articular cartilage (100%) and notochord (70.0%) specimens examined. We conclude that c-MET expression as frequent as that observed in the notochordal tissue, chordomas, articular cartilage, and cartilaginous tumors is related to the development of both normal tissue and chondroid tumors.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a tumor of the axial skeleton that is distinctly uncommon in children and adolescents. Previous observations have suggested that chordomas in pediatric patients differ from adult chordomas in presentation, morphology, and behavior. This study examines the clinical and histologic features of chordomas in young patients (&lt; or =25 years old). All cases from the Mayo Clinic files were graphed according to age and a bimodal distribution was observed. The 35 cases representing the youngest population were selected for review. Histopathology ranged from low cellularity tumors with lobulated architecture and abundant myxoid matrix (conventional chordoma), to those with varying amounts of chondroid matrix (chondroid chordoma), to more cellular tumors (atypical chordoma), and finally to neoplasms with high-grade spindle-cell differentiation (dedifferentiated chordoma). Over an average follow-up period of 129 months (range 1 to 501 months), there were 13 deaths (37%) and 3 patients with metastasis. This survival rate was slightly better than the reported mortality rate for adults with chordoma, but there was a subset of young patients (those with atypical chordoma) that had a significantly worse survival rate, suggesting that histologic subtyping may be predictive of prognosis.</str>

The gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings were identical to those of a classic chordoma. Parachordoma and myxoid chondrosarcoma were excluded from the differential diagnosis. Five previously reported cases of extra-axial chordoma were reviewed and found also to demonstrate clinical and pathologic features specific to chordoma, despite arising in an extra-axial location. Although rare, extra-axial chordoma does exist and should be recognized and managed in a similar fashion to its well-described counterpart. It must be differentiated from other histologic mimics, because the treatment and prognosis can differ significantly.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare tumor with slow growth developing from remnants of the notochord and thus appears in close relation to the axial skeleton. A Swedish national series collected over a period of 13 years, comprising 51 patients with a follow-up time of 8-20 years, was studied. Histologically all tumors had a typical appearance except two, which had characteristics of "chondroid chordoma". Fifty-seven per cent of the tumors were located in the sacrococcygeal region, 27 per cent in the spheno-occipital region and 16 per cent in the vertebrae. The peak age incidence was in the 6th and 7th decades. Male: female ratio was 1:1. The main symptoms were pain and neurologic disturbances. Skeletal destruction was noted radiographically in most instances. Intratumoral calcifications were rarely seen. The treatment was surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of these. There was only one long-term survivor without evidence of disease, a patient operated on for cervical chordoma 14 years earlier. Six other patients lived 8-18 years after diagnosis with chordoma. All other patients were dead; 39 died of chordoma, five of unrelated causes. Distant metastases were noted in 29 per cent. Chordoma constituted 17.5 per cent of all primary malignant bone tumors of the axial skeleton. The yearly incidence was 0.51 per million inhabitants in Sweden.</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a malignant bone tumor that grows slowly, often recurs locally, and metastasizes late. Although different treatment approaches exist, including radiation and surgery, the only curative treatment is early and complete surgical excision of the tumor. Immediate spinal stability must be achieved with appropriate replacement or bone graft with rigid fixation.</str>
      <str>The 11-year follow-up evaluation of a 42-year-old woman with L3 and L4 vertebral body chordoma treated with complete removal, femoral shaft allograft replacement, fusion, and rigid metal fixation is reported. The patient was observed with serial physical examinations, radiographs, and laboratory studies over 11 years.</str>
      <str>At this writing, 11 years after the resection of the L3 and L4 chordoma, the patient is asymptomatic without evidence of recurrence or metastasis.</str>
      <str>As reported, vertebral chordomas are not curable, but the authors' experience contradicts this. The surgeon should aim at a wide, or at least a marginal, excision followed by a stable reconstruction.</str>

      <str>Chondroid chordoma is a controversial and confusing entity that was originally described by Heffelfinger et al. (Cancer 1973; 32:410-420) as a biphasic malignant neoplasm possessing elements of both chordoma and cartilaginous tissue. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of chondroid chordoma has not been described. The aim of our investigation was to characterize the chondroid area of chondroid chordoma and to compare the FNA features with those of well-differentiated chondrosarcoma. Clival and cervical spine chondroid chordomas were studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Chondroid chordomas demonstrated an epithelial nature by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural studies. The FNA smears showed low cellularity, with loosely arranged or dispersed round cells in a myxoid background. Although the smears were similar to those of well-differentiated chondrosarcomas, they showed a positive reaction for epithelial markers. These findings reveal that chondroid chordoma is a variant of chordoma which possesses a hyaline matrix. Immunohistochemical demonstration of epithelial markers is useful to distinguish it from chondrosarcoma. Diagn. Cytopathol. 1999; 21:335-339.</str>

      <str>We present the case of a sacrococcygeal chordoma which recurred 15 years after the radical removal as a soft tissue tumor in the gluteal musculature. This tumor consisted of two parts: a chordoma without symptoms of aggressive cellular proliferation and a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. During the following 4 years several local recurrences of the malignant fibrous histiocytoma occurred in the gluteal musculature. The patient finally died of lung metastases. No chordoma tumor tissue was found in the lungs, in the gluteal musculature or in the sacrococcygeal bone area. Histology including electron microscopy revealed no proof of a transition of chordoma into malignant fibrous histiocytoma. It must be assumed that the secondary soft tissue tumor originated from residual chordoma cells which were implanted during the operation of the primary tumor. It remains unclear whether the malignant fibrous histiocytoma arose from mesenchymal stromal cells within the chordoma or directly from primitive neuroectodermal chorda cells which possess the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including mesenchymal cells.</str>

      <str>Chondroid chordoma is a rare variant of chordoma and is usually located in the sphenooccipital region. This tumor shows clinical and histologic features common to both conventional chordoma and low grade chondrosarcoma and has a better prognosis than either of those lesions. To our knowledge, there has been no English language report describing its cytologic features.</str>
      <str>The cytologic features of skull base chondroid chordoma observed in intraoperative crush and touch preparations from a 33-year-old female are reported. Touch cytology revealed round or stellate cells distributed in a mucoid background without a typical epithelial cordlike arrangement. The cells had variably vacuolated cytoplasm and round or oval nuclei and showed slight cellular pleomorphism. May-Giemsa staining was superior to Papanicolaou staining in demonstrating the mucoid matrix and vacuolated cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Additionally, crush preparations were effective in demonstrating well-differentiated chondroid elements. Immunocytochemistry with positivity for S-100 protein and cytokeratins was an essential adjunct in the cytologic diagnosis of chordoma and helped in distinguishing it from other chondrogenic tumors.</str>

      <str>Seven patients with chordoma and 2 patients with chondrosarcoma treated by endoscopic endonasal surgery between November 2002 and February 2006 were studied prospectively. The mean age was 35 years. The follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 39 months.</str>

      <str>Vertebrate axis development depends upon wnt8a transcription in a dynamic pool of mesoderm progenitors at the posterior pole of the gastrulating embryo. The transcriptional mechanisms controlling wnt8a expression are not understood, but previous studies identified two phases of wnt8a expression in zebrafish: Nodal-dependent activation during early gastrulation (phase I) and No tail (Ntl)-dependent regulation from mid gastrula stages (phase II).</str>
      <str>We identified two upstream cis-regulatory regions, proximal and distal, each of which possesses a promoter. The proximal regulatory region contains a margin-specific enhancer that is required for both the Nodal and Ntl responses. Phase I expression requires Nodal activation of the margin enhancer in combination with the transcription factor Zbtb4 and the distal regulatory region. Phase II expression requires Ntl regulation of the margin enhancer in the context of the proximal regulatory region. An additional mechanism is required to ensure the transition from phase I to phase II regulation. Analysis of stickleback wnt8a suggests this mechanism of regulation may be conserved.</str>

      <str>We have isolated a Xenopus homolog of the murine Mox-2 gene. As is the case for the mouse homolog, mesoderm specific expression of Xenopus Mox-2 (X. Mox-2) expression begins during gastrulation. Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we show that X. Mox-2 is expressed in undifferentiated dorsal, lateral and ventral mesoderm in the posterior of neurula/tailbud embryos, with expression more anteriorly detected in the dermatomes. In the tailbud tadpole, X. Mox-2 is expressed in tissues of the tailbud itself that represent a site of continued gastrulation-like processes resulting in mesoderm formation. X. Mox-2 is not expressed in the marginal zone of blastula, nor in the dorsal lip of gastrula, nor midline tissues (i.e. prospective notochord). Treatments that affect mesodermal patterning during embryonic development, including LiCl and ultraviolet light, and injection of mRNAs encoding BMP-4, or dominant negative activin and FGF receptors, produce changes in X. Mox-2 expression consistent with the types of tissues affected by these manipulations. X. Mox-2 expression is induced more in animal caps treated with FGF than those treated with activin. Together with the fact that X. Mox-2 activation in animal caps requires protein synthesis, our data suggest that X. Mox-2 is involved in initial mesodermal differentiation, downstream of molecules affecting mesoderm induction and determination such as Brachyury and goosecoid, and upstream of factors controlling terminal differentiation such as MyoD and myf5. X. Mox-2, therefore, is another useful marker for understanding the formation of mesoderm in amphibian development.</str>

      <str>Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) play important roles in the pattern formation of early vertebrate embryos. We have identified a zebrafish ortholog of human FGF17, named fgf17b. The first phase of fgf17b expression occurs in the blastodermal margin of late blastulae and in the embryonic shield of early gastrulae. The second phase starts after the onset of segmentation, mainly in the presomitic mesoderm and newly formed somites. Injection of fgf17b mRNA into one-cell embryos induces expression of the mesodermal marker no tail (ntl) and rescues ntl expression suppressed by overexpression of lefty1 (lft1). Overexpression of fgf17b dorsalizes zebrafish gastrulae by enhancing expression of chordin (chd), which is an antagonist of the ventralizing signals BMPs. In addition, overexpression of fgf17b posteriorizes the neuroectoderm. Simultaneous knockdown of fgf17b and fgf8 with antisense morpholinos results in reduction of chd and ntl. Knockdown of fgf17b can alleviate inhibitory effect of ectopic expression of fgf3 on otx1. These data together suggest that Fgf17b plays a role in early embryonic patterning. We also demonstrate that fgf17b and fgf8 have stronger mesoderm inducting activity than fgf3, whereas fgf17b and fgf3 have stronger activity in posteriorizing the neuroectoderm than fgf8. Like fgf8, activation of fgf17b expression depends on Nodal signaling.</str>

      <str>We have identified and characterized zebrafish eve1, a novel member of the Drosophila even-skipped (eve) gene family. eve1 RNAs are expressed initially in late blastulae with a peak during the gastrula stage, at which time expression is confined to ventral and lateral cells of the marginal zone of the zebrafish embryo. Later, eve1 transcripts are located in the most posterior part of the extending tail tip. We show that LiCl, known to dorsalize Xenopus embryos, has the same effect in zebrafish, resulting in embryos with exaggerated dorsoanterior structures. In LiCl-treated embryos, eve1 transcripts are completely absent. eve1 is therefore a marker of ventral and posterior cells. In the light of its ventroposterior expression domain, the localization of eve1 transcripts was analysed in spadetail (spt) and no tail (ntl), two mutants with abnormal caudal development. In sptb140 homozygous mutants, there is an accumulation of cells in the tail region, resulting from inadequate migratory behaviour of precursors to the trunk somites. These cells, in their abnormal environment, express eve1, emphasizing the correlation between ventroposterior position and eve1 expression. In homozygous mutant embryos for the gene ntl (the homologue of mouse Brachyury, originally called Zf-T), posterior structures are missing (M. E. Halpern, C. B. Kimmel, R. K. Ho and C. Walker, 1993; Cell In press). While mutant and wild-type embryos do not differ in their eve1 transcript distribution during gastrulation, eve1 expression is absent in the caudal region of mutant ntl embryos during early somitogenesis, indicating a requirement for ntl in the maintenance of eve1 expression during tail extension. Our findings suggest that eve1 expression is correlated with a ventral and posterior cell fate, and provide first insights into its regulation.</str>

      <str>In chordoma, complete surgical removal of the epidural tumor should be the first choice of treatment. Numerous surgical approaches to clival chordoma have been described: anterior approaches, lateral approaches, and posterolateral approaches. A multistaged operation with a combination of these approaches is generally performed. We used three approaches to remove a clival chordoma extending from the lower clivus anteriorly to the anterior perivertebral space and inferiorly to the C2 level. The epidural posterolateral approach through the vertebral artery (VA)-C2 interval space after resection of the C2 dorsal ganglion was the most effective. To our knowledge, the epidural posterolateral approach below VA, referred to as C2 ganglion sectioning epidural approach has not been reported as an independent approach in detail. We report a two-year-old girl with a lower clival chordoma which has been excised using C2 ganglion sectioning epidural approach.</str>

      <str>Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratins, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen and S-100 were performed on nine ecchordoses and 10 chordomas. 100% of the ecchordoses were positive for cytokeratin, vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen. 78% were S-100 positive. 100% of the chordomas stained positively for cytokeratin, vimentin and S-100 and 90% were positive for epithelial membrane antigen. No ecchordosis or chordoma was carcinoembryonic-antigen positive. These findings are interesting for two reasons. First, the similar staining properties of chordoma and ecchordosis physaliphora support the embryologic hypothesis of their common origin from the fetal notochord. Second, they indicate that when an ecchordosis causes symptoms prompting surgical resection, differentiation of the lesion from chordoma with routine immunohistochemistry would not be helpful.</str>

      <str>A case of clival chordoma in a 4-year-old girl is presented. The tumor regrew rapidly after it was partially removed, and the patient died after a clinical course of 11 months. An autopsy revealed a massive clival mass and widespread metastases in the dura mater, skull bone, bilateral lungs, liver, sternum, left humerus, and vertebrae. Pathological findings showed that the tumor cells were poorly differentiated, with a rare, but typical, physaliphorous appearance. The presence of epithelial differentiation proteins, mitochondria surrounded by rough endoplasmic reticulum, and desmosomes was demonstrated in the tumor cells both immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Thus, the tumor was diagnosed as a chordoma. The literature pertaining to intracranial chordoma in early childhood is reviewed. Rapid growth and distant metastases may occur in chordomas at a young age.</str>

      <str>A tumor with the light microscopic and immunohistologic characteristics of chordoma in the sacrococcygeal region in a 48-year-old man was examined by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for tubulin. A large population of cells exhibited prominent parallel arrays of long, straight microtubules in the rough endoplasmic reticulum in addition to the well-described ultrastructural features of chordoma. Immunoreaction to tubulin recognized in the juxtanuclear regions of the large number of tumor cells was in accordance with the ultrastructural localization of the microtubular aggregates. This seems to be the first report of microtubular aggregations in rough endoplasmic reticulum in classic chordoma.

      <str>Chordoma is an uncommon tumor of bone that is believed to develop from remnants of the notochord. The chondroid variant of chordomas contains elements possessing both chordoma and cartilaginous tissues. Chondroid chordomas occur almost exclusively in the sphenooccipital region of the skull base. Primary treatment with surgical excision and radiotherapy for residual or recurrent tumor is recommended. Here, we describe a patient with chondroid chordoma with skull base involvement who underwent an expanded endonasal endoscopic approach for complete resection. In conclusion, endonasal endoscopic approach should be kept in mind for the resection of carefully selected chondroid chordomas with skull base involvement because of its minimally invasive characteristics.</str>

Although the lesion exhibited the classic histological features of a chordoma, it differed significantly in its extraosseous location.

      <str>Zebrafish tiggy-winkle hedgehog (twhh) is a member of the hedgehog gene family that plays an important role in patterning brain, neural tube, somites, and eyes. To better understand the regulation of its tissue-specific expression, the activity of the twhh promoter was determined in zebrafish embryos by transient and transgenic expression analysis. Transient expression studies revealed that the 5.2-kb twhh promoter drove green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression in the notochord, floor plate, and branchial arches. Deletion analysis showed that distinct regions of the twhh promoter regulated the respective notochord or floor plate specific expression. To confirm the tissue specificity of the twhh promoter, transgenic zebrafish containing the twhh-GFP transgene were generated. GFP expression was analyzed in the F1, F2, and F3 generations of the transgenic embryos. The results confirmed the tissue-specific expression of the transgene in the notochord, floor plate, and branchial arches. In addition, GFP expression was also found in the pectoral fin buds, retina, and epithelial lining cells of the Kupffer's vesicle in the transgenic fish embryos. The expression pattern of the twhh-GFP transgene mimicked the expression of the endogenous twhh mRNAs in the floor plate, fin buds, branchial arches, retina, and epithelial lining cells of the Kupffer's vesicle. The expression in the notochord, however, did not mimic the pattern of the endogenous twhh expression. To determine whether no tail (ntl) or floating head (flh) mutants that have developmental defect in the notochord or the Kupffer's vesicle may affect the GFP expression in these regions, GFP expression was analyzed in ntl or flh transgenic embryos. No GFP expression could be detected in the midline region of the ntl transgenic embryos. However, in flh transgenic embryos, although GFP expression was affected in the midline region, its expression in the Kupffer's vesicle appeared normal. Together, these data indicated that the 5.2-kb twhh promoter contains regulatory elements for tissue-specific expression of twhh in the floor plate, pectoral fin bud, branchial arches, retina, and Kupffer's vesicle.</str>

      <str>Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumors primarily involving both ends of the axial skeleton that present as destructive bone lesions with a large soft tissue mass. Chordomas were previously believed to arise from notochordal remnants. However, recent studies suggest the possibility that chordomas arise from benign notochordal cell tumors. We present two cases of coccygeal incipient chordoma that strengthen the new hypothesis. The first case was an 83-year-old man who died of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The second case was a 79-year-old man who died of hepatocellular carcinoma. The coccygeal tumors were composed of intraosseous and extraosseous infiltrative lesions. The intraosseous lesions consisted of both benign notochordal cell tumor and incipient chordoma. The extraosseous lesions were consistent with incipient chordoma. In addition, two other small benign notochordal cell tumors were found at a different level in case 1. It is conceivable that pre-existing intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumors transform into incipient chordoma and then extend through the cortex into the surrounding soft tissue. The incidence of incipient chordoma appears much higher than expected because chordomas are rare tumors with an incidence of one case per 1 000 000 persons per year. We suspect that unknown factors transform incipient chordoma into classic chordoma.</str>

      <str>A case of spinal thoracic chordoma involving the T9 vertebra in a 70-year-old male patient, destroying the vertebral body and invading the vertebral canal with compression of the spinal cord, is presented. The patient was referred to our neurosurgical unit with a history of an irradiated metastatic adenocarcinoma to the thoracic vertebra, a diagnosis that was rendered 3 years earlier at another hospital on presentation. This misdiagnosis was likely due to the absolute rarity of thoracic vertebral chordomas (2%-3% of all chordomas), the higher frequency of metastatic deposits to the vertebrae from visceral cancers in the elderly, the limited amount of biopsy material available for histologic examination, and the epithelial phenotype of the tumor (keratin/EMA positive). The patient underwent second palliative surgery with subtotal piecemeal removal of the tumor bringing relief of the neurologic symptoms. The bulk of the tumor was represented by a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with adjacent areas of atypical chordoma. Small foci of conventional chordoma were also found. The previous histologic slides were also reviewed, which were consistent with the areas of atypical chordoma. Small targeted tissue fragments from areas of (atypical) chordoma and from sarcomatous areas were recovered for electron microscopy. The fine features of chordoma and focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation were found with the latter retrospectively supported by immunohistochemical detection of striated muscle markers. A final diagnosis of dedifferentiated chordoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation was finally established. Rhabdomyoblastic metaplasia is a novelty in dedifferentiated chordoma. The patient died after 5 months. Autopsy was not requested.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are an invaluable model for identifying subtle phenotypes as well as severe outcomes of perturbing gene function that may otherwise result in lethality. However,though ES cells of different origins are regarded as equally pluripotent,their in vitro differentiation potential varies, suggesting that their response to developmental signals is different. The R1 cell line is widely used for gene manipulation due to its good growth characteristics and highly efficient germline transmission. Hence, we analysed the expression of Notch, Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway genes during differentiation of R1 cells into early vascular lineages. Notch-, Wnt- and Shh-mediated signalling is important during embryonic development. Regulation of gene expression through these signalling molecules is a frequently used theme, resulting in context-dependent outcomes during development. Perturbing these pathways can result in severe and possibly lethal developmental phenotypes often due to primary cardiovascular defects. We report that during early spontaneous differentiation of R1 cells, Notch-1 and the Wnt target Brachyury are active whereas the Shh receptor is not detected. This expression pattern is similar to that seen in a mouse endothelial cell line. This temporal study of expression of genes representative of all three pathways in ES cell differentiation will aid in further analysis of cell signalling during vascular development.</str>

      <str>Beta-catenin, a component of the wnt-signal-transduction pathway, is essential for the formation of the dorsal axis in Xenopus laevis embryos. On the dorsal side of the embryo, beta-catenin is translocated into the nuclei via a process linked to cortical rotation. When cortical rotation is blocked by UV-irradiation, nuclear beta-catenin is found in the vegetal pole of the embryo. Here we show that overexpression of beta-catenin in animal cap explants, in the absence of mesoderm induction, is sufficient to activate the expression of genes with dorsalizing activity such as siamois (sia) and nodal-related 3 (nr3) but not goosecoid (gsc). In embryos ventralized by UV-treatment, the expression of the dorsal-specific genes sia, nr3 and gsc is induced at the vegetal pole after the Mid-Blastula-Transition (MBT). While nr3 and sia expression continues in these embryos until gastrula stages, gsc transcription cannot be maintained. We propose that the spatial separation of the expression domains of genes with dorsalizing activities and the prospective mesodermal region results in the loss of dorsal structures in the embryo. The role of cortical rotation is to generate an overlap of the region with dorsal axis-forming activity, indicated by nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, and the prospective mesoderm in the marginal zone to assure the correct positioning of the Spemann organizer.</str>

      <str>Tbx20 is a member of the T-box transcription factor family expressed in the forming hearts of vertebrate and invertebrate embryos. We report here analysis of Tbx20 expression during murine cardiac development and assessment of DNA-binding and transcriptional properties of Tbx20 isoforms. Tbx20 was expressed in myocardium and endocardium, including high levels in endocardial cushions. cDNAs generated by alternative splicing encode at least four Tbx20 isoforms, and Tbx20a uniquely carried strong transactivation and transrepression domains in its C terminus. Isoforms with an intact T-box bound specifically to DNA sites resembling the consensus brachyury half site, although with less avidity compared with the related factor, Tbx5. Tbx20 physically interacted with cardiac transcription factors Nkx2-5, GATA4, and GATA5, collaborating to synergistically activate cardiac gene expression. Among cardiac GATA factors, there was preferential synergy with GATA5, implicated in endocardial differentiation. In Xenopus embryos, enforced expression of Tbx20a, but not Tbx20b, led to induction of mesodermal and endodermal lineage markers as well as cell migration, indicating that the long Tbx20a isoform uniquely bears functional domains that can alter gene expression and developmental behaviour in an in vivo context. We propose that Tbx20 plays an integrated role in the ancient myogenic program of the heart, and has been additionally coopted during evolution of vertebrates for endocardial cushion development.</str>

      <str>Pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells derived from the blastocyst of the preimplantation embryo can be induced to differentiate in vitro along different cell lineages. However the molecular and cellular factors that signal and/or determine the expression of key genes, and the localisation of the encoded proteins, during the differentiation events are poorly understood. One common mechanism by which proteins can be targeted to specific regions of the cell is through the asymmetric localisation of mRNAs and Staufen, a double-stranded RNA binding protein, is known to play a direct role in mRNA transport and localisation. The aims of the present study were to describe the expression of Staufen in preimplantation embryos and mES cells and to use RNA interference (RNAi) to investigate the roles of Staufen1 in mES cell lineage differentiation. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that Staufen is present in the preimplantation mouse embryo, pluripotent mES cells and mES cells stimulated to differentiate into embryoid bodies, but the Staufen staining patterns did not support asymmetric distribution of the protein. Knockdown of Staufen1 gene expression in differentiating mES cells reduced the synthesis of lineage-specific markers including Brachyury, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), PAX-6, and Vasa. There was however no significant change in either the gene expression of Nanog and Oct4, or in the synthesis of SSEA-1, all of which are key markers of pluripotency. These data indicate that inhibition of Staufen1 gene expression by RNAi affects an early step in mES cell differentiation and suggest a key role for Staufen in the cell lineage differentiation of mES cells.</str>

      <str>During early zebrafish development the nodal signalling pathway patterns the embryo into three germ layers, in part by inducing the expression of no tail (ntl), which is essential for correct mesoderm formation. When nodal signalling is inhibited ntl fails to be expressed in the dorsal margin, but ventral ntl expression is unaffected. These observations indicate that ntl transcription is under both nodal-dependent and nodal-independent regulation. Consistent with these observations and with a role for ntl in mesoderm formation, some somites form within the tail region of embryos lacking nodal signalling. In an effort to understand how ntl is regulated and thus how mesoderm forms, we have mapped the elements responsible for nodal-dependent and nodal-independent expression of ntl in the margin of the embryo. Our work demonstrates that expression of ntl in the margin is the consequence of two separate enhancers, which act to mediate different mechanisms of mesoderm formation. One of these enhancers responds to nodal signalling, and the other to Wnt and BMP signalling. We demonstrate that the nodal-independent regulation of ntl is essential for tail formation. Misexpression of Wnt and BMP ligands can induce the formation of an ectopic tail, which contains somites, in embryos devoid of nodal signalling, and this tail formation is dependent on ntl function. Similarly, nodal-independent tail somite formation requires ntl. At later stages in development ntl is required for notochord formation, and our analysis has also led to the identification of the enhancer required for ntl expression in the developing notochord.</str>

      <str>Previously, we have shown that the ventralizing factor bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) can inhibit Xenopus neurogenesis. The erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 functions downstream of the BMP-4 signaling pathway and mediates BMP-4-induced erythropoiesis. We have found that similar to BMP-4, GATA-1b inhibits neuralization of Xenopus animal cap (AC) cells. The neural inhibition is not seen with GATA-1a, although both GATA-1a and GATA-1b RNAs are translated at the same efficiency and induce globin expression equally in AC cells. GATA-1b RNA injection into AC cells neither induces expression of Xbra (a general mesoderm marker) nor affects expression of XK81 (epidermal keratin) or BMP-4 and Xvent-1 (two ventral markers). These data suggest that GATA-1b retains the epidermal fate of the AC. Intact GATA-1b protein is required for both inhibition of neurogenesis and induction of globin expression. Our findings indicate that GATA-1b can function in ectoderm to specifically regulate neural inducing mechanisms, apparently related to the expression of chordin, a neuralizing gene. Furthermore, tadpole stage embryos injected with GATA-1b are devoid of all dorsoanterior structures including neural tissue. This report provides evidence that the two transcription factors, derived from a recent genome duplication, share a common biological activity (stimulation of erythropoiesis) while also exhibiting a distinct function (inhibition of neurogenesis).</str>

The vector pCMVT7R harboring T7RP driven by CMV promoter was introduced into zebrafish embryos and the germline transmitted transgenic individuals were screened out for subsequent RNAi application. The shRNA transcription vectors pT7shRNA were constructed and validated by in vivo transcription assay. When pT7shGFP vector was injected into the transgenic embryos stably expressing T7RP, gfp relative expression level showed a decrease of 68% by analysis of fluorescence real time RT-PCR. As a control, injection of chemical synthesized siRNA resulted in expression level of 40% lower than the control when the injection dose was as high as 2 microg/microl. More importantly, injection of pT7shNTL vector in zebrafish embryos expressing T7RP led to partial absence of endogenous ntl transcripts in 30% of the injected embryos when detected by whole mount in situ hybridization. Herein, the T7 transcription system could be used to drive the expression of shRNA in zebrafish embryos and result in gene knock down effect, suggesting a potential role for its application in RNAi studies in zebrafish embryos.</str>

      <str>snail family genes encode a transcription factor with specific zinc finger motifs. In vertebrates, they are expressed in the entire mesoderm in early embryogenesis and later in the paraxial mesoderm and the tail-bud, suggesting roles in specification and morphogenesis of the paraxial mesoderm. In the present study, a snail family gene Hrsna from a member of the chordates, an ascidian (Halocynthia roretzi), was cloned to obtain an insight into the origin of the mechanisms of mesoderm specification and body axis formation as observed in vertebrates. Expression of Hrsna during ascidian embryogenesis was found to be quite similar to that of vertebrate snail genes. First, before gastrulation, Hrsna was initially expressed in most precursors of mesodermal tissues including the notochord where As-T, the ascidian homolog of brachyury, was expressed. Hrsna expression persisted in the paraxial mesoderm, the mesenchyme and muscle, but not in the notochord precursors. Also, just as vertebrate snail family genes are expressed in the border of the neural plate that develops into dorsal neural tube and neural crest cells, so Hrsna expression was detected in the precursors of lateral and dorsal regions of the neural tube. However, Hrsna expression was not detected in the tip of the tail, unlike in vertebrate counterparts. In the light of the present findings, similarity and dissimilarity of mechanisms governing mesoderm specification and body axis formation between ascidians and vertebrates are discussed.</str>

      <str>Mouse embryos homozygous for the loop-tail (Lp) mutation fail to initiate neural tube closure at E8.5, leading to a severe malformation in which the neural tube remains open from midbrain to tail. During initiation of closure, the normal mouse neural plate bends sharply in the midline, at the site of the future floor plate. In contrast, Lp/Lp embryos exhibit a broad region of flat neural plate in the midline, displacing the sites of neuroepithelial bending to more lateral positions. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Netrin1 are expressed in abnormally broad domains in the ventral midline of the E9.5 Lp/Lp neural tube, suggesting over-abundant differentiation of the floor plate. The notochord is also abnormally broad in Lp/Lp embryos with enlarged domains of Shh and Brachyury expression. The paraxial mesoderm shows evidence of ventralisation, with increased expression of the sclerotomal marker Pax1, and diminished expression of the dermomyotomal marker Pax3. While the expression domain of Pax3 does not differ markedly from wild-type, there is a dorsal shift in the domain of Pax6 expression in the neural tube at caudal levels of Lp/Lp embryos. We suggest that the Lp mutation causes excessive differentiation of floor-plate and notochord, with over-production of Shh from these midline structures causing ventralisation of the paraxial mesoderm and, to a lesser extent, the neural tube. Comparison with other mouse mutants suggests that the enlarged floor plate may be responsible for the failure of neural tube closure in Lp/Lp embryos.</str>

      <str>The small heat-shock protein HSP25 is expressed in the heart early during development, and although multiple roles for HSP25 have been proposed, its specific role during development and differentiation is not known. P19 is an embryonal carcinoma cell line which can be induced to differentiate in vitro into either cardiomyocytes or neurons. We have used P19 to examine the role of HSP25 in differentiation. We found that HSP25 expression is strongly increased in P19 cardiomyocytes. Antisense HSP25 expression reduced the extent of cardiomyocyte differentiation and resulted in reduced expression of cardiac actin and the intermediate filament desmin and reduced level of cardiac mRNAs. Thus, HSP25 is necessary for differentiation of P19 into cardiomyocytes. In contrast, P19 neurons did not express HSP25 and antisense HSP25 expression had no effect on neuronal differentiation. The phosphorylation of HSP25 by the p38/SAPK2 pathway is known to be important for certain of its functions. Inhibition of this pathway by the specific inhibitor SB203580 prevented cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19 cells. In contrast, PD90589, which inhibits the ERK1/2 pathway, had no effect. Surprisingly, cardiogenesis was only sensitive to SB203580 during the first 2 days of differentiation, before HSP25 expression increases. In contrast to the effect of antisense HSP25, SB203580 reduced the level of expression of the mesodermal marker Brachyury-T during differentiation. Therefore, we propose that the p38 pathway acts on an essential target during early cardiogenesis.

      <str>Notochord and floor plate cells are sources of molecules that pattern tissues near the midline, including the spinal cord. Hypochord cells are also found at the midline of anamniote embryos and are important for aorta development. Delta-Notch signaling regulates midline patterning in the dorsal organizer by inhibiting notochord formation and promoting hypochord and possibly floor plate development, but the precise mechanisms by which this regulation occurs are unknown. We demonstrate here that floor plate and hypochord cells arise from distinct regions of the zebrafish shield. Blocking Notch signaling during gastrulation entirely prevented hypochord specification but only reduced the number of floor plate cells that developed compared to control embryos. In contrast, elevation of Notch signaling at the beginning of gastrulation caused expansion of hypochord at the expense of notochord, but floor plate was not affected. A cell proliferation assay revealed that Notch signaling maintains dividing floor plate progenitors. Together, our results indicate that Notch signaling regulates allocation of appropriate numbers of different midline cells by different mechanisms.</str>

      <str>The T-box genes Tbx4 and Tbx5 have been shown to have key functions in the specification of the identity of the vertebrate forelimb (Tbx5) and hindlimb (Tbx4). Here we show that in zebrafish, Tbx5 has an additional early function that precedes the formation of the limb bud itself. Functional knockdown of zebrafish tbx5 through the use of an antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a failure to initiate fin bud formation, leading to the complete loss of pectoral fins. The function of the tbx5 gene in the development of zebrafish forelimbs seems to involve the directed migration of individual lateral-plate mesodermal cells into the future limb-bud-producing region. The primary defect seen in the tbx5-knockdown phenotype is similar to the primary defects described in known T-box-gene mutants such as the spadetail mutant of zebrafish and the Brachyury mutant of the mouse, which both similarly exhibit an altered migration of mesodermal cells. A common function for many of the T-box genes might therefore be in mediating the proper migration and/or changes in adhesive properties of early embryonic cells.</str>

      <str>During development, cardiac commitment within the mesoderm requires endoderm-secreted factors. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells into the three germ layers in vitro recapitulates developmental processes and can be influenced by supplements added to culture medium. Hence, we investigated the effect of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and KnockOut serum replacement (SR) on germ layers specification and cardiac differentiation of H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESC) within embryoid bodies (EB). At the time of EB formation, FBS triggered an increased apoptosis. As assessed by quantitative PCR on 4-, 10-, and 20-day-old EB, FBS promoted a faster down-regulation of pluripotency marker Oct4 and an increased expression of endodermal (Sox17, alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) and mesodermal genes (Brachyury, CSX). While neuronal and hematopoietic differentiation occurred in both supplements, spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes were only observed in FBS. Action potential (AP) morphology of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes indicated that ventricular cells were present only after 2 months of culture. However, quantification of myosin light chain 2 ventricular (mlc2v)-positive areas revealed that mlc2v-expressing cardiomyocytes could be detected already after 2 weeks of differentiation, but not in all beating clusters. In conclusion, FBS enabled cardiac differentiation of hESC, likely in an endodermal-dependent pathway. Among cardiac cells, ventricular cardiomyocytes differentiated over time, but not as the predominant cardiac cell subtype.</str>

When the vegetal yolk mass was removed at the 1-cell stage, the embryos frequently exhibited typical ventralized phenotypes: no axial structures developed. The frequency of dorsal defects decreased when the operation was performed at later stages. Furthermore, the yolk cell obtained from the vegetal-removed embryos lost the ability to induce goosecoid in normal blastomeres while the normal yolk cell frequently did so in normal and vegetal-removed embryos.

      <str>The Wnt signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in vertebrate early development and morphogenesis. Duplin (axis duplication inhibitor) interacts with beta-catenin and prevents its binding to Tcf, thereby inhibiting downstream Wnt signaling. Here we show that Duplin is expressed predominantly from early- to mid-stage mouse embryogenesis, and we describe the generation of mice deficient in Duplin. Duplin(-/-) embryos manifest growth retardation from embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) and developmental arrest accompanied by massive apoptosis at E7.5. The mutant embryos develop into an egg cylinder but do not form a primitive streak or mesoderm. Expression of beta-catenin target genes, including those for T (brachyury), Axin2, and cyclin D1, was not increased in Duplin(-/-) embryos, suggesting that the developmental defect is not simply attributable to upregulation of Wnt signaling caused by the lack of this inhibitor. These results suggest that Duplin plays an indispensable role, likely by a mechanism independent of inhibition of Wnt signaling, in mouse embryonic growth and differentiation at an early developmental stage.</str>

      <str>When and how did the mechanisms controlling regional identity in the vertebrate neural tube arise during evolution? The anatomy and embryology of the major deuterostome phyla (echinoderms, hemichordates, chordates) suggest that a true neural tube with dorsoventral and mediolateral regionalization arose with the chordates. We suggest that this was intimately associated with the origin of the notochord; this leads us to propose a modification of Garstang's century-old scenario for origins of the chordate neural tube. Differences along the rostrocaudal axis are seen in all chordates, but became particularly pronounced with the origin of a brain in craniates. Recent molecular data are starting to give insights into these evolutionary transitions. Here we review how Hox gene expression patterns are giving clues to brain origins and we examine the role of molecular phylogenetics in these analyses. We also ask whether the molecular evolution of genes such as noggin, Brachyury, Sonic hedgehog, Wnt, and En may have played direct or permissive roles in the origins of the neural plate, notochord, floor plate, and brain.</str>

This histological result was coincident with our reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis that VEGF together with activin A promoted the expression of Xenopus N-CAM and Xenopus brachyury. This study suggests that VEGF has additional biological activities besides angiogenesis, and arises a different function that VEGF induces stroma cell migration or recruitment that are required for blood vessel formation.

Biomaterials can serve to control the spatial and temporal presentation of morphogenic molecules in order to direct stem cell fate decisions. Here we describe a microparticle (MP)-based approach to deliver growth factors within multicellular aggregates to direct pluripotent stem cell differentiation. Compared to conventional soluble delivery methods, gelatin MPs laden with BMP4 or noggin induced efficient gene expression of mesoderm and ectoderm lineages, respectively, despite using nearly 12-fold less total growth factor. BMP4-laden MPs increased the percentage of cells expressing GFP under the control of the Brachyury-T promoter as visualized by whole-mount confocal imaging and quantified by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the ability to localize MPs laden with different morphogens within a particular hemisphere of stem cell aggregates allowed for spatial control of differentiation within 3D cultures. Overall, localized delivery of growth factors within multicellular aggregates from microparticle delivery vehicles is an important step towards scalable differentiation technologies and the study of morphogen gradients in pluripotent stem cell differentiation. </str>

We previously discovered ET, a Tbx gene expressed in Xenopus embryos. We report here that ET is an ortholog of the human Tbx3 and that ET is a repressor of basal and activated transcription. Functional dissection of the ET protein reveals a novel transcription-repression domain highly conserved among ET, human TBX3, and TBX2.

Several molecules have been proposed as candidates for mesoderm-inducing signals, with activin a particularly strong candidate. However, it has not been possible to inhibit mesoderm formation in vivo by specifically blocking activin action. Follistatin is able to inhibit the action of activin but not that of the mature region of Vg1, a member of the transforming growth factor beta family. Follistatin therefore provides a useful tool for distinguishing between signalling by these two factors. We have overexpressed Xenopus follistatin mRNA and analysed the expression of several mesodermal markers.

This process has been demonstrated only recently through cell lineage analyses and determination of Sox2 activation mechanisms. The alternative developmental pathways depend on the activation of either transcription factor genes Sox2 (neural) or Tbx6 (mesodermal); the latter occurs in association with cell ingression through the primitive streak. Tbx6 mutant embryos develop ectopic neural tubes at the expense of the paraxial mesoderm, as Sox2 is expressed even after cell ingression. While producing alternative somatic cell populations, the axial stem cells proliferatively maintain themselves through a process dependent on the Brachyury-Wnt3a coregulatory loop, and even contribute to a fraction of later stem cells of the tail bud in the chordoneural hinge (CNH). Experimental evidence for the above processes is discussed, and unsolved problems indicated.</str>

      <str>How germ cells are specified in the embryos of animals has been a mystery for decades. Unlike most developmental processes, which are highly conserved, embryos specify germ cells in very different ways. Curiously, in mouse embryos germ cells are specified by extracellular signals; they are not autonomously specified by maternal germ cell determinants (germ plasm), as are the germ cells in most animal model systems. We have developed the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), a salamander, as an experimental system, because classic experiments have shown that the germ cells in this species are induced by extracellular signals in the absence of germ plasm. Here, we provide evidence that the germ cells in axolotls arise from naive mesoderm in response to simple inducing agents. In addition, by analysing the sequences of axolotl germ-cell-specific genes, we provide evidence that mice and urodele amphibians share a common mechanism of germ cell development that is ancestral to tetrapods.

      <str>The ancestral states of bilaterian development, and which living groups have conserved them the most, has been a controversial topic in biology for well over a hundred years. In recent years, the idea that gastrulation primitively proceeded via the formation of a slit-like blastopore that then evolved into either protostomy or deuterostomy has gained renewed attention and some molecular developmental support. One of the key pieces of evidence for this 'amphistomy' theory comes from the onychophorans, which form a clear ventral groove during gastrulation. The interpretation of this structure has, however, proved problematic. Based on expression patterns of forkhead (fkh), caudal (cad), brachyury (bra) and wingless (wg/Wnt1), we show that this groove does not correspond to the blastopore, even though both the mouth and anus later develop from it. Rather, the posterior pit appears to be the blastopore; the posterior of the groove later fuses with it to form the definitive anus. Onychophoran development therefore represents a case of 'concealed' deuterostomy. The new data from the onychophorans thus remove one of the key pieces of evidence for the amphistomy theory. Rather, in line with other recent results, it suggests that ancestral bilaterian development was deuterostomic. </str>

      <str>The sea anemone Nematostella vectensis has recently been established as a new model system for the understanding of the evolution of developmental processes. In particular, the evolutionary origin of gastrulation and its molecular regulation are the subject of intense investigation. However, while molecular data are rapidly accumulating, no detailed morphological data exist describing the process of gastrulation. Here, we carried out an ultrastructural study of different stages of gastrulation in Nematostella using transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscopy techniques. We show that presumptive endodermal cells undergo a change in cell shape, reminiscent of the bottle cells known from vertebrates and several invertebrates. Presumptive endodermal cells organize into a field, the pre-endodermal plate, which undergoes invagination. In parallel, the endodermal cells decrease their apical cell contacts but remain loosely attached to each other. Hence, during early gastrulation they display an incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). At a late stage of gastrulation, the cells eventually detach and fill the interior of the blastocoel as mesenchymal cells. This shows that gastrulation in Nematostella occurs by a combination of invagination and late immigration involving EMT. The comparison with molecular expression studies suggests that cells expressing snailA undergo EMT and become endodermal, whereas forkhead/brachyury expressing cells at the ectodermal margin of the blastopore retain their epithelial integrity throughout gastrulation.</str>

Although many recent advances in molecular biology have allowed limb regeneration and tissue repair in the axolotl to be investigated in increasing detail, the molecular toolkit for the study of this process has been limited. Here, we report that the CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system can efficiently create mutations at targeted sites within the axolotl genome. We identify individual animals treated with RNA-guided nucleases that have mutation frequencies close to 100% at targeted sites. We employ this technique to completely functionally ablate EGFP expression in transgenic animals and recapitulate developmental phenotypes produced by loss of the conserved gene brachyury. Thus, this advance allows a reverse genetic approach in the axolotl and will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into the mechanisms of salamanders' unique regenerative ability.</str>

      <str>Transcription factors have diverse roles during embryonic development, combinatorially controlling cellular states in a spatially and temporally defined manner. Resolving the dynamic transcriptional profiles that underlie these patterning processes is essential for understanding embryogenesis at the molecular level. Here we show how temporal, tissue-specific changes in embryonic transcription factor function can be discerned by integrating caged morpholino oligonucleotides with photoactivatable fluorophores, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and microarray technologies. As a proof of principle, we have dynamically profiled No tail a (Ntla)-dependent genes at different stages of axial mesoderm development in zebrafish, discovering discrete sets of transcripts that are coincident with either notochord cell fate commitment or differentiation. Our studies reveal new regulators of notochord development and the sequential activation of distinct transcriptomes within a cell lineage by a single transcriptional factor and demonstrate how optically controlled chemical tools can dissect developmental processes with spatiotemporal precision.</str>

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of MEF and hFF feeders on the cardiac differentiation. Two human embryonic and two induced pluripotent stem cell lines were cultured on MEF and hFF before cardiac differentiation. The expression of Brachyury T was higher in cell lines cultured on MEF, than if cultured on hFF, suggesting enhanced mesoderm formation. However, significant positive influence of MEF feeders on cardiac differentiation was only seen with one cell line. Further, the ability of hFF to maintain pluripotency of stem cells originally cultured on MEF was quite poor. In conclusion, the cells behaved differently whether cultured on hFF or MEF feeders. However, the influence of the feeder cells on differentiation was less than the difference observed between the cell lines.</str>

      <str>Non-cell-autonomous signals often play crucial roles in cell fate decisions during animal development. Reciprocal signaling between endoderm and mesoderm is vital for embryonic development, yet the key signals and mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that endodermal cells efficiently promote the emergence of mesodermal cells in the neighboring population through signals containing an essential short-range component. The endoderm-mesoderm interaction promoted precardiac mesoderm formation in mouse embryonic stem cells and involved endodermal production of fibronectin. In vivo, fibronectin deficiency resulted in a dramatic reduction of mesoderm accompanied by endodermal expansion in zebrafish embryos. This event was mediated by regulation of Wnt signaling in mesodermal cells through activation of integrin-β1. Our findings highlight the importance of the extracellular matrix in mediating short-range signals and reveal a novel function of endoderm, involving fibronectin and its downstream signaling cascades, in promoting the emergence of mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Retrospective clonal analysis in the mouse has demonstrated that the posterior spinal cord neurectoderm and paraxial mesoderm share a common bipotent progenitor. These neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are the source of new axial structures during embryonic rostrocaudal axis elongation and are marked by the simultaneous co-expression of the transcription factors T(Brachyury) (T(Bra)) and Sox2. NMP-like cells have recently been derived from pluripotent stem cells in vitro following combined stimulation of Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Under these conditions the majority of cultures consist of T(Bra)/Sox2 co-expressing cells after 48-72 hours of differentiation. Although the capacity of these cells to generate posterior neural and paraxial mesoderm derivatives has been demonstrated at the population level, it is unknown whether a single in vitro-derived NMP can give rise to both neural and mesodermal cells. Here we demonstrate that T(Bra) positive cells obtained from mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) after culture in NMP-inducing conditions can generate both neural and mesodermal clones. This finding suggests that, similar to their embryonic counterparts, in vitro-derived NMPs are truly bipotent and can thus be exploited as a model for studying the molecular basis of developmental cell fate decisions. </str>

Xenopus goosecoid is expressed on the dorsal side of the embryo before the dorsal lip is formed. Cells expressing goosecoid are fated to become pharyngeal endoderm, head mesoderm and notochord. Transplantation of goosecoid mRNA to the ventral side of Xenopus embryos by microinjection mimics the properties of Spemann's organizer, leading to the formation of twinned body axes, goosecoid is activated by dorsal inducers and not affected by ventral inducers. In the mouse, goosecoid is expressed in the anterior tip of the primitive streak. The availability of two early markers, goosecoid and Brachyury, opens the way for the comparative analysis of the vertebrate gastrula.

      <str>During human development, signals that govern lineage specification versus expansion of cells committed to a cell fate are poorly understood. We demonstrate that activation of canonical Wnt signaling by Wnt3a promotes proliferation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)--precursors already committed to the hematopoietic lineage. In contrast, noncanonical Wnt signals, activated by Wnt11, control exit from the pluripotent state and entry toward mesoderm specification. Unique to embryoid body (EB) formation of hESCs, Wnt11 induces development and arrangement of cells expressing Brachyury that coexpress E-cadherin and Frizzled-7 (Fzd7). Knockdown of Fzd7 expression blocks Wnt11-dependent specification. Our study reveals an unappreciated role for noncanonical Wnt signaling in hESC specification that involves development of unique mesoderm precursors via morphogenic organization within human EBs.</str>

      <str>We have constructed a genetic regulatory network (GRN) summarising the functional relationships between the transcription factors (TFs) and embryonic signals involved in Xenopus mesendoderm formation. It is supported by a relational database containing the experimental evidence and both are available in interactive form via the World Wide Web. This network highlights areas for further study and provides a framework for systematic interrogation of new data. Comparison with the equivalent network for the sea urchin identifies conserved features of the deuterostome ancestral pathway, including positive feedback loops, GATA factors, SoxB, Brachyury and a previously underemphasised role for beta-catenin. In contrast, some features central to one species have not yet been found in the other, for example, Krox and Otx in sea urchin, and Mix and Nodal in Xenopus. Such differences may represent evolved features or may eventually be resolved. For example, in Xenopus, Nodal-related genes are positively regulated by beta-catenin and at least one of them is repressed by Sox3, as is the uncharacterised early signal (ES) inducing endomesoderm in the sea urchin, suggesting that ES may be a Nodal-like TGF-beta. Wider comparisons of such networks will inform our understanding of developmental evolution.</str>

Syndromes with particular cardiac anomalies, illustrated by VSD (85%) or ASD (90%), frequently include limb defects. Positional correlations of anterior (preaxial/conotruncal), posterior (postaxial/atrial), or lateral (mirror hand/atrial isometry) heart/limb anomalies are consistent with the existence of a cardiomelic developmental field. Vertebrate comparisons suggest an early D-V limb-heart gradient, influenced by the neural crest, with distal limb segments (80% of syndromic defects) at its dorsal extreme. The proposed cardiomelic field relates the genetic heterogeneity of disorders such as Holt-Oram syndrome to a cascade of molecules, including the brachyury, sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein, retinoic acid receptor, and transforming growth factor-beta families.</str>

      <str>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) resemble embryonic stem cells and can differentiate into cell derivatives of all three germ layers. However, frequently the differentiation efficiency of iPS cells into some lineages is rather poor. Here, we found that fusion of iPS cells with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enhances iPS cell differentiation. Such iPS hybrids showed a prominent differentiation bias toward hematopoietic lineages but also toward other mesendodermal lineages. Additionally, during differentiation of iPS hybrids, expression of early mesendodermal markers-Brachyury (T), MIX1 Homeobox-Like Protein 1 (MIXL1), and Goosecoid (GSC)-appeared with faster kinetics than in parental iPS cells. Following iPS hybrid differentiation there was a prominent induction of NODAL and inhibition of NODAL signaling blunted mesendodermal differentiation. This indicates that NODAL signaling is critically involved in mesendodermal bias of iPS hybrid differentiation. In summary, we demonstrate that iPS cell fusion with HSCs prominently enhances iPS cell differentiation. </str>

We demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interacts with the carboxyl terminal domain of Mix.3. CDK9 is the catalytic subunit of the PTEF-b transcription elongation complex that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II to promote efficient elongation of nascent transcripts. Using whole embryo transcription reporter and animal pole explant assays, we show that Mix.3 activity is regulated by CDK9/cyclin complexes. Co-expression of cyclin T2 and cyclin K had different effects on Mix.3 transcriptional activity and endoderm induction. Our data suggest that binding of CDK9, and the recruitment of different cyclin partners, can modulate the endoderm-inducing activity of Mix.3 during embryonic development.

We screened a panel of 44 cytokines/signaling molecules for their ability to enhance Nkx2.5(+) cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) formation during in vitro embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Treatment of murine ESCs with insulin or insulin-like growth factors (IGF1/2) during early differentiation increased mesodermal cell proliferation and, consequently, CPC formation. Furthermore, we show that downstream mediators of IGF signaling (e.g., phospho-Akt and mTOR) are required for this effect. These data support a novel role for IGF family ligands to expand the developing mesoderm and promote cardiac differentiation.

      <str>As a group closely related to chordates, hemichordate acorn worms are in a key phylogenic position for addressing hypotheses of chordate origins. The stomochord of acorn worms is an anterior outgrowth of the pharynx endoderm into the proboscis. In 1886 Bateson proposed homology of this organ to the chordate notochord, crowning this animal group "hemichordates." Although this proposal has been debated for over a century, the question still remains unresolved. Here we review recent progress related to this question. First, the developmental mode of the stomochord completely differs from that of the notochord. Second, comparison of expression profiles of genes including Brachyury, a key regulator of notochord formation in chordates, does not support the stomochord/notochord homology. Third, FoxE that is expressed in the stomochord-forming region in acorn worm juveniles is expressed in the club-shaped gland and in the endostyle of amphioxus, in the endostyle of ascidians, and in the thyroid gland of vertebrates. Based on these findings, together with the anterior endodermal location of the stomochord, we propose that the stomochord has evolutionary relatedness to chordate organs deriving from the anterior pharynx rather than to the notochord.</str>

The characterization of distinct immunohistochemical expression profiles and the identification of molecular genetic alterations associated with different tumor entities have significantly advanced this field. The new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the nervous system lists 15 histopathological variants of meningioma. Of clinical importance are those entities that carry an increased risk of recurrence and a poor prognosis, i.e., the atypical meningioma (WHO grade II), clear-cell meningioma (WHO grade II), chordoid meningioma (WHO grade II), rhabdoid meningioma (WHO grade III), papillary meningioma (WHO grade III), and anaplastic meningioma (WHO grade III). Diagnostic criteria for atypical and anaplastic meningioma variants have now been stringently defined. The differential diagnosis of meningiomas includes hemangiopericytoma, hemangioblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, sarcomas, and chordoid neoplasms. Recent data highlight the importance of distinguishing chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base since chondrosarcomas show a significantly better clinical outcome. Among the less common, aggressive tumor entities in this anatomical region, infiltrating pituitary adenoma/pituitary carcinoma, superficial malignant gliomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, various sarcomas, and malignant lymphoma must be considered.

Morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) are very common tools used in several model organisms with which it is possible to block gene expression. Recently developed photo-activated MOs allow control over the onset of MO activity. However, deactivation of photo-cleavable MO activity has remained elusive. Here, we describe photo-cleavable MOs with which it is possible to activate or de-activate MO function by UV exposure in a temporal and spatial manner. We show, using several different genes as examples, that it is possible to turn gene expression on or off both in the entire zebrafish embryo and in single cells. We use these tools to demonstrate the sufficiency of no tail expression as late as tailbud stage to drive medial precursor cells towards the notochord cell fate. As a broader approach for the use of photo-cleavable MOs, we show temporal control over gal4 function, which has many potential applications in multiple transgenic lines. We demonstrate temporal manipulation of Gal4 transgene expression in only primary motoneurons and not secondary motoneurons, heretofore impossible with conventional transgenic approaches. In another example, we follow and analyze neural crest cells that regained sox10 function after deactivation of a photo-cleavable sox10-MO at different time points.

      <str>Cellular interactions with laminin are important for numerous morphogenetic events. In Xenopus, the first of these is neurulation. The integrin alpha6 subunit mediates an attachment of the cells of the neural plate to the underlying basal lamina. A disruption of this interaction results in embryos that fail to neurulate (T. E. Lallier et al., 1996, Development 122, 2539-2554). Here we provide evidence supporting the specificity of this phenomenon and characterize developmental events as either disrupted or unaffected by a perturbation of alpha6 integrin expression. First, reduction of alpha6 integrin expression does not halt mitotic division throughout the embryo, indicating that the neural defects observed are not simply a global perturbation of all developmental processes. Second, a gene associated with dorsal mesoderm formation, brachyury, is expressed normally in alpha6 integrin-perturbed embryos. Third, the expression of BMP4, noggin, chordin, and follistatin, all of which are critical for neural induction, are at near normal levels. In addition, several genes expressed shortly after neural induction (N-CAM, nrp1, and Xanf1) are not perturbed in nonneurulating embryos. Interestingly, expression of one neural-specific gene (synaptobrevin), which is normally detectable late in neurulation, is abolished in these alpha6 integrin-perturbed embryos. Furthermore, the spatial expression of several transcripts is expanded in alpha6 integrin-perturbed embryos (orthodenticle and engrailed). Taken together, these data indicate that while alpha6 integrin-mediated interactions with laminin are required for neurulation, they are not required for the initial processes of neural induction. However, these cell-extracellular matrix interactions appear to be important in later inductive events and rostrocaudal patterning of the neural tube.</str>

The Ednrb(s-1Acrg) deletion results in recessive embryonic lethality and mutant embryos exhibit a truncated posterior body axis. The primitive streak and node become disfigured, consistent with evidence that cell migration is impaired in newly formed mesoderm. Additional defects related to mesoderm development include notochord degeneration, somite malformations, and abnormal vascular development. Arrested heart looping morphogenesis and a randomized direction of embryonic turning indicate that left-right development is also perturbed. The expression of nodal and leftb, Tgf-beta-related genes involved in a left-determinant signaling pathway, is variably lost in the left lateral plate mesoderm. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that Fgf8 and Brachyury (T) are required for normal mesoderm and left-right development and the asymmetric expression of nodal and leftb. Fgf8 expression in nascent mesoderm exiting the primitive streak is dramatically reduced in mutant embryos, and diminished T expression accompanies the progressive loss of paraxial, lateral, and primitive streak mesoderm. In contrast, axial mesoderm persists and T and nodal appear to be appropriately expressed in their specific domains in the node and notochord. We propose that this mutation disrupts a morphogenetic pathway, likely involving FGF signaling, important for the development of streak-derived posterior mesoderm and lateral morphogenesis.</str>

We used real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry to examine gene expression profiles of mSSCs and ESCs during in vitro vascular differentiation. Both mSSCs and ESCs exhibited substantial increase in the expression of mesodermal markers, such as Brachyury, Flk1, Mesp1, Nkx2.5, and Islet1, and a decrease in the expression of pluripotency markers, such as Oct3/4 and Nanog during the early stage of differentiation. The mRNA levels of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and CD31 gradually increased in both differentiated mSSCs and ESCs. VE-cadherin- or CD31-positive cells formed sprouting branch-like structures, as observed during embryonic vascular development. At the same time, vascular smooth muscle cell-specific markers, such as myocardin and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), were also highly expressed in differentiated mSSCs and ESCs. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the differentiated cells expressed both α-SMA and SM22-α proteins, and exhibited the intracellular fibril structure typical of smooth muscle cells. Overall, our findings showed that mSSCs have similar vascular differentiation abilities to those of ESCs, suggesting that mSSCs may be an alternative source of autologous pluripotent stem cells for vascular regeneration.</str>

      <str>Exostosin 1 (EXT1) is a glycosyltransferase that contributes to the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Loss of ext1 function leads to the human genetic disorder hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) and inhibits development in mouse, zebrafish and Drosophila. In Xenopus, loss of maternal EXT1 leads to impaired wnt11 signaling, resulting in a loss of dorsal embryonic development (Tao et al., 2005), but the functions of zygotic ext1 have not been elucidated. In this study, morpholino oligonucleotides were used to generate a zygotic partial loss of function for ext1, in order to evaluate the requirements for ext1 function in gastrulation and paracrine signaling. Transcriptional profiling was carried out by microarray. Validation and subsequent analyses of gene expression were performed using Q-RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Western blots were used to assess paracrine signaling pathway activity. Introduction of ext1 MO led to gastrulation defects, which were partially rescued by co-injection of ext1 mRNA. Microarray-based comparisons of gene expression in control vs. Ext1 MO embryos identified several developmentally significant genes that are dependent upon Ext1 function, including brachyury (Xbra). In addition, decreased Ext1 was shown to reduce the level of Wnt8 and BMP4 signaling and disrupt ventral-specific gene expression. Ext1 function is required for maintenance of normal levels of BMP and wnt, as well as their target genes. In addition, expression of xbra and the establishment of ventral mesoderm depend upon normal levels of Ext1. These findings suggest that ext1-dependent synthesis of HSPG is critical for wnt and BMP signaling, mesodermal identity, and ventral pattern. </str>

      <str>The aim of this study was to identify new compounds that induce cardiomyocyte differentiation of stem cells through cell-based screening and investigate lineage specificity and mechanisms in vitro.</str>
      <str>Embryoid bodies (EBs) formed from TC-1/KH2 mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carrying the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter were treated with test compounds. The number of cardiomyocyte-like (EGFP-expressing) cells in EBs was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cardiomyocyte differentiation was further confirmed using lineage-specific biochemical assays and by investigating the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific and "stemness"-associated genes. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling activity was measured in A549 cells using a reporter-gene assay.</str>
      <str>A β-carboline compound, designated CW108F, increased the number of mouse ESCs expressing α-MHC promoter-driven EGFP and the proportion of beating EBs. CW108F also increased expression of MHC in P19 stem cells, but did not induce osteogenesis of MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting lineage-specific activity toward cardiomyocytes. CW108F upregulated expression of cardiac-specific GATA-4 and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) genes in TC-1/KH2 cells, but downregulated expression of the stemness genes, Oct-4 and brachyury. CW108F inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity, an effect that might contribute to its cardiomyogenesis-promoting activity.</str>
      <str>The results of this study suggest that the novel β-carboline, CW108F, promotes the differentiation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes and may be useful for investigating molecular pathways of cardiomyogenesis and generating cardiomyocytes from ESCs.</str>

      <str>Endogenous signals capable of inducing neuroectodermal differentiation are expressed by differentiating P19 EC cells in vitro. The present study demonstrates that at least two discrete signals are required. One is expressed by isolated primitive streak mesoderm-like cell lines and has the capacity to induce the expression of Pax-3 but, alone, induces neural differentiation inefficiently. The second signal is not expressed by the primitive streak mesoderm-like cell line but is present in conditioned media from differentiating P19 EC cells following DMSO treatment. This signal does not induce either Pax-3 expression or morphological differentiation and does not commit stem cells to a neuroectodermal fate. Rather, it acts synergistically with the signal derived from the primitive streak mesoderm-like cells to increase the efficiency with which stem cells respond initially by Pax-3 expression and subsequently by differentiation towards neural lineages. The activity of this second signal can be replaced by forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine suggesting that its effects are transduced by a cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathway.</str>

      <str>Alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells have important functions including the production of surfactant and regeneration of lost alveolar type I epithelial cells. The ability of in vitro production of AT2 cells would offer new therapeutic options in treating pulmonary injuries and disorders including genetically based surfactant deficiencies. Aiming at the generation of AT2-like cells, the differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) toward mesendodermal progenitors (MEPs) was optimized using a "Brachyury-eGFP-knock in" mESC line. eGFP expression demonstrated generation of up to 65% MEPs at day 4 after formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) under serum-free conditions. Plated EBs were further differentiated into AT2-like cells for a total of 25 days in serum-free media resulting in the expression of endodermal marker genes (FoxA2, Sox17, TTR, TTF-1) and of markers for distal lung epithelium (surfactant proteins (SP-) A, B, C, and D, CCSP, aquaporin 5). Notably, expression of SP-C as the only known AT2 cell specific marker could be detected after serum-induction as well as under serum-free conditions. Cytoplasmic localization of SP-C was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The presence of AT2-like cells was confirmed by electron microscopy providing evidence for polarized cells with apical microvilli and lamellar body-like structures. Our results demonstrate the differentiation of AT2-like cells from mESCs after serum-induction and under serum-free conditions. The established serum-free differentiation protocol will facilitate the identification of key differentiation factors leading to a more specific and effective generation of AT2-like cells from ESCs.</str>

      <str>The T-box genes encode a novel family of transcriptional factors that seem to play crucial roles in various processes of animal development, in particular, mesoderm formation of chordate embryos. The ascidian egg has been regarded as a typical mosaic egg, in which several types of embryonic cells are specified autonomously dependent on prelocalized maternal factors or determinants. In the present study, we investigated a possible role of a maternal T-box gene (As-mT) of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. A cDNA clone we obtained predicted As-mT protein of 891 amino acids with a distinct T-domain, which was divergent from those of other T-box genes. Expression of As-mT was exclusively maternal. Although the transcript became barely detectable by the gastrula stage, no zygotic expression was evident during embryogenesis. The maternal transcript was distributed rather evenly within eggs and early embryos without any special localization. Injection of synthetic As-mT mRNA into fertilized eggs induced retardation of embryogenesis. Although cleavage occurred normally, the initiation of gastrulation was delayed, and delay in the morphogenesis resulted in dumpy larvae. Expression of a muscle-specific actin gene, a notochord-specific Brachyury gene, and an epidermis-specific gene was not detected at the early gastrula stage, all of the three genes being expressed in normal embryos at that stage. However, the expression of these genes as well as a mesenchyme-specific gene and histochemical activity of endoderm-specific alkaline phosphatase were evident by the mid-tailbud stage.</str>

      <str>Microgravity has a profound effect on cardiovascular function, however, little is known about the impact of microgravity on progenitors that reside within the heart. We investigated the effect of simulated microgravity exposure on progenitors isolated from the neonatal and adult human heart by quantifying changes in functional parameters, gene expression and protein levels after 6-7 days of 2D clinorotation. Utilization of neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors in ground-based studies has provided novel insight into how microgravity may affect cells differently depending on age. Simulated microgravity exposure did not impact AKT or ERK phosphorylation levels and did not influence cell migration, but elevated transcripts for paracrine factors were identified in neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors. Age-dependent responses surfaced when comparing the impact of microgravity on differentiation. Endothelial cell tube formation was unchanged or increased in progenitors from adults whereas neonatal cardiovascular progenitors showed a decline in tube formation (p&lt;0.05). Von Willebrand Factor, an endothelial differentiation marker, and MLC2v and Troponin T, markers for cardiomyogenic differentiation, were elevated in expression in adult progenitors after simulated microgravity. DNA repair genes and telomerase reverse transcriptase which are highly expressed in early stem cells were increased in expression in neonatal but not adult cardiac progenitors after growth under simulated microgravity conditions. Neonatal cardiac progenitors demonstrated higher levels of MESP1, OCT4, and brachyury, markers for early stem cells. MicroRNA profiling was used to further investigate the impact of simulated microgravity on cardiovascular progenitors. Fifteen microRNAs were significantly altered in expression, including microRNAs-99a and 100 (which play a critical role in cell dedifferentiation). These microRNAs were unchanged in adult cardiac progenitors. The effect of exposure to simulated microgravity in cardiovascular progenitors is age-dependent. Adult cardiac progenitors showed elevated expression of markers for endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation whereas neonatal progenitors acquired characteristics of dedifferentiating cells. </str>

      <str>The high mobility group (HMG) proteins constitute a superfamily of nuclear proteins that regulate the expression of a wide range of genes through architectural remodeling of the chromatin structure, and the formation of multiple protein complexes on promoter/enhancer regions, but their function in germ layer specification during early development is not clear. Here we show that hmgb genes regulate mesoderm formation and dorsoventral patterning both in zebrafish and Xenopus early embryos. Overexpression of hmgb3 blocks the expression of the pan-mesoderm gene no tail/Xbra and other ventrolateral mesoderm genes, and results in embryos with shortened anteroposterior axis, while overexpression of hmgb3EnR, which contains the engrailed repressor domain, most potently repressed no tail expression and mesoderm formation. However, hmgb3VP16, which contains the transcriptional activation domain of VP16, had an opposite effect, indicating that hmgb3 may function as a repressor during mesoderm induction and patterning. In addition, we show that hmgb3 inhibits target gene expression downstream of mesoderm-inducing factors. Furthermore, using reporter gene assays in Xenopus whole embryos, we show that hmgb3 differentially regulates the activation of various mesendoderm reporter genes. In particular, it up-regulates the goosecoid, but inhibits the Xbra reporter gene activation. Therefore, our results suggest that hmgb genes may function to fine-tune the specification and/or dorsoventral patterning of mesoderm during zebrafish and Xenopus development.</str>

      <str>While nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), a transcription factor implicated in osmotic stress response, is suggested to be involved in other processes such as migration and proliferation, its role in cardiomyogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of NFAT5 in cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells, and observed that it was abundantly expressed in undifferentiated P19CL6 cells, and its protein expression was significantly downregulated by enhanced proteasomal degradation during DMSO-induced cardiomyogenesis. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of NFAT5 markedly attenuated cardiomyogenesis, which was associated with the inhibition of mesodermal differentiation. TOPflash reporter assay revealed that the transcriptional activity of canonical Wnt signaling was activated prior to mesodermal differentiation, and this activation was markedly attenuated by NFAT5 inhibition. Pharmacological activation of canonical Wnt signaling by [2'Z, 3'E]-6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO) restored Brachyury expression in NFAT5DN-expressing cells. Inhibition of NFAT5 markedly attenuated Wnt3 and Wnt3a induction. Expression of Dkk1 and Cerberus1, which are secreted Wnt antagonists, was also inhibited by NFAT5 inhibition. Thus, endogenous NFAT5 regulates the coordinated expression of Wnt ligands and antagonists, which are essential for cardiomyogenesis through the canonical Wnt pathway. These results demonstrated a novel role of NFAT5 in cardiac differentiation of stem cells.</str>

      <str>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising tool for regenerative medicine. Use of iPSC lines for future hematotherapy will require examination of their hematopoietic potential. Adult skin fibroblast somatic cells constitute a source of iPSCs that can be accessed clinically without ethical issues. Here, we used different methods to compare mesodermal and hematopoietic potential by embryoid body formation of five iPSC lines established from adult mouse tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs). We observed variation in proliferation and in expression of genes (Brachyury, Tbx1, Gata1, Klf1, Csf1r) and proteins (Flk1, Ter119 and CD45) among TTF-derived lines. 256H18 iPSCs showed highest proliferation and most efficient differentiation into mesodermal and hematopoietic cells, while expression levels of the pluripotency genes Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and Nanog were lowest among lines analyzed. By contrast, the 212B2 line, transduced with c-Myc, showed lowest proliferation and differentiation potential, although expression levels of Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4 were highest. Overall, we find that mesodermal and hematopoietic potential varies among iPSCs from an identical tissue source and that c-Myc expression likely underlies these differences.</str>

      <str>In vertebrate embryos, the class I subtype forkhead domain gene HNF-3 is essential for the formation of the endoderm, notochord and overlying ventral neural tube. In ascidian embryos, Brachyury is involved in the formation of the notochord. Although the results of previous studies imply a role of HNF-3 in notochord differentiation in ascidian embryos, no experiments have been carried out to address this issue directly. Therefore the present study examined the developmental role of HNF-3 in ascidian notochord differentiation. When embryos were injected with a low dose of HNF-3 mRNA, their tails were shortened and when embryos were injected with a high dose of HNF-3 mRNA, which was enough to inhibit differentiation of epidermis and muscle, no obvious ectopic differentiation of endoderm or notochord cells was observed. However, co-injection of HNF-3 mRNA along with Brachyury mRNA resulted in ectopic differentiation of notochord cells in the animal hemisphere, suggesting that HNF-3 acts synergistically with Brachyury in ascidian notochord differentiation. Notochord differentiation of the A-line precursor cells depends on inducing signal(s) from endodermal cells, which can be mimicked by bFGF treatment. Treatment of notochord precursor cells isolated from the 32-cell stage embryoswith bFGF resulted in upregulation of both the HNF-3 and Brachyury genes.</str>

      <str>The T-box transcription factor T-bet has been reported to augment the activity of IFN-gamma reporter constructs and to be required for CD4(+), but not CD8(+), T cell production for IFN-gamma. Despite these observations, the precise sequence targets of T-bet within the IFN-gamma locus have not been identified and the nature of T-bet's role in selectively augmenting IFN-gamma production in CD4(+) T cells has not been elucidated. As an initial step in this process, we examined the basis of T-bet-dependent augmentation of IFN-gamma reporter constructs to identify specific targets of this factor within the IFN-gamma locus. Deletion of previously proposed TDB and TRU elements left T-bet-induced IFN-gamma reporter activity unchanged, suggesting the existence of additional T-bet-responsive elements. We identified several additional monomeric Brachyury consensus elements within the proximal IFN-gamma promoter that operate cooperatively to increase both constitutive and stimulated promoter activity. The most proximal of these Brachyury elements is most significant quantitatively in mediating T-bet-dependent promoter augmentation. Mutation of this with any of the other Brachyury elements leads to a near eradication of T-bet-dependent promoter activation. The identification of these individual monomeric Brachyury-binding sites within the IFN-gamma locus should facilitate the in vivo analysis of the function of T-bet in the lineage- and background-dependent requirement for T-bet in IFN-gamma gene regulation.</str>

It is unknown whether similar epigenetic events occur in embryonic stem cells (ESC) exposed to NO and how this treatment could influence ESC therapeutic potential during tissue regeneration.This study reports that the NO-dependent class IIa HDACs subcellular localization and activity decreases the global acetylation level of H3 histones in ESC and that this phenomenon is associated with the inhibition of Oct4, Nanog, and KLF4 expression. Further, a NO-induced formation of macromolecular complexes including HDAC3, 4, 7, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) have been detected. These processes correlated with the expression of the mesodermal-specific protein brachyury (Bry) and the appearance of several vascular and skeletal muscle differentiation markers. These events were abolished by the class IIa-specific inhibitor MC1568 and by HDAC4 or HDAC7 short interfering RNA (siRNA). The ability of NO to induce mesodermic/cardiovascular gene expression prompted us to evaluate the regenerative potential of these cells in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. We found that NO-treated ESCs injected into the cardiac left ventricle selectively localized in the ischemic hindlimb and contributed to the regeneration of muscular and vascular structures.

      <str>We have developed a paracrine signaling assay capable of mimicking inductive events in the early vertebrate embryo. RNA encoding one or more secreted proteins is microinjected into a Xenopus laevis oocyte. After a brief incubation to allow translation, a piece of embryonic tissue competent to respond to the signaling protein is grafted onto the oocyte. The secreted protein's effect on the grafted explant is then scored by assaying expression of tissue-specific markers. Explants of ectodermal tissue from blastula or gastrula stage embryos were grafted onto oocytes that had been injected with RNA encoding activin or noggin. We found that the paracrine assay faithfully reconstitutes mesoderm induction by activin and neural induction by noggin. Blastula-stage explants grafted onto activin-expressing oocytes expressed the mesodermal marker genes brachyury, goosecoid, and muscle actin. Gastrula-stage explants grafted onto noggin-expressing oocytes expressed neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and formed cement gland. By injecting pools of RNA synthesized from a cDNA expression library into the oocyte, we also used the assay to screen for secreted neural-inducing proteins. We assayed 20,000 independent transformants of a library constructed from LiCl-dorsalized Xenopus laevis embryos, and we identified two cDNAs that induced neural tissue in ectodermal explants from gastrula-stage embryos.

      <str>A role for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in axial patterning has been demonstrated in animals as basal as cnidarians, while roles in axial patterning for retinoic acid (RA) probably evolved in the deuterostomes and may be chordate-specific. In vertebrates, these two pathways interact both directly and indirectly. To investigate the evolutionary origins of interactions between these two pathways, we manipulated Wnt/beta-catenin and RA signaling in the basal chordate amphioxus during the gastrula stage, which is the RA-sensitive period for anterior/posterior (A/P) patterning. The results show that Wnt/beta-catenin and RA signaling have distinctly different roles in patterning the A/P axis of the amphioxus gastrula. Wnt/beta-catenin specifies the identity of the ends of the embryo (high Wnt = posterior; low Wnt = anterior) but not intervening positions. Thus, upregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling induces ectopic expression of posterior markers at the anterior tip of the embryo. In contrast, RA specifies position along the A/P axis, but not the identity of the ends of the embryo-increased RA signaling strongly affects the domains of Hox expression along the A/P axis but has little or no effect on the expression of either anterior or posterior markers. Although the two pathways may both influence such things as specification of neuronal identity, interactions between them in A/P patterning appear to be minimal.</str>

      <str>A prediction from the set-aside theory of bilaterian origins is that pattern formation processes such as those controlled by the Hox cluster genes are required specifically for adult body plan formation. This prediction can be tested in animals that use maximal indirect development, in which the embryonic formation of the larva and the postembryonic formation of the adult body plan are temporally and spatially distinct. To this end, we quantitatively measured the amount of transcripts for five Hox genes in embryos of a lophotrochozoan, the polychaete annelid Chaetopterus sp. The polychaete Hox complex is shown not to be expressed during embryogenesis, but transcripts of all measured Hox complex genes are detected at significant levels during the initial stages of adult body plan formation. Temporal colinearity in the sequence of their activation is observed, so that activation follows the 3'-5' arrangement of the genes. Moreover, Hox gene expression is spatially localized to the region of teloblastic set-aside cells of the later-stage embryos. This study shows that an indirectly developing lophotrochozoan shares with an indirectly developing deuterostome, the sea urchin, a common mode of Hox complex utilization: construction of the larva, whether a trochophore or dipleurula, does not involve Hox cluster expression, but in both forms the complex is expressed in the set-aside cells from which the adult body plan derives.</str>

Although a conserved Ras/MAPK pathway is known to be involved in this signaling, the target transcription factor of this signaling cascade has remained unknown. We have isolated HrEts, an ascidian homolog of vertebrate Ets1 and Ets2, to elucidate the transcription factor involved in the FGF signaling pathway in embryos of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. Maternal mRNA of HrEts was detected throughout the entire egg cytoplasm and early embryos. Its zygotic expression started in several tissues, including the notochord and neural plate. Overexpression of HrEts mRNA did not affect the general organization of the tadpoles, but resulted in formation of excess sensory pigment cells. In contrast, suppression of HrEts function by morpholino antisense oligonucleotide resulted in severe abnormalities, similar to those of embryos in which the FGF signaling pathway was inhibited. Notochord-specific Brachyury expression at cleavage stage and notochord differentiation at the tailbud stage were abrogated. Formation of mesenchyme cells was also suppressed, and the mesenchyme precursors assumed muscle fate. In addition, expression of Otx in brain-lineage blastomeres was specifically suppressed. These results suggest that an Ets transcription factor, HrEts, is involved in signal transduction of FGF commonly in notochord, mesenchyme, and brain induction in ascidian embryos.</str>

      <str>Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells offer a unique possibility to monitor the differentiation of several cell types in vitro. This study attempts to identify marker genes during in vitro cell differentiation of murine ES cells and allow a prediction of chemical effects on cell differentiation of specific target tissues. The study focused on the expression pattern of key genes involved in cardiomyocyte and osteoblast differentiation: Oct-4, Brachyury, Nkx2.5, alpha myosin heavy chain, Cbfa1, and Osteocalcin.</str>
      <str>Methotrexate was selected due to its well-characterized teratogenic effects. Several in vivo studies have demonstrated the specific interactions of methotrexate with bone formation whereas the cardiovascular system is not specifically affected after exposure to low concentration. The capability of murine ES cells to differentiate in vitro into cardiomyocytes as well as into osteoblasts have been used to demonstrate the target cell specificity in vitro, at non-cytotoxic concentration.</str>
      <str>Exposure of differentiating ES cells did not result in any gene profile modification of the selected cardiomyocyte specific genes, whereas the expression of osteoblast specific key genes, Cbfa1 and Osteocalcin, decreased. At the latter stages of skeletal differentiation we observed a 30% decrease in gene expression for Cbfa1 and a 60% decrease for Osteocalcin, with reference to the control. Early marker genes for undifferentiated cells and mesodermal cells were not modified after methotrexate treatment.</str>

      <str>The germ cell nuclear factor of Xenopus laevis (xGCNF; NR6A1) is a nuclear orphan receptor that is predominantly expressed during neurula and late tailbud stages. As a strategy to analyze the role of xGCNF in embryogenesis, we have induced a gain of function by overexpression of full-length (fl) GCNF and a functional inhibition by a dominant-negative (dn) GCNF. Early events of embryogenesis including gastrulation and neurulation were not affected and the expression of several early mesodermal markers was normal. Yet specific defects were observed upon organogenesis. Ectopic posterior overexpression of the full-length xGCNF caused posterior defects and disturbed somite formation. In contrast, expression of dnGCNF interfered with differentiation of the neural tube and affected the differentiation of anterior structures, including the cement gland and the eyes. Embryos affected by dnGCNF were rescued by coexpression of flGCNF. After expression of dnGCNF, mRNA encoding the the retinoic acid receptor xRAR gamma 2 was selectively suppressed anteriorly. From the distinct phenotypes obtained, we conclude that GCNF has an essential function in anteroposterior differentiation during organogenesis.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate in vitro to produce the endothelial and hematopoietic precursor, the hemangioblasts, which are derived from the mesoderm germ layer. Differentiation of Bry(GFP/+) ES cell to hemangioblasts can be followed by the expression of the Bry(GFP/+) and Flk1 genes. Proteomic and transcriptomic changes during this differentiation process were analyzed to identify mechanisms for phenotypic change during early differentiation. Three populations of differentiating Bry(GFP) ES cells were obtained by flow cytometric sorting, GFP-Flk1- (epiblast), GFP+Flk1- (mesoderm), and GFP+Flk1+ (hemangioblast). Microarray analyses and relative quantification two-dimensional LCLC-MS/MS on nuclear extracts were performed. We identified and quantified 2389 proteins, 1057 of which were associated to their microarray probe set. These included a variety of low abundance transcription factors, e.g. UTF1, Sox2, Oct4, and E2F4, demonstrating a high level of proteomic penetrance. When paired comparisons of changes in the mRNA and protein expression levels were performed low levels of correlation were found. A strong correlation between isobaric tag-derived relative quantification and Western blot analysis was found for a number of nuclear proteins. Pathway and ontology analysis identified proteins known to be involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation, and proteins with no described function in early ES cell development were also shown to change markedly at the proteome level only. ES cell development is regulated at the mRNA and protein level.</str>

      <str>Members of the T-box gene family play important and diverse roles in development and disease. Here, we study the functional specificities of the Xenopus T-domain proteins Xbra and VegT, which differ in their abilities to induce gene expression in prospective ectodermal tissue. In particular, VegT induces strong expression of goosecoid whereas Xbra cannot. Our results indicate that Xbra is unable to induce goosecoid because it directly activates expression of Xom, a repressor of goosecoid that acts downstream of BMP signaling. We show that the inability of Xbra to induce goosecoid is imposed by an N-terminal domain that interacts with the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad1, a component of the BMP signal transduction pathway. Interference with this interaction causes ectopic activation of goosecoid and anteriorization of the embryo. These findings suggest a mechanism by which individual T-domain proteins may interact with different partners to elicit a specific response.</str>

      <str>To explore the toxic effects of ethanol on axis formation during embryogenesis, zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages were treated with 3% ethanol for 3h. The effects of ethanol exposure appeared to be stage-dependent. The dome stage embryo was most sensible to form posterior split axes upon ethanol exposure. Morphological and histological observations and whole-mount in situ hybridization results showed that ethanol exposure at this stage caused a general gastrulation delay, and induced double notochords, double neural tubes and two sets of somites in the posterior trunk. Mechanistically, no ectopic organizer was found by examining the expression patterns of dorsoventral markers including goosecoid, chordin and eve1 at the onset of gastrulation. However, radial intercalation, epiboly and convergence extension were inhibited by ethanol exposure as revealed by cell labeling, phenotypic observation and the expression patterns of axial or paraxial markers. Further investigation showed that the cell aggregation might be affected by ethanol exposure, as indicated by the much more scattered expression pattern of chordin, eve1 and wnt11 at the early gastrula stage, and the discontinuous gsc positive cells during migration. These results imply that ethanol might affect cell movement before and during gastrulation and as a consequence, induces a split axes phenotype.</str>

      <str>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) belongs to a family of polypeptides with diverse biological functions. In the present study we have assessed the role of FGF signaling in the development of nervous system and mesodermal tissues in chick embryo. Treatment of in vitro cultured embryos with exogenous, human recombinant FGF led to abnormalities in neural induction and development, notochord formation and somitogenesis as studied by gross morphology and histology. Overall growth and development was also adversely affected as seen from the measurement of body axis length. Further, treatment of embryos with FGF resulted in differential modulation of expression of two genes important in normal development as studied by whole mount in situ hybridization using DIG-labeled riboprobes. The expression of Brachyury, which is necessary for mesoderm formation, was down-regulated in FGF-treated embryos. The expression of noggin, the product which participates in the patterning of the chick neural tube was, on the other hand, up-regulated within 2 h. We also studied development of neural and mesodermal tissues in conditions where FGF signaling was defective. This was achieved by culturing the embryos in the presence of suramin. In the presence of low doses of suramin (100-150 nmole/culture), abnormalities were detected mainly in the mesodermal structures while at higher doses (200-400 nmole/culture), the nervous system too was found to be abnormal in a large proportion of embryos. Treatment of chick embryos with suramin (200 nmole/culture) also modulated the expression of Brachyuryand noggin within a 2 h period. The results showthat FGF signaling plays an important role in the molecular events leading to the development of nervous system and mesodermal tissues in the chick embryo.</str>

      <str>We have studied the role of the activin immediate-early response gene Mix.1 in mesoderm and endoderm formation. In early gastrulae, Mix.1 is expressed throughout the vegetal hemisphere, including marginal-zone cells expressing the trunk mesodermal marker Xbra. During gastrulation, the expression domains of Xbra and Mix.1 become progressively exclusive as a result of the establishment of a negative regulatory loop between these two genes. This mutual repression is important for the specification of the embryonic body plan as ectopic expression of Mix.1 in the Xbra domain suppresses mesoderm differentiation. The same effect was obtained by overexpressing VP16Mix.1, a fusion protein comprising the strong activator domain of viral VP16 and the homeodomain of Mix.1, suggesting that Mix.1 acts as a transcriptional activator. Mix.1 also has a role in endoderm formation. It cooperates with the dorsal vegetal homeobox gene Siamois to activate the endodermal markers edd, Xlhbox8 and cerberus in animal caps. Conversely, vegetal overexpression of enRMix.1, an antimorphic Mix.1 mutant, leads to a loss of endoderm differentiation. Finally, by targeting enRMix.1 expression to the anterior endoderm, we could test the role of this tissue during embryogenesis and show that it is required for head formation.</str>

      <str>Exposure of vertebrate embryos to ethanol causes cyclopia, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this effect. Here we show that cyclopia can be induced in the zebrafish by a short ethanol treatment during early gastrula stages and is accompanied by loss of gene expression characteristic of the ventral aspects of the fore- and midbrain. Interestingly, defects in the expression of ventral brain markers are linked to impaired migration of the prechordal plate mesoderm indicating that the correct position of the prechordal plate mesoderm under the anterior neural plate in the zebrafish embryo is required for specification of the anterior neural midline. Ethanol-induced cyclopia does not, however, impair the induction of anterior neuroectodermal structures in general. Finally, as genes like goosecoid and islet-1 are expressed in prechordal plate cells in a temporal pattern similar to control embryos despite the ectopic position of expressing cells, it appears that regulation of prechordal plate-specific gene expression is largely independent of the final position of the prechordal plate.</str>

      <str>The Mix/Bix family of Pax-like homeodomain transcription factors is expressed early in vertebrate development and play important roles in endoderm and mesoderm formation. Like other Pax-related homeodomain proteins, the Mix/Bix family binds DNA as monomers or dimers and dimerization is mediated by the homeodomain. While the Mix/Bix family shares extensive sequence homology within the DNA-binding homeodomain, ectopic expression of these proteins has profoundly different outcomes. Expression of Xenopus Mix.3/Mixer in explanted ectoderm results in endoderm differentiation, whereas Mix.1 expression does not. In this study we sought to define the domains of Mix.3/Mixer that are responsible for this endoderm inducing activity. We generated domain swap mutants between Mix.3/Mixer and Mix.1 and tested their ability to induce endoderm in explanted ectoderm. We demonstrate that the homeodomain and sixty-two amino acids in the carboxyl terminus are required to induce endoderm and that these domains must be on the same polypeptide and can not act in trans as a heterodimer. A Smad2 interaction motif in Mix.3/Mixer is involved in endoderm differentiation but is not essential. Thus, we have defined the regions of Mix.3/Mixer that confer endoderm-inducing activity. These studies reveal a novel co-operation between the homeodomain and a small domain in the carboxyl terminal region that is essential for Mix.3/Mixer function.</str>

      <str>Bone marrow (BM) has long been considered a potential stem cell source for cardiac repair due to its abundance and accessibility. Although previous investigations have generated cardiomyocytes from BM, yields have been low, and far less than produced from ES or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Since differentiation of pluripotent cells is difficult to control, we investigated whether BM cardiac competency could be enhanced without making cells pluripotent. From screens of various molecules that have been shown to assist iPSC production or maintain the ES cell phenotype, we identified the G9a histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294 as a potential reprogramming agent for converting BM cells to a cardiac-competent phenotype. BM cells exposed to BIX01294 displayed significantly elevated expression of brachyury, Mesp1, and islet1, which are genes associated with embryonic cardiac progenitors. In contrast, BIX01294 treatment minimally affected ectodermal, endodermal, and pluripotency gene expression by BM cells. Expression of cardiac-associated genes Nkx2.5, GATA4, Hand1, Hand2, Tbx5, myocardin, and titin was enhanced 114, 76, 276, 46, 635, 123, and 5-fold in response to the cardiogenic stimulator Wnt11 when BM cells were pretreated with BIX01294. Immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated that BIX01294 exposure allowed for the subsequent display of various muscle proteins within the cells. The effect of BIX01294 on the BM cell phenotype and differentiation potential corresponded to an overall decrease in methylation of histone H3 at lysine9, which is the primary target of G9a histone methyltransferase. In summary, these data suggest that BIX01294 inhibition of chromatin methylation reprograms BM cells to a cardiac-competent progenitor phenotype.</str>

      <str>In this study, we have ascertained the presence and functionality in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) of members of the endocannabinoid system that have been proposed as possible modulators of the survival and differentiation of various type of stem cells. We show that mouse ESCs, in addition to classical CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptors, express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor, at mRNA, protein, and binding levels. Remarkably, we demonstrate that ESCs have the mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity to synthesize and degrade the prominent endocannabinoids anandamide (through N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D and fatty acid amide hydrolase) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (through diacylglycerol lipase and monoacylglycerol lipase). In addition, both endocannabinoids were detected in ESCs that were also shown to constitutively release a fatty acid amide hydrolase-activating compound. Finally, we document that the stimulation of ESCs by methanandamide, a nonhydrolysable analog of anandamide, does not lead to overt alteration of the expression of Oct3/4, Nanog, and Cdx2, genes that are involved in early cell fate in the preimplantation embryo and stemness, or of the expression patterns of Brachyury and Hnf4, genes that are used as late markers of lineage differentiation capability of ESC-derived embryoid bodies. Similarly ineffective on the expression of the tested stemness genes was 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Taken together, these results confirm and extend the notion that ESCs express several functional members of the endocannabinoid system, but they leave open the question about their role in stem cells as modulators of stemness and differentiation potential.</str>

      <str>The Xenopus mid-blastula transition (MBT) marks the onset of large-scale zygotic transcription, as well as an increase in cell cycle length and a loss of synchronous cell divisions. Little is known about what triggers the activation of transcription or how newly expressed genes interact with each other. Here, we use high-resolution expression profiling to identify three waves of gene activity: a post-fertilisation wave involving polyadenylation of maternal transcripts; a broad wave of zygotic transcription detectable as early as the seventh cleavage and extending beyond the MBT at the twelfth cleavage; and a shorter post-MBT wave of transcription that becomes apparent as development proceeds. Our studies have also allowed us to define a set of maternal mRNAs that are deadenylated shortly after fertilisation, and are likely to be degraded thereafter. Experimental analysis indicates that the polyadenylation of maternal transcripts is necessary for the establishment of proper levels of zygotic transcription at the MBT, and that genes activated in the second wave of expression, including Brachyury and Mixer, contribute to the regulation of genes expressed in the third. Together, our high-resolution time series and experimental studies have yielded a deeper understanding of the temporal organisation of gene regulatory networks in the early Xenopus embryo. </str>

However, the inhibitory effect of shRNA remains problematic in fish. We demonstrated that silencing efficiency by shRNA produced from the hybrid construct composed of the CMV enhancer or entire CMV promoter placed immediately upstream of a U6 promoter. When tested the exogenous gene, silencing of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) target gene was 89.18 +/- 5.06% for CMVE-U6 promoter group and 88.26 +/- 6.46% for CMV-U6 promoter group. To test the hybrid promoters driving shRNA efficiency against an endogenous gene, we used shRNA against no tail (NTL) gene. When vectorized in the zebrafish, the hybrid constructs strongly repressed NTL gene expression. The NTL phenotype occupied 52.09 +/- 3.06% and 51.56 +/- 3.68% for CMVE-U6 promoter and CMV-U6 promoter groups, respectively. The NTL gene expression reduced 82.17 +/- 2.96% for CMVE-U6 promoter group and 83.06 +/- 2.38% for CMV-U6 promoter group. We concluded that the CMV enhancer or entire CMV promoter locating upstream of the U6-promoter could significantly improve inhibitory effect induced by the shRNA for both exogenous and endogenous genes compared with the CMV promoter or U6 promoter alone.

      <str>Hydroides elegans is an indirectly developing polychaete with equal spiral cleavage, gastrulation by invagination, and a feeding trochophore. Expression of several transcription factors and differentiation genes has been characterized. Comparative analysis reveals evolutionarily conserved roles. For example, the synexpression of transcription factors FoxA and Brachyury suggests homology of primary and secondary gut openings in protostomes and deuterostomes, and the expression of Sall suggests similar regulatory controls in the posterior growth zone of bilaterians. Differences in gene expression suggest regulatory differences control gastrulation by invagination in polychaetes with a feeding trochophore and gastrulation by epiboly in polychaetes without a feeding trochophore. Association of histone variant H2A.Z with transcriptional potency and its expression suggest a developmental role during both embryogenesis and the larva-to-adult transformation. Methods are being developed for experimental exploration of the gene regulatory networks involved in trochophore development in Hydroides. It is unknown if polychaete feeding trochophores evolved from a larval stage already present in the life cycle of the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. Previous evolutionary scenarios about larval origins overemphasize the discontinuity between larval and adult development and require the early evolution of undifferentiated and transcriptionally potent "set aside" cells. Indirect development may proceed by developmental remodeling of differentiated cells and could have evolved after gradual transformation of juveniles into larvae; undifferentiated and transcriptionally potent cells would have evolved secondarily. Comprehensive characterization of gene regulatory networks for feeding trochophore development may help resolve these major evolutionary questions. </str>

      <str>The abnormalities of haploid medaka embryos were characterized by comparative analysis of histologic sections and expression patterns of some developmental marker genes between haploids and diploids to clarify whether medaka haploids are useful for identifying mutants. During gastrulation, an obvious defect was first observed as a delay of epiboly and involution. This delay was shown to be caused not by the perturbation of mesoderm induction, but by widespread cell death and disorganization of cell arrangement in the blastoderm. This disorganization of cell arrangement was also detected in various organs, such as the brain, somite and notochord, at a late developmental stage. Ten days after fertilization, a small head and a short body axis were formed; these changes were also observed in haploid embryos in other species, but their cause is unknown. Based on the expression patterns of HNF3beta and goosecoid, it was demonstrated that a short and impotent prechordal plate induced near the marginal zone in haploid embryos was responsible for this defect. However, in these experiments it was also demonstrated that many major organs in haploids, such as the somite and notochord, differentiated incompletely but were present. Therefore, it was concluded that haploid screening is suitable for identifying mutations revealed by an obvious phenotype, such as dorsoventral polarity.</str>

      <str>Lancelets (amphioxus), although showing the most similar anatomical features to vertebrates, never develop a vertebrate-like head but rather several structures specific to this animal. The lancelet anatomical specificity seems to be traceable to early developmental stages, such as the vertebrate dorsal and anterior-posterior determinations. The BMP and Wnt proteins play important roles in establishing the early basis of the dorsal structures and the head in vertebrates. The early behavior of BMP and Wnt may be also related to the specific body structures of lancelets. The expression patterns of a dpp-related gene, Bbbmp2/4, and two wnt-related genes, Bbwnt7 and Bbwnt8, have been studied in comparison with those of brachyury and Hnf-3beta class genes. The temporal expression patterns of these genes are similar to those of vertebrates; Bbbmp2/4 and Bbwnt8 are first expressed in the invaginating primitive gut and the equatorial region, respectively, at the initial gastrula stage. However, spatial expression pattern of Bbbmp2/4 differs significantly from the vertebrate cognates. It is expressed in the mid-dorsal inner layer of gastrulae and widely in the anterior region, in which vertebrates block BMP signaling. The present study suggests that the lancelet embryo may have two distinct developmental domains from the gastrula stage, the domains of which coincide later with the lateral diverticular and the somitocoelomic regions. The embryonic origin of the anterior-specific structures in lancelets corresponds to the anterior domain where Bbbmp2/4 is continuously expressed.</str>

      <str>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/MAPK pathway plays an important role in early Xenopus developmental processes, including mesoderm patterning. The activation of the MAPK pathway leads to induction of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra), which regulates the transcription of downstream mesoderm-specific genes in mesoderm patterning. However, the link between the FGF/MAPK pathway and the induction of Xbra has not been fully understood. Here we present evidence suggesting that Ets-2 is involved in the induction of Xbra and thus in the development of posterior mesoderm during early embryonic development. Overexpression of Ets-2 caused posteriorized embryos and led to the induction of mesoderm in ectodermal explants. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Ets-2 or injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against Ets-2 inhibited the formation of the trunk and tail structures. Overexpression of Ets-2 resulted in the induction of Xbra, and expression of the dominant-negative Ets-2 inhibited FGF- or constitutively active MEK-induced Xbra expression. Moreover, overexpression of Ets-2 up-regulated the transcription from Xbra promoter reporter gene constructs. Ets-2 bound to the Xbra promoter region in vitro. These results taken together indicate that Xenopus Ets-2 plays an essential role in mesoderm patterning, lying between the FGF/MAPK pathway and the Xbra transcription.</str>

This case was treated with staged vertebrectomy and fibular strut graft reconstruction and the results of clinical and radiological follow up at 8 years are presented.</str>

      <str>The classification of cartilaginous tumors of the skull base, including chondroid chordoma and chondrosarcoma remains the subject of controversy. Critical review of the literature and our own experience of chordomas and cartilaginous tumors of the skull base led to the following conclusions: 1) Chondrosarcoma of the skull base is a distinct clinicopathological entity. The immunohistochemical staining pattern (cytokeratin negative, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) negative) can be helpful in distinguishing it from chordoma with chondroid differentiation (cytokeratin positive, EMA positive). 2) The chondroid chordomas originally described by Heffelfinger et al. may have included some true chondrosarcomas with focal areas of myxoid chordomalike appearance. 3) Focal chondroid differentiation in chordoma is not such a rare phenomenon. Further study is needed to define whether chordoma with chondroid foci should be separated out from conventional chordoma as a distinct entity with a better prognosis.</str>

      <str>A patient who received radiation therapy for a sacral lesion 10 years ago and eventually developed dedifferentiated chordoma at the primary site is reported. Initially, the patient received 54 Gy with Co-60 to the sacral tumor, and 6 years later an additional 50 Gy with 10 MV X-rays to the local recurrence. Four years later, an evident sacral tumor was noticed. When readmitted for re-confirmation of histology, a large rapidly growing lung metastasis was observed. The patient eventually died of progressive disease with incidental aspiration pneumonia. At autopsy, 10 years after the initial treatment, the recurrent sacral tumor proved to be dedifferentiated chordoma accompanied by typical chordoma. Although this case suggests the possible malignant transformation of chordoma rather than collision, the factors inducing this change remain unknown.</str>

      <str>Three cases of "dedifferentiated" chordoma arising in the sacrococcygeal region are presented. In all three cases, the "dedifferentiated" component arose de novo in conjunction with conventional chordoma. Two of these patients, whose tumors had a prominent malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) component, died within 6 months of diagnosis. Both patients had lung metastases, one of which was histologically documented to be MFH. The third patient, whose initial tumor contained osteosarcoma, died 76 months after diagnosis and multiple recurrences. Most notable in this case was the absence of the "dedifferentiated" component (in this instance, osteosarcoma) in all of the local recurrences as well as the lung metastases. These were composed exclusively of conventional chordoma. None of the patients had a previous history of radiation therapy. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of conventional chordoma was similar to that of previous reports, where the epithelial-like cells stained for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. In addition, they stained for alpha-1-anti-chymotrypsin and vimentin. These latter two markers were also identified in the "dedifferentiated" component. As with "dedifferentiated" chondrosarcomas and liposarcomas, "dedifferentiation" in a chordoma usually portends an accelerated clinical course.</str>

      <str>A 26-year-old woman was operated on for a bulky tumor in the sacral region; she died of massive local tumor recurrence and pulmonary metastases 3 months later. Most of the original tumor showed a highly cellular spindle-cell sarcoma compatible with a fibrosarcoma of a high grade of malignancy. In a few small areas of the tumor, a chordoma-like pattern surrounded by growth of spindle-cell sarcoma was found. The spindle-cell component exhibited vimentin positivity in all tumor cells, but many cells were also cytokeratin-positive. The chordoma-like areas showed cytokeratin in all tumor cells. The chordoma-like areas, but not the spindle-cell areas also were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and S-100 protein. This case indicates that the sarcomatous change associated with chordoma may contain keratins as a sign of epithelial differentiation, and may thus represent sarcomatous transformation of chordoma cells, rather than a coincidental soft-tissue sarcoma or collision tumor.</str>

      <str>Two cases of sacral chordoma in a 7-year, 9-month-old boy and a 3-year, 4-month-old boy are presented. In addition to the typical histology of conventional chordoma, both tumors showed the less differentiated sarcomatoid appearance of atypical chordoma in the major portion. Immunohistochemically, in both cases neoplastic cells in areas of conventional as well as atypical chordoma were positive for keratins (CAM 5.2, AE1 and AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, S-100 protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Both patients underwent resection of the tumor and chemotherapy. In comparison with conventional chordomas in adults, however, these two tumors showed more aggressive clinical course and were less amenable to therapeutic control. The older boy died of multiple metastasis 1 year after initial diagnosis. At the last follow-up, 15 months after initial diagnosis, the younger boy was alive, but with recurrent and metastatic disease of the left parasacral area and chest wall. Our studies of these two cases and the reported cases suggest that sacral chordoma in children has distinctive clinicopathologic features denoting a highly aggressive tumor and that it should be treated as such.</str>

We describe a case of chordoma involving the oropharynx inferiorly that was diagnosed by transoral fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology (FNAC) and confirmed by histologic studies. This appears to be 1 of the few reported applications of FNA in the diagnosis of chordoma of the oropharynx in the English-language literature.</str>
      <str>A 50-year-old male presented with nocturnal dyspnea and rare hemoptysis for 6 months. A hypodense mass was located in the left posterior side of the oropharynx.

      <str>Following recent progress in radiological and surgical techniques for treating skull base tumours, more attention should be paid to the relatively rare phenomenon of intradural spinal seeding in cases of clival chordoma.</str>
      <str>A 53-year-old man harboured intradural spinal seeding from a clival chordoma 11 years after his initial surgical treatment. He had undergone skull base surgery five times with extra- and intradural approaches, and adjuvant radiotherapy. His complaints of lumbago, paraparesis, and sensory disturbance of the lower left extremity prompted us to carry out imaging studies of the spinal cord, which revealed multiple intradural, extramedullary mass lesions at the thoracic and lumbosacral spinal level. The tumours were histopathologically diagnosed as spinal seeding of the clival chordoma with high proliferative potential (Ki-67 labelling index of 8.4%).</str>

      <str>Differential diagnosis of chordoma and chondroma in the skull base is sometimes difficult. We retrospectively reviewed the MR images of 14 patients with skull base tumors (nine chordomas, four chondromas and one chondrosarcoma). MR imaging was performed with a 0.5 Tesla system (Picker International). Inversion recovery (IR) (2500-2100/600-500/40), T1-weighted spin echo (SE) (800-600/40), and T2-weighted SE (2500-1800/120) images were obtained. On IR images, seven of eight chordomas showed heterogeneous low signal intensity, and one chordoma and all chondromas showed markedly low signal intensity similar to that of CSF. Calcified or ossified portions of the chondromas were demonstrated as areas of moderately low intensity on IR images. Chondrosarcoma showed moderately low intensity similar to that of chordoma. T1-weighted SE images of chordoma and chondroma showed no difference in signal intensity. On T2-weighed SE images, six of nine chordomas and all chondromas showed markedly high signal intensity. Three chordomas and one chondrosarcoma showed moderately high signal intensity. In the diagnosis of skull base tumors, the IR sequence seems to be useful for differentiating chondroma from chordoma.</str>

Although cranial chordomas in childhood are extremely rare, and all previously reported cases appeared to have arisen in the clivus, this location should not be considered ectopic. Forking at the rostral end of the notochord has been demonstrated in embryos, and would be the presumed embryological source for this tumor. This is also the first reported case of a chondroid chordoma in a child with immunohistochemical documentation distinguishing it from a chondrosarcoma. This chondroid chordoma contained two populations of cells: neoplastic cartilage and chordoid tissue in a myxoid stroma.

      <str>A histologically typical chordoma and its four recurrences (3.5, 4, 7, and 7.5 years later) were operated from the spinal canal and I-III lumbar vertebrae of a 49-year-old woman. In addition to the typical areas of chordoma, pleomorphic areas resembling malignant fibrous histiocytoma also were seen in the fourth recurrence. The chordoma-like areas of the fourth recurrence displayed typical epithelial features: clusters of epithelial-like cells, electron microscopically demonstrable vacuoles lined by microvilli and desmosomes, and cytokeratin positivity in immunostaining. The areas in the fourth recurrence that resembled malignant fibrous histiocytoma lacked epithelial features as judged by electron microscopy. They also were negative for cytokeratin but contained, instead, vimentin type of intermediate filaments. The results show that the sarcomatous areas as seen in the recurrent chordoma lack epithelial cell features of chordoma and suggest the possibility of altered differentiation pathway of the tumor stem cell or emergence of a new malignant cell population within the recurrent tumor.</str>

      <str>A 44-year-old woman presented with a thoracic chordoma with intrathoracic extension manifesting as complaints of lower extremity weakness, hypesthesia below the levels of T5-6, and sphincter incontinence. Almost total resection combined with anterior interbody fusion and stabilization was possible through a left transpleural transthoracic approach. She suffered recurrence after 2 years and was considered inoperable. Biopsy revealed a malignant chordoma with no sarcomatous differentiation. Chordoma is an uncommon malignant bone tumor originating from remnants of the embryonal notochord, occurring mostly along the axial skeleton, at the extremity of the vertebral spine, and is least common in the thoracic region. Differential diagnosis is problematic and biopsy is helpful particularly if considered inoperable. Thoracic chordomas of the malignant type manifest as cord or root compression. Classical malignant chordomas must be distinguished from chondroid, benign, or other types of chordomas, since the biological behavior and clinical features are distinct. However, the differential diagnosis cannot be based on histological examination, but long-term follow up is required. Most patients have extradural and intraspinal tissue extension at the time of diagnosis, which makes complete resection impossible. Aggressive surgery without violation of surgical borders is the best choice in the treatment of thoracic chordoma. Thoracic chordoma is a recurring neoplasm and is prone to dissemination and sarcomatous differentiation despite its slow-growing nature.</str>

The original conventional chordoma was treated postoperatively with external beam radiation therapy, and the patient was free of disease until he presented at the age of 71 with leg weakness. Computerized tomography revealed a lumbo-sacral soft tissue mass. This was excised and found to have three distinct histologic aspects. The largest component was that of a conventional chordoma. The second component consisted of islands of malignant cartilage intimately admixed with the cells of the conventional chordoma.

      <str>Previous studies have documented the existence of intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumors (BNCTs) within the axial skeleton. Evidence suggests that they may be associated with the development of chordomas. To further investigate the relationship between BNCT and classic chordoma, we reviewed a large series of resected sacral/coccygeal chordomas in an attempt to identify the presence of coexisting BNCTs.</str>
      <str>Eighty-two sacrectomy/coccygectomy specimens performed for chordoma were identified. Available hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed to identify BNCTs and assess their relationship with the coexisting chordoma. BNCTs were defined, in accordance with prior descriptions, as cohesive aggregates of large cells that appeared adipocyte-like because of their vacuolated cytoplasm. The cells exhibited only minimal nuclear atypia and lacked lobulation and myxoid stroma.</str>
      <str>We identified 6 BNCTs, each was adjacent to but separate from the sacral chordoma. There were 5 females and 1 male, and the mean age was 58 years. Five lesions arose in the sacrum. One lesion arose in the coccyx, and involved 2 contiguous vertebral levels. The BNCTs ranged in size from 1 to 20 mm with a mean size of 6.1 mm. The lesions were exclusively composed of adipocyte-like nuclei without significant nuclear atypia or myxoid stroma. Three lesions contained sclerotic bony trabeculae and intralesional hematopoietic elements were identified in 1 case. In all cases the chordoma was of the conventional type and were morphologically different from the BNCT.</str>
      <str>BNCTs were identified in 7.3% of sacral/coccygeal resections performed for primary chordoma. We speculate that this finding provides further evidence that BNCT is the precursor lesion for chordoma. Additional investigations are needed to further understand this relationship.</str>

      <str>Benign notochordal cell tumours have recently been described as intraosseous benign lesions of notochordal cell origin. The lesions are found in vertebral bodies in 20% of autopsy studies and are a potential precursor of chordoma. We report a rare case of lumbar vertebral chordoma that was thought to arise from a benign intraosseous notochordal cell tumour and which showed significant osteosclerotic change. Radiologically, the lumbar vertebral mass lesion showed hyperintensity on T2 weighted images, with scanty enhancement on post-contrast T1 weighted MR images. High uptake corresponding to the mass was noted on fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Bone biopsy revealed proliferation of the physaliphorous cells between thickened bone trabeculae; no nuclear mitosis was observed. Although the mass was diagnosed clinically as spinal chordoma, histopathology contained both benign notochordal cell tumour and conventional chordoma. After heavy particle (11C)-charged radiation therapy was applied to the lesion with a sufficient radiation field margin, the tumour volume significantly decreased and there was improvement in the patient's symptoms. On follow-up radiological studies, the tumour had markedly regressed and there was no tumour regrowth or distant metastasis. In this case report, benign notochordal cell tumour and conventional chordoma are histopathologically identified in the L1 vertebral body, which contains osteosclerotic and osteolytic areas. It is suggested that the benign notochordal cell tumour coexists with a conventional chordoma and that this histopathological finding supports a hypothetical relationship between benign notochordal cell tumour and chordoma.</str>

      <str> Chordoma is a rare mesenchymal tumour of complex biology for which only histologic and immunohistochemical criteria have been defined, but no biomarkers predicting the clinical outcome and response to treatment have yet been recognised. We herein review the interdisciplinary information achieved by epidemiologists, neurosurgeons and basic scientists on chordoma, usually a sporadic tumour, which also includes a small fraction of familial cases. Main focus is on the current knowledge of the genetic alterations which might pinpoint candidate genes and molecular mechanisms shared by sporadic and familiar chordomas. Due to the scarcity of the investigated tumour specimens and the multiple chromosome abnormalities found in tumours with aberrant karyotypes, conventional cytogenetics and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization failed to detect recurrent chordoma-specific chromosomal rearrangements. Genome-wide approaches such as Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) are yet at an initial stage of application and should be implemented using BAC arrays either genome-wide or targeting selected genomic regions, disclosed by Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) studies. An LOH region was shown by a systematic study on a consistent number of chordomas to encompass 1p36, a genomic interval where a candidate gene was suggested to reside. Despite the rarity of multiplex families with chordoma impaired linkage studies, a chordoma locus could be mapped to chromosome 7q33 by positive lod score in three independent families. The role in chordomagenesis of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) genes has been proved, but the extent of involvement of TSC1 and TSC2 oncosuppressors in chordoma remains to be assessed. In spite of the scarce knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of chordoma, recent initiation of clinical trials using molecular-targeted therapy, should validate new molecular targets and predict the efficacy of a given therapy. Comparative genetic and biomolecular studies should enhance the molecular taxonomy of chordoma which might have a prognostic significance and better orient the therapeutic options.</str>

The ratio of total removal tumor was enhanced to 73.9% (17/23) from 34.8% (8/23). Among 15 cases of partial chordoma removal detected by scanning in operation, 9 were huge chordoma. The residual of huge chordoma detected by scanning in operation was 9/11, and other chordoma contributed to 6/12. There were no iMRI related safety issue or accident recorded in this study.</str>

      <str>Patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic chordoma, STS, or GIST received 9-NC 1.25 mg/m2 orally for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 days of rest. Patients continued on therapy until disease progression, uncontrollable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.</str>
      <str>From January 2000 to May 2003, 51 patients (15 chordoma, 23 STS, 13 GIST patients) enrolled. One patient (7%) with chordoma and one patient (4%) with STS had an objective response. Median time to progression was 9.9, 8.0, and 8.3 weeks for chordoma, STS, and GIST patients, respectively. Three- and 6-month progression-free survival rates were 47% and 33% for chordoma patients, 26% and 22% for STS patients, and 31% and 23% for GIST patients, respectively. Ten patients (10%) stopped study drug before disease progression secondary to toxicity. Common adverse events included anemia (42 patients, seven with grade 3/4 toxicity), leukopenia (33 patients, nine with grade 3/4 toxicity), fatigue (30 patients, three with grade 3/4 toxicity), nausea (34 patients, six with grade 3/4 toxicity), and diarrhea (28 patients, five with grade 3/4 toxicity).</str>

      <str>Chordoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of notochord origin that occurs along the craniospinal axis, and extranotochordal chordoma is extremely unusual. An aberrant origin of this neoplasm can pose diagnostic pitfalls. We report a case of primary cervical chordoma of extranotochordal origin clinically presenting as a thyroid neoplasm. The cytomorphologic features of chordoma and its cytologic differential diagnoses are discussed.</str>
      <str>An 82-year-old man presented with hoarseness of voice and difficulty in swallowing. He had a mass in the anterolateral aspect of the right side of the neck. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with contrast study revealed an ill-defined, contrast-enhancing tumor mass located in the right retrolaryngeal and parapharyngeal space at the level of C4, invading the perithyroidal soft tissue. Aspiration biopsy cytology of the tumor demonstrated epithelial-like cells with varied cytomorphologic features causing differential diagnostic problems with thyroid and soft tissue. However, the diagnosis of extranotochordal chordoma was established by the subsequent histologic examination of the excisional biopsy specimen.</str>
      <str>Since chordoma is capable of exhibiting a spectrum of cytomorphologic characteristics and can have cytologic features overlapping with other malignant neoplasms, a high index of suspicion is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis on fine needle aspiration biopsy. This case highlights the occurrence of a rare neoplasm at an aberrant site and the diagnostic challenges that can pose. However, awareness of the abnormal locations and characteristic cytomorphologic features of chordoma together with radiologic findings will usually keep the cytopathologist from making a wrong diagnosis.</str>

      <str>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a primary responder to vascular endothelial growth factor signal and thereby regulates endothelial migration and proliferation. This receptor is expressed in endothelial cells and in some vascular tumors, but many reports also detail its expression in carcinomas and lymphomas. VEGFR2 is a potential cell-type marker, and data on VEGFR2 expression may also have therapeutic significance in view of recent availability of VEGFR2 inhibitors. In this study, we immunohistochemically examined 262 vascular endothelial and 1640 nonvascular tumors and selected non-neoplastic tissues with a VEGFR2-specific rabbit monoclonal antibody 55B11. In early human embryo, VEFGR2 was expressed in endothelia of developing capillaries and in the thoracic duct, great vessels, hepatic sinusoids, epidermis, and mesothelia. In late first trimester fetus peripheral soft tissues, VEGFR2 was restricted to capillary endothelia, chondrocytes, and superficial portion of the epidermis. In normal adult tissues, it was restricted to endothelia and mesothelia. VEGFR2 was consistently expressed in angiosarcomas, Kaposi sarcomas, and retiform hemangioendotheliomas. It was detected in only half of epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (15/27), usually focally. VEGFR2 was strongly expressed in most capillary hemangiomas and weakly or focally in cavernous, venous, and spindle cell hemangiomas and in lymphangiomas. Malignant epithelial mesothelioma was found to be a unique epithelial neoplasm with a strong and nearly consistent VEGFR2 expression, including membrane staining (35/38). Approximately 10% of squamous cell carcinomas and 23% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas contained focal positivity. The only nonendothelial mesenchymal tumors found to be VEGFR2 positive were biphasic synovial sarcoma (focal epithelial expression) and chordoma. All melanomas and lymphomas were negative. VEGFR2 is a promising marker for malignant vascular tumors and malignant epithelioid mesothelioma. Expression in biphasic synovial sarcoma epithelium, chordoma, and some carcinomas has to be considered in differential diagnosis. Information on VEGFR2 tissue expression may be useful in development of targeted oncologic therapy through VEGFR2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</str>

      <str>The prognosis of chordomas is difficult to predict based solely on histological findings. The purpose of this study was to assess the immunohistochemical expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 antigen and the expression of p53 in skull base chordomas and to relate their expressions to the outcome. We examined the expression of p53 and the MIB-1 labeling index (LI), assessed by Ki-67 expression, in 19 tumors (initial, n = 11; recurrent, n = 8) from 11 patients. The correlation among the MIB-1 LI, p53 expression, and the clinical outcome was analyzed. The mean MIB-1 LI and p53 expression at the initial surgery were 5.6 +/- 4.6% and 9.0 +/- 9.4%, respectively. At the time of recurrence, the mean MIB-1 LI and p53 expression were 10.2 +/- 7.4% and 16.5 +/- 12.0%. The correlation between the MIB-1 LI and p53 expression at the initial and recurrent surgeries was highly significant (r = 0.948; P &lt; 0.0001). The change in p53 expression from the initial to the recurrent chordomas was significantly greater in patients who died of tumor-related causes than in the surviving patients. In the surviving patients, the values for MIB-1 LI and p53 expression in the recurrent tumors were significantly higher in the disease-ongoing group than in the disease-free group. Our results suggest that determination of the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and Ki-67 antigen is helpful to predict tumor recurrence and prognosis in skull base chordomas.</str>

In the present study, we have performed the first detailed analysis of the expression of alpha 2,6-ST and alpha 2,6-linked sialoglycoconjugates in human brain tumors. We used a polyclonal, monospecific anti-rat alpha 2,6-ST antibody and the alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid-specific lectin, Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) for histochemical studies, and a human alpha 2,6-ST-specific cDNA probe for Northern analysis. Meningiomas, chordomas and craniopharyngiomas frequently expressed alpha 2,6-ST and alpha 2,6-linked sialoglycoconjugates. Among the different meningioma subtypes, meningothelial meningiomas stained more strongly with both anti-alpha 2,6-ST antibody and SNA than the fibroblastic and anaplastic meningiomas. On the other hand, all tumors of glial origin and medulloblastomas were virtually devoid of either alpha 2,6-ST or alpha 2,6-linked sialoglycoconjugate expression. Moreover, very weak to negligible expression of both alpha 2,6-ST and alpha 2,6-linked sialoglycoconjugates was observed in brain metastases. In conclusion, alpha 2,6-ST and alpha 2,6-linked sialoglycoconjugate expression is associated with non-neuroectodermal epithelial-like tumors.</str>

      <str>The prognosis of pediatric chordomas is difficult to predict based on histology. The objective of this study was to assess the expression of a proliferation marker and adhesion molecules in pediatric chordomas and relate the expressions to outcome. In 8 pediatric chordomas, we calculated the MIB-1 labeling index (LI) by counting the number of MIB-1-positive tumor cells in 100 tumor cells. The grade of expression of E-cadherin and CD44 was calculated by estimating the percentage of tumor cells expressing these markers. MIB-1 LI correlated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.007) and low survival rate (P = 0.007). The expression of E-cadherin correlated with disease-free survival (P = 0.009), tumor recurrence (P &gt; 0.0007), and low survival rate (P &gt; 0.0007). CD44 expression did not correlate with recurrence (P = 0.056) or survival rate (P = 0.056).

      <str>In Xenopus, the prospective endoderm and mesoderm are localized to discrete, adjacent domains at the beginning of gastrulation, and this is made evident by the expression of Sox17 in vegetal blastomeres and Brachyury (Xbra) in marginal blastomeres. Here, we examine the regulation of Sox17alpha expression and the role of Sox17alpha in establishing the vegetal endodermal gene expression domain. Injection of specific inhibitors of VegT or Nodal resulted in a loss of Sox17alpha expression in the gastrula. However, the onset of Sox17alpha expression at the midblastula transition was dependent on VegT, but not on Nodal function, indicating that Sox17alpha expression is initiated by VegT and then maintained by Nodal signals. Consistent with these results, VegT, but not Xenopus Nodal-related-1 (Xnr1), can activate Sox17alpha expression at the midblastula stage in animal explants. In addition, VegT activates Sox17alpha in the presence of cycloheximide or a Nodal antagonist, suggesting that Sox17alpha is an immediate-early target of VegT in vegetal blastomeres. Given that Nodal signals are necessary and sufficient for both mesodermal and endodermal gene expression, we propose that VegT activation of Sox17alpha at the midblastula transition prevents mesodermal gene expression in response to Nodal signals, thus establishing the vegetal endodermal gene expression domain. Supporting this idea, Sox17alpha misexpression in the marginal zone inhibits the expression of multiple mesodermal genes. Furthermore, in animal explants, Sox17alpha prevents the induction of Xbra and MyoD, but not Sox17beta or Mixer, in response to Xnr1. Therefore, VegT activation of Sox17alpha plays an important role in establishing a region of endoderm-specific gene expression in vegetal blastomeres.</str>

      <str>This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of gene expression induced by activin A in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs). Mouse ES cells cultured in undifferentiated state by leukemia inhibitory factor and feeder layer cells. Following removing these two anti differentiation factors for 5 days and forming Embryoid Bodies (EBs), the cells divided to 8 equal cells per groups. Differentiation procedure was performed in a two staged protocol; Formed EBs for 4 days (Stage one); expanded differentiated ESCs on gelatin coated dishes for one week (stage two). In the stage one, the media of groups 2-7 contained 10, 30 and 100 ng mL(-1) Activin A. The media in stage two was the same for all groups and contained only Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). The expression of undifferentiated, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm markers were compared with relative RT-PCR method and statistically analyzed. The expression of an undifferentiating marker; Nanog was increased in the Activin A treated groups of stage one. The expression of OCT4 reduced in Activin A treated groups in stage two. In the stage one, the expression of Nodal increased by Activin A. expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) was suppressed in Activin A treated groups of both stages. In stage two, there were significant decrease for the expression of mesoderm (Brachyury) and Nodal and visceral endoderm (GATA4) markers (p &lt; 0.01). The expression of definitive endoderm markers (PDX1, TAT) showed significantly increased in Activin A treated groups (p &lt; 0.01). Activin A induced differentiation in high concentration by imbalance in undifferentiating markers. Nodal has a dual role, undifferentiating effect and regulation of visceral endoderm towards definitive endoderm. Overexpression of Nanog, alteration in the expression of Nodal and Shh inhibition are three mechanisms for explanation of differentiation induced by activin A in ES cells. These mechanisms induces cascade of gene expression that commits ESCs towards definitive endodermal cells.</str>

The chordomas have a slow growth and a tendency to infiltrate the adjacent tissues and organs. That makes their surgical treatment difficult.

      <str>We have isolated Cngsc, a hydra homologue of goosecoid gene. The homeodomain of Cngsc is identical to the vertebrate (65-72%) and Drosophila (70%) orthologues. When injected into the ventral side of an early Xenopus embryo, Cngsc induces a partial secondary axis. During head formation, Cngsc expression appears prior to, and directly above, the zone where the tentacles will emerge, but is not observed nearby when the single apical tentacle is formed. This observation indicates that the expression of the gene is not necessary for the formation of a tentacle per se. Rather, it may be involved in defining the border between the hypostome and the tentacle zone. When Cngsc(+) tip of an early bud is grafted into the body column, it induces a secondary axis, while the adjacent Cngsc(-) region has much weaker inductive capacities. Thus, Cngsc is expressed in a tissue that acts as an organizer. Cngsc is also expressed in the sensory neurons of the tip of the hypostome and in the epithelial endodermal cells of the upper part of the body column. The plausible roles of Cngsc in organizer function, head formation and anterior neuron differentiation are similar to roles goosecoid plays in vertebrates and Drosophila. It suggests widespread evolutionary conservation of the function of the gene.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from mice and humans (hESCs) have been shown to be able to efficiently differentiate toward cardiomyocytes (CMs). Because murine ESCs and hESCs do not allow for establishment of pre-clinical allogeneic transplantation models, the aim of our study was to generate functional CMs from rhesus monkey ESCs (rESCs). Although formation of ectodermal and neuronal/glial cells appears to be the default pathway of the rESC line R366.4, we were able to change this commitment and to direct generation of endodermal/mesodermal cells and further differentiation toward CMs. Differentiation of rESCs resulted in an average of 18% of spontaneously contracting embryoid bodies (EBs) from rESCs. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated expression of marker genes typical for endoderm, mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and CMs, including brachyury, goosecoid, Tbx-5, Tbx-20, Mesp1, Nkx2.5, GATA-4, FOG-2, Mlc2a, MLC2v, ANF, and alpha-MHC in rESC-derived CMs. Immunohistological and ultrastructural studies showed expression of CM-typical proteins, including sarcomeric actinin, troponin T, titin, connexin 43, and cross-striated muscle fibrils. Electrophysiological studies by means of multielectrode arrays revealed evidence of functionality, electrical coupling, and beta-adrenergic signaling of the generated CMs. This is the first study demonstrating generation of functional CMs derived from rESCs. In contrast to hESCs, rESCs allow for establishment of pre-clinical allogeneic transplantation models. Moreover, rESC-derived CMs represent a cell source for the development of high-throughput assays for cardiac safety pharmacology.</str>

      <str>Prechordal mesendoderm (PME) is a derivative of gastrula organizer underlying the anterior neural plate of vertebrate embryos. It has been firmly established that PME is critical for head induction and anterior-posterior patterning. Therefore, the establishment of PME in a desired shape and size at a correct position during early embryogenesis is crucial for normal head patterning. However, it remains largely unclear how the desired form and size of PME is generated at a predestined position during early embryogenesis. Here we show that in zebrafish a maternal transcription repressor Vsx1 is essential for this early developmental regulation. Knocking down maternal vsx1 resulted in impaired PME formation and progression associated with a deficient and posteriorized forebrain. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments showed that maternal Vsx1 is essential for repressing ntl ectopic expression in more animal region at early gastrula stages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in combination with core consensus sequence mutation analysis further revealed that maternal Vsx1 can directly repress ntl transcription by binding to the proximal promoter at a specific site. Simultaneous inhibition of ntl function could successfully suppress the defects of both PME and forebrain formation in maternal Vsx1 knockdown embryos. Our results reveal a pivotal role for maternal Vsx1 as a direct transcriptional repressor of ntl expression at the margin of the zebrafish gastrula to ensure directional cell polarization and migration of PME cells. </str>

      <str>All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is an important morphogen involved in many developmental processes, including neural differentiation, body axis formation, and organogenesis. During early embryonic development, atRA is synthesized from all-trans-retinal (atRAL) in an irreversible reaction mainly catalyzed by retinal dehydrogenase 2 (aldh1a2), whereas atRAL is converted from all-trans-retinol via reversible oxidation by retinol dehydrogenases, members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. atRA is degraded by cytochrome P450, family 26 (cyp26). We have previously identified a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 3 (dhrs3), which showed differential expression patterns in Xenopus embryos. We show here that the expression of dhrs3 was induced by atRA treatment and overexpression of Xenopus nodal related 1 (xnr1) in animal cap assay. Overexpression of dhrs3 enhanced the phenotype of excessive cyp26a1. In embryos overexpressing aldh1a2 or retinol dehydrogenase 10 (rdh10) in the presence of their respective substrates, Dhrs3 counteracted the action of Aldh1a2 or Rdh10, indicating that retinoic acid signaling is attenuated. Knockdown of Dhrs3 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in a phenotype of shortened anteroposterior axis, reduced head structure, and perturbed somitogenesis, which were also found in embryos treated with an excess of atRA. Examination of the expression of brachyury, not, goosecoid, and papc indicated that convergent extension movement was defective in Dhrs3 morphants. Taken together, these studies suggest that dhrs3 participates in atRA metabolism by reducing atRAL levels and is required for proper anteroposterior axis formation, neuroectoderm patterning, and somitogenesis. </str>

      <str>Endothelial cells (EC) are important in vasculogenesis and organogenesis during development and in the pathogenesis of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, few EC specification factors are known and primary EC production remains inefficient. Based on recent studies implicating endoglin (Eng) in early vascular development and angiogenesis, we hypothesized that Eng may be an EC specification gene. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) were treated with recombinant Eng or a plasmid expressing the Eng ORF, and differentiated in the presence or absence of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). Expression of the mesoderm and EC marker genes, the known mediators of EC specification and their downstream targets was monitored by quantitative PCR, western blot, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Functionality of the differentiated EC was assessed by in vitro angiogenesis assay and the induction of Icam1 expression in response to TNF-α treatment. Both recombinant Eng and forced Eng expression increased the number of functional EC expressing the EC marker genes VE-cadherin, vWF, and Tie2, and enhanced the effect of BMP4. The Eng-induced EC differentiation was independent of known mediators of EC specification such as Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and BMP4 or of BMP4/Smad1/5/8 signaling. These studies suggest that Eng is a novel EC specification gene.</str>

      <str>Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to be a useful tool for silencing genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio), while the blocking specificity of dsRNA is still of major concern for application. It was reported that siRNA (small interfering RNA) prepared by endoribonuclease digestion (esiRNA) could efficiently silence endogenous gene expression in mammalian embryos. To test whether esiRNA could work in zebrafish, we utilized Escherichia coli RNaseIII to digest dsRNA of zebrafish no tail (ntl), a mesoderm determinant in zebrafish and found that esi-ntl could lead to developmental defects, however, the effective dose was so close to the toxic dose that esi-ntl often led to non-specific developmental defects. Consequently, we utilized SP6 RNA polymerase to produce si-ntl, siRNA designed against ntl, by in vitro transcription. By injecting in vitro synthesized si-ntl into zebrafish zygotes, we obtained specific phenocopies of reported mutants of ntl. We achieved up to a 59%no tail phenotype when the injection concentration was as high as 4 microg/microL. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis showed that si-ntl could largely and specifically reduce mRNA levels of the ntl gene. As a result, our data indicate that esiRNA is unable to cause specific developmental defects in zebrafish, while siRNA should be an alternative for downregulation of specific gene expression in zebrafish in cases where RNAi techniques are applied to zebrafish reverse genetics.</str>

Among them, FGF-10 induced cardiomyocyte differentiation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. FGF-10 neutralizing antibody, small molecule FGF receptor antagonist PD173074 and FGF-10 and FGF receptor-2 short hairpin RNAs inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation. FGF-10 also increased mouse iPS cell differentiation into cardiomyocyte lineage, and this effect was abolished by FGF-10 neutralizing antibody or PD173074. Following Gene Ontology analysis, microarray data indicated that genes involved in cardiac development were upregulated after FGF-10 treatment.

      <str>Mouse embryonic stem cells remain pluripotent when maintained in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Upon LIF withdrawal, most cells differentiate into various lineages, while some die by apoptosis within 3 days. We have analyzed the activation pattern of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families and characterized the expression profile of selected genes modulated during differentiation or apoptosis. We show that p38 MAPKs are activated first, during the apoptotic crisis, while extracellular-regulated kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases are induced after the apoptotic crisis in differentiated cells. However, by using both p38 kinase inhibitors (PD169316 and SB203580) and a p38alpha(-/-) cell line, we demonstrate that p38alpha activation is rather a consequence than a cause of apoptosis. We thus reveal novel properties of PD169316, which induces cell survival without impairing cell differentiation, and identify PD169316-sensitive targets like the fibroblast growth factor-5, Brachyury and bcl-2 genes. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of the PD169316 - regulated bcl-2 gene prevents LIF withdrawal - induced cell death.</str>

      <str>Xenopus nuclear factor 7 (xnf7) is a maternally expressed nuclear protein that is retained in the cytoplasm from oocyte maturation until the midblastula transition (MBT). Mutations of the xnf7 phosphorylation sites to glutamic acids (dnxnf7) resulted in the retention of the endogenous protein in the cytoplasm past the MBT, indicating that cytoplasmic retention is a phosphorylation dependent process. In addition, dnxnf7 acted as a dominant negative mutant by keeping the endogenous xnf7 protein in the cytoplasm past the MBT. Overexpression of dnxnf7 in future dorsal blastomeres resulted in a ventralized or posteriorized phenotype in which the embryos lacked anterior structures, while overexpression in ventral blastomeres resulted in dorsalized embryos. dnxnf7 also affected the expression of both dorsal and ventral mesodermal markers. These data suggest that xnf7 functions in dorsal/ventral patterning and that the movement of the protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the MBT is critical for the execution of a genetic program conferring a dorsal or ventral identity to the mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Previous studies have implicated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in limb development. However, the precise nature and complexity of its role have not been defined. Here, we dissect Fgfr1 function in mouse limb by conditional inactivation of Fgfr1 using two different Cre recombinase-expressing lines. Use of the T (brachyury)-cre line led to Fgfr1 inactivation in all limb bud mesenchyme (LBM) cells during limb initiation. This mutant reveals FGFR1 function in two phases of limb development. In a nascent limb bud, FGFR1 promotes the length of the proximodistal (PD) axis while restricting the dimensions of the other two axes. It also serves an unexpected role in limiting LBM cell number in this early phase. Later on during limb outgrowth, FGFR1 is essential for the expansion of skeletal precursor population by maintaining cell survival. Use of mice carrying the sonic hedgehog(cre) (Shh(cre)) allele led to Fgfr1 inactivation in posterior LBM cells. This mutant allows us to test the role of Fgfr1 in gene expression regulation without disturbing limb bud growth. Our data show that during autopod patterning, FGFR1 influences digit number and identity, probably through cell-autonomous regulation of Shh expression. Our study of these two Fgfr1 conditional mutants has elucidated the multiple roles of FGFR1 in limb bud establishment, growth and patterning.</str>

      <str>T-box genes encode a family of transcription factors having conserved DNA-binding domains and diverged transcription regulatory domains, and each family member shows a specific expression pattern and plays a specific and crucial role in animal development. Two fundamental questions to be answered are whether the T-box gene functional specificity is located in the DNA-binding domain or in the transcription regulatory domain and how the specific expression of T-box genes is controlled. In the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, Brachyury (HrBra) is expressed only in notochord cells while Tbx6 (HrTbx6) is expressed in muscle cells. In the present study, we made chimeric constructs of the two genes to determine the above mentioned questions. Our results suggest that the functional specificity of these two ascidian T-box genes is associated with the DNA-binding domain but not with the transcription regulatory domain. The 5' flanking region of both HrBra and HrTbx6 contains T-protein binding motifs near their minimal promoters that are associated with the autoregulative activation of these genes. Using the chimeric constructs, we also determined whether the autoregulative activity is mediated by the DNA-binding domain or by the transcription activation domain of the gene products. Our results suggest that the autoregulative activity of these two ascidian T-box genes is also mediated by the DNA-binding domain, not by the transcription activation domain of the encoded proteins.</str>

      <str>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potentially inexhaustible source of cells for replacement therapy. However, successful preclinical and clinical progress requires efficient and controlled differentiation towards the specific differentiated cell fate.</str>
      <str>We previously developed a strategy to generate blast cells (BCs) from hESCs that were capable of differentiating into vascular structures as well as into all hematopoietic cell lineages. Although the BCs were shown to repair damaged vasculature in multiple animal models, the large-scale generation of cells under these conditions was challenging. Here we report a simpler and more efficient method for robust generation of hemangioblastic progenitors.</str>
      <str>In addition to eliminating several expensive factors that are unnecessary, we demonstrate that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 and VEGF are necessary and sufficient to induce hemangioblastic commitment and development from hESCs during early stages of differentiation. BMP-4 and VEGF significantly upregulate T-brachyury, KDR, CD31 and Lmo2 gene expression, while dramatically downregulating Oct-4 expression. The addition of basic FGF during growth and expansion was found to further enhance BC development, consistently generating approximately 1 x 10(8) BCs from one six well plate of hESCs.</str>

      <str>A detailed analysis of the gastrulating chick embryo was performed using three methods : time-lapse videotaping of embryos in culture, histological semithin sections, and in situ hybridization with 10 mRNA signals expressed during gastrulation. The results suggest that the gene expression pattern of Goosecoid, Hex, Crescent, and Bmp7 may be involved in the axial establishment of the temporal and spatial arrangement of cells forming the prechordal plate endoderm, and that Chordin, cNot1, Noggin, and Brachyury are precocious markers of cells coming from Hensen's node, which contribute to the rostralmost tip of the notochord, its arrowhead, the head process, and, later, the elongating notochord. These results explain several earlier descriptions based only on morphological analyses of the axial mesodermal structures characteristic of the gastrulation stages. The data, carefully observed and compared with the whole-mount observation in time-lapse video, show that the changes in cell populations, movements, and cell differentiation occur step-by-step over a precise temporal range, which requires the establishment of a subdivision of the stages usually employed. Knowledge of new aspects of avian gastrulation, including gene expression patterns, immunocytochemical analyses, and the great number of recent experiments based on microinjections or transplants of groups of cells to analyze processes of induction or regulation, need the support of a precisely defined scheme of primitive streak stages (PS-stages), and a correlation of these stages with other approaches to provide a finer resolution of the staging steps, and thus to facilitate a better understanding of the initial gastrulation period.</str>

      <str>DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, conotruncal anomaly face syndrome, and isolated and familial forms of conotruncal cardiac defects have been associated with deletions of chromosomal region 22q11.2. This report describes the identification, cloning, and characterization of the human TBX1 gene, which maps to the center of the DiGeorge chromosomal region. Further, we have extended the mouse cDNA sequence to permit comparisons between human and mouse Tbx1. TBX1 is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes are transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. There is 98% amino acid identity between human and mouse TBX1 proteins overall, and within the T-box domain, the proteins are identical except for two amino acids. Expression of human TBX1 in adult and fetal tissues, as determined by Northern blot analysis, is similar to that found in the mouse. Additionally, using 3 'RACE, we obtained a differentially spliced message in adult skeletal muscle. Mouse Tbx1 has been previously shown to be expressed during early embryogenesis in the pharyngeal arches, pouches, and otic vesicle. Later in development, expression is seen in the vertebral column and tooth bud. Thus, human TBX1 is a candidate for some of the features seen in the 22q11 deletion syndrome.</str>

      <str>In embryos of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, the competence of isolated presumptive notochord blastomeres to respond to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) for induction of the primary notochord decays by 1 hour after cleavage from the 32- to 64-cell stage. This study analyzes the molecular mechanisms responsible for this loss of competence and provides evidence for a novel mechanism. A forkhead family transcription factor, FoxB, plays a role in competence decay by preventing the induction of notochord-specific Brachyury (Bra) gene expression by the FGF/MAPK signaling pathway. Unlike the mechanisms reported previously in other animals, no component in the FGF signal transduction cascade appeared to be lost or inactivated at the time of competence loss. Knockdown of FoxB functions allowed the isolated cells to retain their competence for a longer period, and to respond to FGF with expression of Bra beyond the stage at which competence was normally lost. FoxB acts as a transcription repressor by directly binding to the cis-regulatory element of the Bra gene. Our results suggest that FoxB prevents ectopic induction of the notochord fate within the cells that assume a default nerve cord fate, after the stage when notochord induction has been completed. The merit of this system is that embryos can use the same FGF signaling cascade again for another purpose in the same cell lineage at later stages by keeping the signaling cascade itself available. Temporally and spatially regulated FoxB expression in nerve cord cells was promoted by the ZicN transcription factor and absence of FGF/MAPK signaling.</str>

      <str>Since induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have differentiation potential into all three germ layer-derived tissues, efficient purification of target cells is required in many fields of iPS research. One useful strategy is isolation of desired cells from differentiated iPS cells by lineage-specific expression of a drug-resistance gene, followed by drug selection. With this strategy, we purified neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs), a good candidate source for regenerative therapy, from differentiated mouse iPS cells. We constructed a bicistronic expression vector simultaneously expressing blasticidin S resistance gene and DsRed under the control of tandem enhancer of a 257-base pair region of nestin second intron, an NSC-specific enhancer. This construct was efficiently inserted into the iPS genome by piggyBac transposon-mediated gene transfer, and the established subclone was differentiated into NSCs in the presence or absence of blasticidin S. Consequently, incubation with blasticidin S led to purification of NSCs from differentiated iPS cells. Our results suggest that a lineage-specific drug selection strategy is useful for purification of NSCs from differentiated iPS cells and that this strategy can be applied for the purification of other cell types.</str>

      <str>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intracellular messenger in several cell systems, but its contribution to embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology has not been characterized. Exposure of ESCs to low concentrations (2-20 μM) of the NO donor diethylenetriamine NO adduct confers protection from apoptosis elicited by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. NO blocked caspase 3 activation, PARP degradation, downregulation of the pro-apoptotic genes Casp7, Casp9, Bax and Bak1 and upregulation of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 111, Bcl-2 and Birc6. These effects were also observed in cells overexpressing eNOS. Exposure of LIF-deprived mESCs to low NO prevented the loss of expression of self-renewal genes (Oct4, Nanog and Sox2) and the SSEA marker. Moreover, NO blocked the differentiation process promoted by the absence of LIF and bFGF in mouse and human ESCs. NO treatment decreased the expression of differentiation markers, such as Brachyury, Gata6 and Gata4. Constitutive overexpression of eNOS in cells exposed to LIF deprivation maintained the expression of self-renewal markers, whereas the differentiation genes were repressed. These effects were reversed by addition of the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA. Altogether, the data suggest that low NO has a role in the regulation of ESC differentiation by delaying the entry into differentiation, arresting the loss of self-renewal markers and promoting cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis.</str>

Furthermore, the expression of pluripotency (cPouV, Sox2, and Nanog) and cell lineage specific (Cvh, Brachyury, and Gata6) gene markers was evaluated at the level of mRNA using quantitative RT-PCR. Isolated cells were passaged repeatedly and successfully up to ten passages. The stemness of embryonic cells has been approved by the activity of the alkaline phosphatase, presence of the SSEA-4, and TRA-1-60 protein, and expression of the molecular marker (cPouV, Nanog, and Sox-2) genes. The spontaneous differentiation of chicken ESCs confirmed the pluripotecy of the cells in differentiation into specialized cell lineages.

      <str>Activation of transforming growth factor beta receptors causes the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins, which then participate in the regulation of expression of target genes. We describe a novel Smad-interacting protein, SIP1, which was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system. Although SIP1 interacts with the MH2 domain of receptor-regulated Smads in yeast and in vitro, its interaction with full-length Smads in mammalian cells requires receptor-mediated Smad activation. SIP1 is a new member of the deltaEF1/Zfh-1 family of two-handed zinc finger/homeodomain proteins. Like deltaEF1, SIP1 binds to 5'-CACCT sequences in different promoters, including the Xenopus brachyury promoter. Overexpression of either full-length SIP1 or its C-terminal zinc finger cluster, which bind to the Xbra2 promoter in vitro, prevented expression of the endogenous Xbra gene in early Xenopus embryos. Therefore, SIP1, like deltaEF1, is likely to be a transcriptional repressor, which may be involved in the regulation of at least one immediate response gene for activin-dependent signal transduction pathways. The identification of this Smad-interacting protein opens new routes to investigate the mechanisms by which transforming growth factor beta members exert their effects on expression of target genes in responsive cells and in the vertebrate embryo.</str>

In control and scl-null embryoid bodies the temporal expression pattern of genes associated with the formation of ventral mesoderm, such as Brachyury, bone morphogenetic protein-4, and flk-1, was identical. Similarly, GATA-2, CD34, and c-kit, which are coexpressed in endothelial and hematopoietic lineages, were expressed normally in scl-null embryonic stem cell lines. However, hematopoietic-restricted genes, including the transcription factors GATA-1, EKLF, and PU.1 as well as globin genes and myeloperoxidase, were only expressed in wild-type and scl-heterozygous embryonic stem cells. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to confirm the observations that GATA-1 and globins were only present in control embryoid bodies but that CD34 was found on both control and scl-null embryoid bodies.

The immortalized tumor derived rat fibroblast TRF-O3 cells isolated from a Dnd1-deficient teratoma were identified as optimal feeder cells supporting stemness and proliferation of rat ESC. The TRF-O3 cells were characterized as myofibroblasts by expression of fibroblast specific genes alpha-2 type I collagen, collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha (II), vimentin, S100A4, and smooth muscle α-actin. Culture of inner cell masses (ICM) derived from WKY/Ztm rat blastocysts in 2i-LIF medium on TRF-O3 feeder cells lacking LIF, SCF and FGF2 expression resulted in pluripotent and germ-line competent rat ESC lines. Therein, genotyping confirmed up to 26% male ESC lines. On the other hand the TRF-O3 specific BMP4 expression was correlated with transcriptional activity of the mesodermal marker T-brachyury and the ectoderm specific nestin in the ESC line ES21 demonstrating mesodermal or ectodermal cell lineage differentiation processes within the ESC population. Substitution of 2i-LIF by serum-containing YPAC medium supplemented with TGF-β and rho kinase inhibitors or by 4i medium in combination with TRF-O3 feeder cells led to enhanced differentiation of ES21 cells and freshly isolated ICMs. These results suggest that the ESC culture conditions using TRF-O3 feeder cells and 2i-LIF medium supported the establishment of male ESC lines from WKY/Ztm rats, which represent a favored, permissive genetic background for rat ESC culture. </str>

Conversely, late antagonism of endogenously produced Wnts enhanced cardiogenesis, indicating a biphasic role for the pathway in human cardiac differentiation. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we show that canonical Wnt ligand expression is induced by activin A/BMP4 treatment, and the extent of early Wnt ligand expression can predict the subsequent efficiency of cardiogenesis. Measurement of Brachyury expression showed that addition of Wnt3a enhances mesoderm induction, whereas blockade of endogenously produced Wnts markedly inhibits mesoderm formation. Finally, we show that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is required for Smad1 activation by BMP4.</str>

      <str>2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) causes abnormalities during heart development. Cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells are a robust model for the study of early cardiomyogenesis. Here, we evaluated the effects of TCDD at key stages during the differentiation of mouse ES cells into cardiomyocytes analysing: (i) the transcription of lineage differentiation (Brachyury, Nkx-2.5, Actc-1), cardiac-specific (Alpk3, cTnT, cTnI, cTnC) and detoxification phase I (Cyp1A1, Cyp1A2 and Cyp1B1) and phase II (Nqo1, Gsta1 and Ugt1a6) genes; (ii) the global gene expression; (iii) the ultrastructure of ES-derived cardiomyocytes; (iv) level of ATP production and (v) the immunolocalisation of sarcomeric α-actinin, β-myosin heavy chain and cTnT proteins. We show that TCDD affects the differentiation of ES cells into cardiomyocytes at several levels: (1) induces the expression of phase I genes; (2) down-regulates a group of heart-specific genes, some involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway; (3) reduces the efficiency of differentiation; (4) alters the arrangement of mitochondria, that show twisted and disrupted cristae, and of some sarcomeres, with misalignement or disarrangement of the myofibrillar organisation and (5) reduces ATP production. This study provides novel evidences that TCDD impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation. Sarcomeres and mitochondria could be a target for dioxin toxicity, their disruption representing a possible mechanism developing cardiac injury.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate in vivo and in vitro into all cell lineages, and they have been proposed as cellular therapy for human diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling ESC commitment toward specific lineages need to be specified. We previously found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathway inhibits neurogenesis and is necessary to mesodermal formation during the critical first 5 days of mouse ESC commitment. This period corresponds to the expression of specific master genes that direct ESC into each of the three embryonic layers. By both chemical and genetic approaches, we found now that, during this phase, the p38MAPK pathway stabilizes the p53 protein level and that interfering directly with p53 mimics the effects of p38MAPK inhibition on ESC differentiation. Anti-p53 siRNA transient transfections stimulate Bcl2 and Pax6 gene expressions, leading to increased ESC neurogenesis compared with control transfections. Conversely, p53 downregulation leads to a strong inhibition of the mesodermal master genes Brachyury and Mesp1 affecting cardiomyogenesis and skeletal myogenesis of ESCs. Similar results were found with p53(-/-) ESCs compared with their wild-type counterparts. In addition, knockout p53 ESCs show impaired smooth muscle cell and adipocyte formation. Use of anti-Nanog siRNAs demonstrates that certain of these regulations result partially to p53-dependent repression of Nanog gene expression. In addition to its well-known role in DNA-damage response, apoptosis, cell cycle control and tumor suppression, p53 has also been involved in vivo in embryonic development; our results show now that p53 mediates, at least for a large part, the p38MAPK control of the early commitment of ESCs toward mesodermal and neural lineages.</str>

      <str>Endoderm formation in the mammal is a complex process with two lineages forming during the first weeks of development, the primitive (or extraembryonic) endoderm, which is specified in the blastocyst, and the definitive endoderm that forms later, at gastrulation, as one of the germ layers of the embryo proper. Fate mapping evidence suggests that the definitive endoderm arises as two waves, which potentially reflect two distinct cell populations. Early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cell differentiation has been used successfully to identify and characterise mechanisms regulating molecular gastrulation and lineage choice during differentiation. The roles of the p38 MAPK family in the formation of definitive endoderm were investigated using EPL cells and chemical inhibitors of p38 MAPK activity. These approaches define a role for p38 MAPK activity in the formation of the primitive streak and a second role in the formation of the definitive endoderm. Characterisation of the definitive endoderm populations formed from EPL cells demonstrates the formation of two distinct populations, defined by gene expression and ontogeny, that were analogous to the proximal and distal definitive endoderm populations of the embryo. Formation of the proximal definitive endoderm was found to require p38 MAPK activity and is correlated with molecular gastrulation, defined by the expression of brachyury (T). Distal definitive endoderm formation also requires p38 MAPK activity but can form when T expression is inhibited. Understanding lineage complexity will be a prerequisite for the generation of endoderm derivatives for commercial and clinical use. </str>

In the present study, we used a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven DNA template approach to induce short hairpin RNA (shRNA) triggered RNAi to block exogenous Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) and endogenous No Tail (NTL) gene expressions. We constructed three plasmids, pCMV-EGFP-CMV-shGFP-SV40, pCMV-EGFP-CMV-shNTL-SV40, and pCMV-EGFP-CMV-shScrambled-SV40, each containing a CMV promoter driving an EGFP reporter cDNA and DNA coding for one shRNA under the control of another CMV promoter. The three shRNA-generating plasmids and pCMV-EGFP control plasmid were introduced into zebrafish embryos by microinjection. Samples were collected at 48 h after injection. Results were evaluated by phenotype observation and real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). The shGFP-generating plasmid significantly inhibited the EGFP expression viewed under fluorescent microscope and reduced by 70.05 +/- 1.26% of exogenous EGFP gene mRNA levels compared with controls by Q-PCR. The shRNA targeting endogenous NTL gene resulted in obvious NTL phenotype of 30 +/- 4% and decreased the level of their corresponding mRNAs up to 54.52 +/- 2.05% compared with nontargeting control shRNA. These data proved the feasibility of the CMV promoter-driven shRNA expression technique to be used to inhibit exogenous and endogenous gene expressions in zebrafish in vivo.</str>

      <str>Methodologies to reprogram somatic cells into patient-specific pluripotent cells, which could potentially be used in personalized drug discovery and cell replacement therapies, are currently under development. Oct4 activation is essential for successful reprogramming and pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells, albeit molecular details of Oct4 activation are not completely understood. Here we report that endogenous SAF-A is involved in regulation of Oct4 expression, binds the Oct4 proximal promoter in ES cells, and dissociates from the promoter upon early differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal. Depletion of SAF-A decreases Oct4 expression even in the presence of LIF, and results in an increase of the mesodermal marker Brachyury. The overexpression of wild-type human SAF-A rescues the mouse knock-down phenotype and results in increased Oct4 level. We also demonstrate that endogenous SAF-A interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of endogenous RNA polymerase II and that the interaction is independent of CTD phosphorylation and mRNA. Moreover, we show that SAF-A exist in complexes with transcription factors Sox2 and Oct4 as well as STAT3 in ES cells. The number of endogenous SAF-A:Oct4 and SAF-A:Sox2 complexes decreases upon LIF depletion. These discoveries allow us to propose a model for activation of Oct4 transcription.</str>

      <str>Pluripotent embryonic stem cells hold a great promise as an unlimited source of tissue for treatment of chronic diseases such as Type 1 diabetes. Herein, we describe a protocol using all-trans-retinoic acid, basic fibroblast growth factor and dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) in the absence of embryoid body formation, for differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into definitive endoderm that may serve as pancreatic precursors. The produced cells were analyzed by quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and static insulin release assay for markers of trilaminar embryo, and pancreas. Differentiated cells displayed increased Sox17 and Foxa2 expression consistent with definitive endoderm production. There was minimal production of Sox7, an extraembryonic endoderm marker, and Oct4, a marker of pluripotency. There was minimal mesoderm or neuroectoderm formation based on expression levels of the markers brachyury and Sox1, respectively. Various assays revealed that the cell clusters generated by this protocol express markers of the pancreatic lineage including insulin I, insulin II, C-peptide, PDX-1, carboxypeptidase E, pan-cytokeratin, amylase, glucagon, PAX6, Ngn3 and Nkx6.1.

      <str>We compared the ability of hES cells and iPS cells derived from human epidermal keratinocytes to progressively differentiate into pancreatic endoderm. Human foreskin keratinocytes were reprogrammed to pluripotency by transduction with retroviruses encoding Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4. The resulting keratinocyte-derived iPS (KiPS) cell lines and a hES cell line were subjected to a modified pancreatic endoderm differentiation protocol. Cells and embryoid-body structures derived from both hES and KiPS cells were compared at different stages of development for expression of stem cell and differentiation markers, including Sox2, Oct4, Mixl1, Brachyury, Gsc, FoxA2, Sox17, Hnf4α, Hnf1β, Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, Hex, Isl1, Pdx1, and Slc2A, via Taqman real-time PCR, flow-cytometry, and/or immunocytochemistry.</str>
      <str>hES cells and KiPS cells expressed similar levels of the stem cell factors Sox2 and Oct4. Upon differentiation, both cell types underwent remarkably similar changes in gene expression. They acquired the definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and FoxA2. Most Sox17+ and FoxA2+ cells co-expressed Hnf4α and Hnf1β, found in the primitive gut tube, a pancreas precursor. Most FoxA2+ cells were also Pdx1+, and many expressed Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, and Isl1.</str>

      <str>The endoderm forms the gut and associated organs, and develops from a layer of cells which emerges during gastrula stages in the vertebrate embryo. In comparison to mesoderm and ectoderm, little is known about the signals which induce the endoderm. The origin of the endoderm is intimately linked with that of mesoderm, both by their position in the embryo, and by the molecules that can induce them. We characterised a gene, zebrafish gata5, which is expressed in the endoderm from blastula stages and show that its transcription is induced by signals originating from the yolk cell. These signals also induce the mesoderm-expressed transcription factor no tail (ntl), whose initial expression coincides with gata5 in the cells closest to the blastoderm margin, then spreads to encompass the germ ring. We have characterised the induction of these genes and show that ectopic expression of activin induces gata5 and ntl in a pattern which mimics the endogenous expression, while expression of a dominant negative activin receptor abolishes ntl and gata5 expression. Injection of RNA encoding a constitutively active activin receptor leads to ectopic expression of gata5 and ntl. gata5 is activated cell-autonomously, whereas ntl is induced in cells distant from those which have received the RNA, showing that although expression of both genes is induced by a TGF-beta signal, expression of ntl then spreads by a relay mechanism. Expression of a fibroblast growth factor (eFGF) or a dominant negatively acting FGF receptor shows that ntl but not gata5 is regulated by FGF signalling, implying that this may be the relay signal leading to the spread of ntl expression. In embryos lacking both squint and cyclops, members of the nodal group of TGF-beta related molecules, gata5 expression in the blastoderm is abolished, making these factors primary candidates for the endogenous TGF-beta signal inducing gata5.</str>

The expression of organizer-related genes was investigated during the mesodermalizing process of the mE. The expression of C. pyrrhogaster organizer-related genes, such as bra, gsc, lim-1, chd and noggin, were analyzed. Cynops pyrrhogaster shh expression was also investigated. The organizer-related genes were activated by 12 h after the mesoderm-inducing stimulus. It was noted that there was a temporal gap in the expression of each gene. The expression of bra and gsc seemed to be more quickly activated during the mesodermalizing process. While expression of lim-1 and noggin was activated later than that of bra and gsc, lim-1 expression was earlier than chd and noggin expression. Shh expression was activated later than lim-1/noggin. The present study suggests the possibility that the bra/gsc, lim-1, chd, noggin and shh genes are expressed one by one in that order during the mesodermalizing of the presumptive ectoderm. It also indicates that the sequence is not always consistent with that of the whole embryo during normal embryogenesis.

      <str>The notch signaling pathway is widely conserved from vertebrates to invertebrates and mediates the specification of numerous cell fates during developmental processes. In the Xenopus gastrula embryo, Xdelta1, one of the Notch ligands, is expressed in the prospective mesoderm prior to Xbra expression. Here, we examined the role of Notch signaling in mesoderm formation. Embryos injected with Xdelta1 morpholino oligo DNA showed a severe gastrulation defect and suppression of Xbra expression, which were completely rescued by co-injection with the active form of Notch. In order to fully understand the role of Notch signaling, we examined the expression of the Notch target genes XESR1 and XESR5. RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses showed that XESR5 was highly expressed in the marginal zone of the early gastrula embryo, whereas expression of XESR1 was not detected. Animal cap assays indicated that expression of XESR5 was not induced by Notch signaling but by nodal signaling. To clarify the role of XESR5 in the gastrula embryo, a dominant negative form of XESR5 was injected into the prospective mesoderm. The truncated form of XESR5 induced the ectopic expression of XESR1, which caused a decrease in Xbra expression and defective gastrulation. In contrast, the truncated form of XESR1 caused an upregulation of XESR5 resulting in an increase in Xbra expression. The antagonistic effect of XESR1 and XESR5 suggests a dual regulation in which XESR5 produces a competent area for mesoderm formation by suppressing the gene expression of XESR1, while XESR1 sharpens the boundary of Xbra expression.</str>

      <str>During embryonic development, signalling molecules known as morphogens act in a concentration-dependent manner to provide positional information to responding tissues. In the early zebrafish embryo, graded signalling by members of the nodal family induces the formation of mesoderm and endoderm, thereby patterning the embryo into three germ layers. Nodal signalling has also been implicated in the establishment of the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo. Although one can infer the existence of nodal gradients by comparing gene expression patterns in wild-type embryos and embryos in which nodal signalling is diminished or augmented, real understanding can only come from directly observing the gradients. One approach is to determine local ligand concentrations in the embryo, but this is technically challenging, and the presence of inhibitors might cause the effective concentration of a ligand to differ from its actual concentration. We have therefore taken two approaches to visualise a direct response to nodal signalling. In the first, we have used transgenic embryos to study the nuclear accumulation of a Smad2-Venus fusion protein, and in the second we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualise the formation of a complex between Smad2 and Smad4. This has allowed us to visualise, in living embryos, the formation of a graded distribution of nodal signalling activity. We have quantified the formation of the gradient in time and space, and our results not only confirm that nodal signalling patterns the embryo into three germ layers, but also shed light on its role in patterning the dorso-ventral axis and highlight unexpected complexities of mesodermal patterning.</str>

Immunophenotype analysis of HAM cells revealed the presence of antigens for SSEA-3, SSEA-4, collagen type-I, -II, -III, -IV, -XII, fibronectin, alpha-SMA, vimentin, desmin, cytokeratin18 (CK18), HCAM-1, fibroblast surface protein, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ABC. ICAM-1 protein was weakly detectable, and proteins of TRA-1-60, VCAM-1, von Willebrand factor, PECAM-1, and HLA DR were not detected. HAM cells reached senescence after 14.5+/-0.9 passages, over a period of 146.8+/-8.9 days, and underwent an average of 36.9 4.7 population doublings. RT-PCR analysis showed that all four HAM cell lines consistently expressed genes of Oct-4, Rex-1, SCF, NCAM, nestin, BMP-4, GATA-4, HNF-4alpha, vimentin, and CK18, regardless of the passage number. The genes of Brachyury, FGF-5, Pax-6, and BMP2 were never expressed. Strikingly, alpha-fetoprotein (alphaFP), HLA ABC, and HLA DR genes were expressed in an earlier passage but not expressed in later passages. Telomerase activity of two HAM lines was discernable upon the third passage.

      <str>The appearance of bottle cells at the dorsal vegetal/marginal boundary of Xenopus embryos marks the onset of blastopore formation. The conditions leading to this epithelial activity were investigated by inducing bottle cells ectopically in the animal region with VegT or different members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family. Morphological studies on the ectopic bottle cells indicate their close similarity to the endogenous bottle cells at the dorsal blastopore lip. The subepithelial cells of the induced animal region express mesodermal genes in a pattern reminiscent to that observed on the dorsal lip. Relating this expression pattern to the position of the ectopic bottle cells leads to the conclusion that bottle cells form in regions of high TGF-beta signalling. The specific inhibitory effects of cerberus on ectopically induced bottle cells revealed that nodal related growth factors are the intrinsic signals that elicit bottle cell formation in the normal embryo. In addition, fibroblast growth factor signalling is an essential precondition for this epithelial response as it is for mesoderm formation. We conclude that bottle cell formation in the epithelial layer of the gastrula is closely linked to mesodermal patterning in the subepithelial tissues.</str>

      <str>MACF1 (microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1) is a multidomain protein that can associate with microfilaments and microtubules. We found that MACF1 was highly expressed in neuronal tissues and the foregut of embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) embryos and the head fold and primitive streak of E7.5 embryos. MACF1(-/-) mice died at the gastrulation stage and displayed developmental retardation at E7.5 with defects in the formation of the primitive streak, node, and mesoderm. This phenotype was similar to Wnt-3(-/-) and LRP5/6 double-knockout embryos. In the absence of Wnt, MACF1 associated with a complex that contained Axin, beta-catenin, GSK3beta, and APC. Upon Wnt stimulation, MACF1 appeared to be involved in the translocation and subsequent binding of the Axin complex to LRP6 at the cell membrane. Reduction of MACF1 with small interfering RNA decreased the amount of beta-catenin in the nucleus, and led to an inhibition of Wnt-induced TCF/beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation. Similar results were obtained with a dominant-negative MACF1 construct that contained the Axin-binding region. Reduction of MACF1 in Wnt-1-expressing P19 cells resulted in decreased T (Brachyury) gene expression, a DNA-binding transcription factor that is a direct target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and required for mesoderm formation.

During embryonic development, Cr-1 is expressed in the mouse blastocyst, primitive streak, and later is restricted to the developing heart. To investigate the role of Cr-1, we have generated Cr-1-negative embryonic stem (ES) cell lines by homologous recombination. The resulting double "knockout" ES cells have selectively lost the ability to form beating cardiac myocytes, a process that can be rescued by reintroducing Cr-1 gene back into the Cr(-/-) cells. Furthermore, the lack of functional Cr-1 is correlated with absence of expression of cardiac-specific myosin light and heavy chain genes during differentiation. Differentiation into other cell types including skeletal muscle is not disrupted. These results suggest that Cr-1 is essential for contractile cardiomyocyte formation in vitro.</str>

      <str>We have examined the role of MAP kinase during mesoderm induction and axial patterning in Xenopus embryos. MAP Kinase Phosphatase (MKP-1) was used to inactivate endogenous MAP kinase and was found to prevent the induction of early and late mesodermal markers by both FGF and activin. In whole embryos, MKP-1 was found to disrupt posterior axial patterning, generating a phenotype similar to that obtained with a dominant inhibitory FGF receptor. Overexpression of either constitutively active MAP kinase or constitutively active MAP kinase (MEK) was sufficient to induce Xbra expression, while only constitutively active MEK was able to significantly induce expression of muscle actin. When MAP kinase phosphorylation was used as a sensitive marker of FGF receptor activity in vivo, this activity was found to persist at a low and relatively uniform level throughout blastula stage embryos. The finding that a low level of MAP kinase phosphorylation exists in unstimulated animal caps and is absent in caps overexpressing a dominant inhibitory FGF receptor provides a basis for our previous observation that overexpression of this receptor inhibits activin induction. These results indicate that FGF-dependent MAP kinase activity plays a critical role in establishing the responsiveness of embryonic tissues to mesoderm inducers.</str>

      <str>The homeobox transcription factor tinman is essential for heart vessel formation in Drosophila. In contrast, mice lacking the murine homologue Nkx2-5 are defective in cardiac looping but not in cardiac myocyte development. The lack of an essential role for Nkx2-5 in cardiomyogenesis in mammalian systems is most likely the result of genetic redundancy with family members. In this study, we used a dominant negative mutant of Nkx2-5, created by fusing the repressor domain of engrailed 2 to the Nkx2-5 homeodomain, termed Nkx/EnR. Expression of Nkx/EnR inhibited Me(2)SO-induced cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells but not skeletal myogenesis. Nkx/EnR inhibited expression of cardiomyoblast markers, such as GATA-4 and MEF2C, but not of mesoderm markers, such as Brachyury T and Wnt5b, or of skeletal lineage markers, such as MyoD and Mox1. To identify the minimal region of Nkx2-5 that can trigger cardiomyogenesis, we analyzed the activity of various Nkx2-5 deletion mutants. The C-terminal domain was not necessary for the ability of Nkx2-5 to induce cardiomyogenesis and loss of this domain did not enhance myogenesis. Therefore, Nkx2-5 function is essential for commitment of mesoderm into the cardiac muscle lineage, and the N-terminal region, together with the homeodomain, is sufficient for cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells.</str>

      <str>The epithelial versus mesenchymal phenotypes of embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm cells of the prestreak stage pig embryos were examined by electron microscopy and molecular marker analysis. During this period the embryonic disc remained flat or slightly convex while becoming oval or pyriform in shape. Mesenchyme cells expressing vimentin were present between the embryonic disc and the underlying visceral endoderm before a primitive streak (or groove) was apparent. The migration of mesenchyme appeared to occur in lateral and posterior directions from a mass of quiescent cells located in the pointed end of the pyriform embryonic disc that expressed Brachyury; these cells are proposed to be the precursors of the primitive streak and/or form the equivalent of the mouse early gastrula organizer (EGO). Cells with the TEC-1 (or SSEA-1) epitope, the marker most frequently used to characterize pluripotent cells, were initially distributed randomly in the embryonic ectoderm and then were found to localize in an anterior crescent which may contain the precursor cells of ectoderm and neurectoderm. As mitotic figures were found only in the anterior crescent, it is proposed that at least some of these proliferating cells migrate toward the EGO. While cytokeratins were barely detectable in the embryonic ectoderm cells, vimentin expression was supposed to be associated with the migratory capacity of these cells. These findings indicate that the early step of gastrulation, migration of extraembryonic mesoderm, occurs at a prestreak stage during which the embryonic disc becomes polarized. genesis 38:13-25, 2004.</str>

      <str>Like all known LIM class homeobox genes, Xlim-1 encodes a protein with two tandemly repeated cysteine-rich LIM domains upstream of the homeodomain. In Xenopus laevis, Xlim-1 is specifically expressed in the Spemann organizer, whose major functions include neural induction and dorsalization of ventral mesoderm. From RNA injection experiments we conclude here that: (1) the LIM domains behave as negative regulatory domains; (2) LIM domain mutants of Xlim-1 elicited neural differentiation in animal explants; (3) mutant, and to a lesser extent wild-type, Xlim-1 enhanced muscle formation after coinjection with Xbra; (4) both of these activities are mediated by extracellular signals as seen in combined explant experiments; (5) Xlim-1 mutants activated goosecoid (gsc) expression in animal explants, but not expression of noggin or follistatin; (6) mutant Xlim-1 elicited formation of partial secondary axes, and cooperated with gsc in notochord formation. Thus Xlim-1 has latent activities, implicating it in organizer functions.</str>

In this study, we report the effect of a matrix-dependent enrichment of ES cell-derived hepatocytes using immobilized poly(N-p-vinylbenzyl-4-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-D-gluconamide) (PVLA) with E-cadherin-IgG Fc (E-cad-Fc) as a galactose-carrying substratum. PVLA and E-cad-Fc were confirmed to be stably co-adsorbed onto polystyrene surface by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). We showed that the E-cad-Fc/PVLA hybrid substratum was efficient in culturing primary hepatocytes and maintaining liver functions, on which the undifferentiated ES cells also maintained high proliferative capability. Furthermore, ES cell-derived hepatocytes on this hybrid matrix expressed elevated level of liver specific genes and functions together with early expression of definitive hepatocyte marker, asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Finally, we isolated a high percentage of cells (about 60%) with ASGPR expression after re-seeding onto PVLA-coated surface, and observed the elimination of the poorly differentiated cells (Gata6(+) and Sox17(+)) and the ones toward another cell lineage (brachyury(+) and Pdx1(+)). The system uses a glycopolymer as an extracellular substratum for isolation and enrichment of ES cell-derived hepatocytes with adequate homogeneity and functionality.</str>

      <str>Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a member of a growing family of transcription factors that share a common 3 C2H2 zinc finger DNA binding domain and have broad activity in regulating proliferation and development. We have previously established that Klf6 is expressed in neuronal tissue, hindgut, heart, lung, kidney, and limb buds during midgestation. To explore the potential role of Klf6 in mouse development, we analyzed Klf6-/- mice and found that the homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal by embryonic day (E) 12.5 and associated with markedly reduced hematopoiesis and poorly organized yolk sac vascularization. Additionally, mRNA levels of Scl and Gata1 were reduced by approximately 80% in Klf6-/- yolk sacs. To further analyze this phenotype, we generated Klf6-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination, and compared their capacity to differentiate into the hematopoietic lineage with that of either Klf6+/- or Klf6+/+ ES cells. Consistent with the phenotype in the early embryo, Klf6-/- ES cells displayed significant hematopoietic defects following differentiation into EBs. Prolongation of epiblast-like cells and delays in mesoderm induction were also observed in the Klf6-/- EBs, associated with delayed expression of Brachyury, Klf1, and Gata1. Forced expression of KLF6 using a tet-inducible system enhanced the hematopoietic potential of wild-type EBs. Collectively, these findings implicate Klf6 in ES-cell differentiation and hematopoiesis.</str>

      <str>Formation of the primitive streak (PS) is the initial specification step that generates all the mesodermal and endodermal tissue lineages during early differentiation. Thus, a therapeutically compatible and efficient method for differentiation of the PS is crucial for regenerative medicine. In this study, we developed chemically defined serum-free culture conditions for the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into the PS-like cells. Cultures supplemented with Wnt showed induction of expression of a PS marker, the brachyury gene, followed by induction of the anterior PS markers goosecoid and foxa2, a posterior PS marker, evx1, and the endoderm marker sox17. Similar differentiation of PS by Wnt was also observed in human ES cells. Moreover, we revealed that the activation of the Wnt canonical pathway is essential for PS differentiation in mouse ES cells. These results demonstrated that Wnt is an essential and sufficient factor for the induction of the PS-like cells in vitro. These conditions of induction could constitute the initial step in generating therapeutically useful cells of the definitive endoderm lineage, such as hepatocytes and pancreatic endocrine cells, under chemically defined conditions.</str>

      <str>Human umbilical cord blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs), which are capable of multilineage differentiation, are currently under investigation for a number of therapeutic applications. A major obstacle to their clinical use is the fact that in vitro expansion is still dependent upon fetal calf serum, which could be a source of pathogens. In this study, we investigate the capacity of three different stem cell culture media to support USSCs in serum-free conditions; HEScGRO, PSM and USSC growth medium ACF. Our findings demonstrate that USSCs do not grow in HEScGRO or PSM, but we were able to isolate, proliferate and maintain multipotency of three USSC lines in USSC growth medium ACF.</str>
      <str>For the first one to three passages, cells grown in USSC growth medium ACF proliferate and maintain their morphology, but with continued passaging the cells form spherical cell aggregates. Upon dissociation of spheres, cells continue to grow in suspension and form new spheres. Dissociated cells can also revert to monolayer growth when cultured on extracellular matrix support (fibronectin or gelatin), or in medium containing fetal calf serum. Analysis of markers associated with pluripotency (Oct4 and Sox2) and differentiation (FoxA2, Brachyury, Goosecoid, Nestin, Pax6, Gata6 and Cytokeratin 8) confirms that cells in the spheres maintain their gene expression profile. The cells in the spheres also retain the ability to differentiate in vitro to form cells representative of the three germline layers after five passages.</str>

      <str>In certain urodeles, a lost appendage, including hand and foot, can be completely replaced through epimorphic regeneration. The regeneration process involves cellular activities similar to those described for embryogenesis. Working on the assumption that the morphological pattern specific for a forelimb or a hindlimb is controlled by different gene activities in the two limbs, we employed a mRNA differential display screen for the detection of candidate limb identity genes. Using this approach, we have isolated a newt gene which in regenerating and developing limbs reveals properties expected of a gene having a role in controlling limb morphology: (1) it is exclusively expressed in the forelimbs, but not hindlimbs, (2) during embryonic development its expression is co-incident with forelimb bud formation, (3) it has an elevated message level throughout the undifferentiated limb bud and the blastema, respectively, and (4) it is expressed only in mesenchymal, but not in epidermal tissues. This novel newt gene shares a conserved DNA-binding domain, the T-box, with putative transcription factors including the Brachyury (T) gene product. In a following PCR-based screen, we used the evolutionarily conserved T-box motif and amplified a family of related genes in the newt; their different expression patterns in normal and regenerating forelimbs, hindlimbs and tail suggest, in general, an important role of T-domain proteins in vertebrate pattern formation.</str>

      <str>We have developed an in vitro differentiation assay to characterize the ability of peptide growth factors to induce differentiation in mouse epiblast. We report that culturing explants of mouse anterior epiblast, a tissue normally fated to give rise to neuroectoderm and surface ectoderm, in a serum-free, chemically defined medium with 10-50 ng/ml of FGF-2 induced gross changes in cell morphology. Treated cells adopted an elongated, flattened morphology but did not migrate from the explant. Instead, FGF-2-treated cells condensed into multicellular mounds or ridges. Immunocytochemistry showed that cells in treated explants expressed vimentin and in situ hybridization demonstrated that FGF-2 induced the expression of brachyury, goosecoid, and myo-D in regions of treated explants displaying morphological differentiation. Control explants cultured with platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF AA), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), or in defined medium alone showed no morphological or biochemical differentiation. These results indicate that FGF-2 altered the fate of mouse anterior epiblast from ectoderm to mesoderm in vitro. Cell migration, which is characteristic of primitive streak mesoderm in vivo, was not induced by FGF-2 in these assays. However, the changes in morphology and the expression of mesodermal genes in vitro do support an early role for FGF signaling in the induction of mouse primitive streak mesoderm, as well as in later patterning events during embryogenesis.</str>

      <str>Patterning of the Xenopus gastrula marginal zone in the axis running equatorially from the Spemann organizer-the so--called "dorsal/ventral axis"--has been extensively studied. It is now evident that patterning in the animal/vegetal axis also needs to be taken into consideration. We have shown that an animal/vegetal pattern is apparent in the marginal zone by midgastrulation in the polarized expression domains of Xenopus brachyury (Xbra) and Xenopus nodal-related factor 2 (Xnr2). In this report, we have followed cells expressing Xbra in the presumptive trunk and tail at the gastrula stage, and find that they fate to presumptive somite, but not to ventrolateral mesoderm of the tailbud embryo. From this, we speculate that the boundary between the Xbra- and Xnr2-expressing cells at gastrula corresponds to a future tissue boundary. In further experiments, we show that the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is polarized along the animal/vegetal axis, with the Xnr2-expressing cells in the vegetal marginal zone having no detectable activated MAPK. We show that inhibition of MAPK activation in Xenopus animal caps results in the conversion of Xnr2 from a dorsal mesoderm inducer to a ventral mesoderm inducer, supporting a role for Xnr2 in induction of ventral mesoderm.</str>

      <str>Mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells undergo cardiogenesis in response to high density and DMSO. We have derived a clonal subline that undergoes cardiogenesis in response to high density, but without requiring exposure to DMSO. The new subline retains the capacity to differentiate into skeletal muscle and neuronal cells in response to DMSO and retinoic acid. However, upon aggregation, these Oct 4-positive cells, termed P19-SI because they "self-induce" cardiac muscle, exhibit increased mRNAs encoding the mesodermal factor Brachyury, cardiac transcription factors Nkx 2.5 and GATA 4, the transcriptional repressor Msx-1, and cytokines Wnt 3a, Noggin, and BMP 4. Exposure of aggregated P19-SI cells to BMP 4, a known inducer of cardiogenesis, accelerates cardiogenesis, as determined by rhythmic beating and myosin staining. However, cardiogenesis is severely inhibited when P19-SI cells are aggregated in the presence of BMP 4. These results demonstrate that cell-cell interaction is required before P19-SI cells can undergo a cardiogenic response to BMP 4. A concurrent increase in the expression of Msx-1 suggests one possible process underlying the inhibition of cardiogenesis. The phenotype of P19-SI cells offers an opportunity to explore new aspects of cardiac induction.</str>

      <str>Deuterostome animals exhibit widely divergent body plans. Echinoderms have either radial or bilateral symmetry, hemichordates include bilateral enteropneust worms and colonial pterobranchs, and chordates possess a defined dorsal-ventral axis imposed on their anterior-posterior axis. Tunicates are chordates only as larvae, following metamorphosis the adults acquire a body plan unique for the deuterostomes. This paper examines larval and adult body plans in the deuterostomes and discusses two distinct ways of evolving divergent body plans. First, echinoderms and hemichordates have similar feeding larvae, but build a new adult body within or around their larvae. In hemichordates and many direct-developing echinoderms, the adult is built onto the larva, with the larval axes becoming the adult axes and the larval mouth becoming the adult mouth. In contrast, indirect-developing echinoderms undergo radical metamorphosis where adult axes are not the same as larval axes. A second way of evolving a divergent body plan is to become colonial, as seen in hemichordates and tunicates. Early embryonic development and gastrulation are similar in all deuterostomes, but, in chordates, the anterior-posterior axis is established at right angles to the animal-vegetal axis, in contrast to hemichordates and indirect-developing echinoderms. Hox gene sequences and anterior-posterior expression patterns illuminate deuterostome phylogenetic relationships and the evolution of unique adult body plans within monophyletic groups. Many genes that are considered vertebrate 'mesodermal' genes, such as nodal and brachyury T, are likely to ancestrally have been involved in the formation of the mouth and anus, and later were evolutionarily co-opted into mesoderm during vertebrate development.</str>

      <str>The Drosophila gut is composed of three major parts, the foregut, midgut and hindgut, which arise from anterior and posterior invaginations of the early blastoderm. We review the process of the specification of the gut primordia, subsequent subdivision and region-specific cell differentiation in terms of developmental genetics. Graded activities of maternal signals at anterior and posterior terminal domains of the blastoderm, being mediated by activities of two zygotic gap genes, tailless and huckebein, lead to the activation of key genes that determine the gut primordia: serpent (GATA factor gene) for the endodermal midgut; brachyenteron (Brachyury homolog) for the ectodermal hindgut. fork head (HNF-3 homolog) and caudal (Cdx homolog) are also essential for the development of all gut primordia or hindgut primordium, respectively. Subdivision of the midgut epithelium is regulated by inductive signals emanating from the visceral mesoderm, which is under the control of HOM-C genes. In contrast, pattern formation of the ectodermal foregut and hindgut is regulated by secreted signaling molecules, such as Wingless (Wnt homolog), Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic (Bmp-4 homolog), as in the case of segmented structures and imaginal discs. Finally, the gut is subdivided into at least 36 compartments that are recognized asminimum tissue units of regional differentiation. A few genes that are responsible for determining and maintaining the state of overt-differentiation of the compartments have also been reported. A marked feature of the genetic mechanism of the gut development is the unexpectedly wide spectrum of the similarities of relevant genes and regulatory pathways of gene expression between Drosophila and vertebrates, which may imply a prototypic style of body plan common to protostomes and deuterostomes.</str>

Signalling molecules induced cell-autonomously by VegT include derrière, Xnr4 and activin B. Xnr1 and Xnr2 are also induced, but primarily in a non-autonomous manner. All of these signalling molecules are found in the blastula and gastrula vegetal pole and induce both endoderm and mesoderm in the animal cap assay, and hence are good candidates both for the endogenous zygotic mesoderm-inducing signal and for reinforcing the vegetal expression of endoderm markers.</str>

      <str>The lamin B receptor (LBR) is an integral membrane protein of the inner nuclear membrane that is interacting with B-type lamins, chromatin and DNA. The complete loss of the protein in mouse mutants causes a reduced viability of embryos, and viable animals develop abnormalities of the skeleton. Here, we present the molecular characterization of the zebrafish LBR (zLBR) gene and the functional analysis of LBR during zebrafish embryogenesis. We found that the coding region of the LBR mRNA of zebrafish as well as of mammals is contained in 13 exons. At the protein level, human and zebrafish LBR exhibit a high sequence identity (57% and higher) in 8 of the 13 exons. Knockdown of zLBR by microinjection of 0.5-1.0 mM morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) into 1- to 2-cell stage embryos reduced the amount of endogenous zLBR protein to approximately 10-20%. The viability of MO-injected embryos within 24 h was reduced to 70-77%. Surviving 1-day-old embryos exhibited morphological alterations including reduced growth of head structures, retardation of tail growth and a bent backbone and tail. Expression analysis of the transcription factors no tail (ntl) and goosecoid (gsc) by in situ hybridization suggests that these malformations are caused by altered cell migration during gastrulation.

Injection of dsRNA corresponding to the T-box gene tbx16/spadetail (spt) into early wild-type embryos caused a rapid and dramatic loss of tbx16/spt mRNA in the blastula. mRNAs from the papc, tbx6, and gata1 genes, which depend on tbx16/spt function for their expression, were reduced, apparently mimicking the spt mutant phenotype. However, mRNAs from a number of genes that are unaffected by the spt mutation, such as beta catenin, stat3, and no tail, were also lost, indicating that the "interference" effect of tbx16/spt dsRNA was not restricted to the endogenous tbx16/spt mRNA. We compared the effects of injecting dsRNA from the zebrafish tbx16/spadetail, nieuwkoid/bozozok, and Brachyury/no tail genes with dsRNA from the bacterial lacZ gene. In each case the embryos displayed a variable syndrome of abnormalities at 12 and 24 h postfertilization. In blind studies, we could not distinguish between the effects of the various dsRNAs. Consistent with a common effect of dsRNA, regardless of sequence, injection of dsRNA from the lacZ gene was likewise effective in strongly reducing tbx16/spt and beta catenin mRNA in the blastula. These findings indicate that, despite published reports, the current methodology of double-stranded RNA interference is not a practical technique for investigating zygotic gene function during early zebrafish development.</str>

      <str>Zebrafish eve1, a member of the even-skipped related gene family, is expressed initially in the animal pole of late blastula embryo and subsequently restricted to the ventral mesoderm of the gastrula embryo under the signaling control of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp). Overexpression of eve1 in embryos results in similar ventralized phenotypes to that seen in embryos overexpressing Bmp, suggesting that Eve1 acts downstream of the Bmp signaling pathway to regulate the fate of mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs). How eve1 functions in the normal development of MPCs is unknown. Using overexpression of a chimeric protein of Eve1 fused to the Gal4 activation domain and gene-knockdown approaches, we investigated the role of eve1 in MPC development of zebrafish embryos at early gastrulation. We find that Eve1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and is required for normal MPC development. The role of eve1 in MPCs requires the redundant and cooperative functions of Bmp-activated downstream homeobox genes, ved, vent and vox. Inhibition of eve1, ved, vent and vox in double and triple combinations results in dorsalized phenotypes. Furthermore, specific inhibition of eve1 and ved causes the expression of an ectopic patch of the brachyury ortholog no tail and leads to the formation of an ectopic tail. Our data show that Eve1 functions together with Ved, Vent and Vox in a transcriptional network to prevent the spread of anti-Bmp gene activity from the dorsal side, leading to the establishment of the Bmp gradient activity along the dorsoventral axis to induce distinct transcriptional outputs in MPCs to maintain the lateral and ventral MPC fates during gastrulation.</str>

Conventionally, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or other animal-based feeder layers are used to support embryonic stem cell (ESC) growth; the use of such feeder cells increases the risk of retroviral and other pathogenic infection in clinical trials. Implementation of a human-based feeder layer, such as hUSSCs that are isolated from human sources, lowers such risks. Isolated cord blood USSCs derived from various donors were used as a novel, supportive feeder layer for growth of C4mES cells (Royan C4 ESCs). Complete cellular characterization using immunocytochemical and flow cytometric methods were performed on murine ESCs (mESCs) and hUSSCs. mESCs cultured on hUSSCs showed similar cellular morphology and presented the same cell markers of undifferentiated mESC as would have been observed in mESCs grown on MEFs. Our data revealed these cells had negative expression of Stat3, Sox2, and Fgf4 genes while showing positive expression for Pou5f1, Nanog, Rex1, Brachyury, Lif, Lifr, Tert, B2m, and Bmp4 genes. Moreover, mESCs cultured on hUSSCs exhibited proven differentiation potential to germ cell layers showing normal karyotype. The major advantage of hUSSCs is their ability to be continuously cultured for at least 50 passages. We have also found that hUSSCs have the potential to provide ESC support from the early moments of isolation. Further study of hUSSC as a novel human feeder layer may lead to their incorporation into clinical methods, making them a vital part of the application of human ESCs in clinical cell therapy.</str>

Here, through a comprehensive analysis of miR-124 and its gene targets, we demonstrate that, in the chordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis, miR-124 plays an extensive role in promoting nervous system development. We discovered that feedback interaction between miR-124 and Notch signaling regulates the epidermal-peripheral nervous system (PNS) fate choice in tail midline cells. Notch signaling silences miR-124 in epidermal midline cells, whereas in PNS midline cells miR-124 silences Notch, Neuralized and all three Ciona Hairy/Enhancer-of-Split genes. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-124 is sufficient to convert epidermal midline cells into PNS neurons, consistent with a role in modulating Notch signaling. More broadly, genome-wide target extraction with validation using an in vivo tissue-specific sensor assay indicates that miR-124 shapes neuronal progenitor fields by downregulating non-neural genes, notably the muscle specifier Macho-1 and 50 Brachyury-regulated notochord genes, as well as several anti-neural factors including SCP1 and PTBP1. 3'UTR conservation analysis reveals that miR-124 targeting of SCP1 is likely to have arisen as a shared, derived trait in the vertebrate/tunicate ancestor and targeting of PTBP1 is conserved among bilaterians except for ecdysozoans, while extensive Notch pathway targeting appears to be Ciona specific. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive insight into the specific mechanisms by which miR-124 promotes neuronal development.</str>

      <str>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinase found in almost all eukaryotes. It is structurally highly conserved and has been identified as a multifaceted enzyme affecting a wide range of biological functions, including gene expression and cellular processes. There are two closely related isoforms of GSK-3; GSK-3α and GSK-3β. The latter appears to play crucial roles in regulating the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, including neurodegenerative disease. The present review focuses on the involvement of this protein in Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradually progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, and by intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs) expressed in surviving neurons of the substantia nigra (SN). GSK-3β is involved in multiple signaling pathways and has several phosphorylation targets. Numerous apoptotic conditions can be facilitated by the GSK-3β signaling pathways. Studies have shown that GSK-3β inhibition protects the dopaminergic neurons from various stress-induced injuries, indicating the involvement of GSK-3β in PD pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of GSK-3β inhibition on dopaminergic neurons in PD is not completely understood. Multiple pathological events have been recognized to be responsible for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, protein aggregation and neuroinflammation. The present review stresses the regulatory roles of GSK-3β in these events and in dopaminergic neuron degeneration, in an attempt to gain an improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms and to provide a potential effective therapeutic target for PD.</str>

      <str>T-box genes play roles in vertebrate gastrulation and in later organogenesis. Their existence in all metazoans examined so far indicates that this is an evolutionarily ancient gene family. Drosophila melanogaster has eight T-box genes, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans has 22. Mammals appear to have at least 18 T-box genes, comprising five subfamilies.</str>
      <str>A full range of cytological, developmental, molecular and genetic methodologies have recently been applied to the study of T-box genes.</str>
      <str>Over the last 5 years, mutations in TBX1 and TBX5 have been implicated in two human disorders with haplo-insufficient cardiovascular phenotypes, DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome and Holt-Oram ("heart-hand") syndrome. Interestingly, the number of T-box gene family members discovered to have cardiac or pharyngeal arch expression domains during vertebrate embryonic development has steadily grown. In addition, various Tbx5 loss-of-function models in organisms as distant as the mouse and zebrafish do indeed phenocopy Holt-Oram syndrome. Finally, the intriguing discovery earlier this year that a T-box gene is expressed in a subset of cardioblasts in D. melanogaster suggests that members of this gene family may have fundamental, conserved roles in cardiovascular pattern formation.</str>

      <str>Small membrane-permeable molecules are now widely used during maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells of different species. In particular the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is an interesting target, since its chemical inhibition activates the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. In the present comparative study four GSK3 inhibitors were characterized.</str>
      <str>Cytotoxicity and potential to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were tested using the commonly used GSK3 inhibitors BIO, SB-216763, CHIR-99021, and CHIR-98014.

      <str>Many lineage-specific developmental regulator genes are transcriptionally primed in embryonic stem (ES) cells; RNA Pol(II) is bound at their promoters but is prevented from productive elongation by the activity of polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) 1 and 2. This epigenetically poised state is thought to enable ES cells to rapidly execute multiple differentiation programs and is recognized by a simultaneous enrichment for trimethylation of lysine 4 and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (bivalent chromatin) across promoter regions. Here we show that the chromatin profile of this important cohort of genes is progressively modified as ES cells differentiate toward blood-forming precursors. Surprisingly however, neural specifying genes, such as Nkx2-2, Nkx2-9, and Sox1, remain bivalent and primed even in committed hemangioblasts, as conditional deletion of PRC1 results in overt and inappropriate expression of neural genes in hemangioblasts. These data reinforce the importance of PRC1 for normal hematopoietic differentiation and reveal an unexpected epigenetic plasticity of mesoderm-committed hemangioblasts.</str>

      <str>Strategies to promote intervertebral disc (IVD) regeneration have been hindered by the lack of knowledge of IVD fundamental cellular/molecular components. One of the key points to be addressed is the characterization of nucleus pulposus (NP) cell population(s). This study establishes an improved method for bovine NP (bNP) cell isolation, whose procedure is still not consensual among the literature, allowing a thorough characterization of cell (sub)populations that exist in the young NP.</str>
      <str>bNP was digested with distinct enzymes (collagenase-type-I, collagenase-type-II, and collagenase-type-XI) at different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL), for 4 and 19 h. Cell yield, viability/apoptosis, and morphology were analyzed by flow cytometry and imaging flow cytometry. Identification of cell subpopulations within NP and its phenotype was investigated by assessing expression of CD29, CD44, CD45, CD34, CD146, and Brachyury.</str>
      <str>It was found that bNP cells present a similar morphology independently of the digestive enzyme used. However, cell yield was greatly improved by Coll-XI (2 mg/mL) treatment for a short digestion period. Interestingly, three subpopulations, with different sizes and auto-fluorescence, were consistently identified by flow cytometry. And crucially, differential expression of cell markers was found among these subpopulations.</str>
      <str>This study demonstrated that collagenase-type-XI is an efficient enzyme that is used for digesting bNP. And most importantly, three phenotypically distinct subpopulations of cells where identified within the bNP. Such knowledge is key for a better understanding of NP cell biology and its potential endogenous regenerative capacity.</str>

      <str>In the sea urchin embryo, the oral-aboral axis is specified after fertilization by mechanisms that are largely unknown. We report that early sea urchin embryos express Nodal and Antivin in the presumptive oral ectoderm and demonstrate that these genes control formation of the oral-aboral axis. Overexpression of nodal converted the whole ectoderm into oral ectoderm and induced ectopic expression of the orally expressed genes goosecoid, brachyury, BMP2/4, and antivin. Conversely, when the function of Nodal was blocked, by injection of an antisense Morpholino oligonucleotide or by injection of antivin mRNA, neither the oral nor the aboral ectoderm were specified. Injection of nodal mRNA into Nodal-deficient embryos induced an oral-aboral axis in a largely non-cell-autonomous manner. These observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for patterning the oral-aboral axis of the sea urchin embryo may share similarities with mechanisms that pattern the dorsoventral axis of other deuterostomes.</str>

      <str>Genomic imprinting in mammals causes certain genes to be expressed according to their parental origin and thereby prevents parthenogenesis. However, the evolutionary origin and significance of genomic imprinting remains unclear. Here, we study the methylation status of ntl, a developmentally decisive gene, in egg, sperm and early embryos at various developmental stages in bisexual diploid fish and unisexual polyploid fish. Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that maternal-specific methylation occurs at ntl promoter during gametogenesis in bisexual diploid fish, where the epigenetic asymmetry of the parental alleles is maintained during cleavage, but methylation does not occur at ntl promoter in unisexual polyploid fish. Knocking down Kaiso, a methyl-CpG dependent transcription repressor, greatly increased the expression level of the methylated maternal allele during early embryogenesis and rescued the failure of anterior notochord formation in the gynogenetic haploid of bisexual fish. This indicated that the methylated maternal ntl allele is silent during early embryogenesis and this early silencing is dependent on the methylated-CpG binding protein Kaiso. Using single sequence polymorphisms in distinguishing paternally and maternally derived transcripts in the diploid fish, we demonstrated that the unmethylated paternal allele begins transcription at the 2-cell stage and maintains transcriptional activity during cleavage. These results suggest that genomic imprinting originates from primitive vertebrates in association with genome diploidization and bisexual reproduction during vertebrate genome evolution and has a clear effect in preventing parthenogenesis.</str>

      <str>MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate protein expression by binding 3'UTRs of target mRNAs, thereby inhibiting translation. Similar to siRNAs, miRNAs are cleaved by Dicer. Mouse and ES cell Dicer mutants demonstrate that microRNAs are necessary for embryonic development and cellular differentiation. However, technical obstacles and the relative infancy of this field have resulted in few data on the functional significance of individual microRNAs. We present evidence that miR-17 family members, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-93, and miR-106a, are differentially expressed in developing mouse embryos and function to control differentiation of stem cells. Specifically, miR-93 localizes to differentiating primitive endoderm and trophectoderm of the blastocyst. We also observe high miR-93 and miR-17-5p expression within the mesoderm of gastrulating embryos. Using an ES cell model system, we demonstrate that modulation of these miRNAs delays or enhances differentiation into the germ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that these miRNAs regulate STAT3 mRNA in vitro. We suggest that STAT3, a known ES cell regulator, is one target mRNA responsible for the effects of these miRNAs on cellular differentiation.</str>

      <str>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into all somatic cell types, including cardiomyocytes, which may be used for regenerative cardiac cell therapies. ESCs are commonly differentiated via cell aggregates known as embryoid bodies (EBs), but current cardiomyogenic differentiation methods, such as formation via hanging drops, yield relatively small numbers of EBs and differentiated cells. On the other hand, batch culture methods, like static suspension, yield increased numbers of EBs and cells, but typically exhibit less overall cardiomyogenic differentiation. The objective of this study was to determine if rotary orbital suspension culture, which produces EBs resembling hanging drops, was capable of enhancing cardiomyogenic differentiation compared to static suspension culture. Similar to hanging drops, rotary suspension culture significantly increased the proportion of spontaneously contracting EBs compared to static suspension culture. The gene expression of mesoderm (Brachyury-T) and cardiac transcription factors (Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Mef2c), as well as sarcomeric muscle proteins (alpha-MHC and MLC-2v) was increased within EBs cultured in rotary suspension conditions. Rotary orbital culture also yielded a greater percentage of EBs that were immunoreactive for alpha-sarcomeric actin protein compared to static suspension, and augmented the average percentage of alpha-sarcomeric actin-positive cells detected via flow cytometry. These results demonstrate that rotary orbital suspension culture enhances endogenous cardiomyogenesis of EBs and therefore could benefit the development of regenerative cardiac therapies.</str>

      <str>The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins plays an integral role in embryonic development and differentiation. To explore the role of Wnt's in one aspect of differentiation, namely osteogenesis, we employed a retroviral gene transfer approach to express Wnt-3a in the multipotent murine embryonic mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2. We found that expression of Wnt-3a in these cells had a significant, positive effect on cell growth in serum-containing medium, in that the cells grew to very high densities compared to the control cells. Additionally, apoptosis was markedly inhibited by Wnt-3a. However, when the cells were grown in serum-deficient medium, the Wnt-3a-expressing cells arrested efficiently in G1 phase, indicating that serum growth factors were needed in addition to Wnt-3a for enhanced proliferation. Wnt-3a-expressing cells exhibited high levels of alkaline phosphatase gene expression and enzymatic activity, but did not show any matrix mineralization. Unexpectedly, basal expression of bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and osteopontin were markedly inhibited by Wnt-3a, as were other known target genes of Wnt-3a, such as Brachyury, FGF-10, and Cdx1. When Wnt-3a-expressing cells were treated with osteogenic supplements in the presence of BMP-2, alkaline phosphatase gene expression and activity were further elevated. Additionally, BMP-2 was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of Wnt-3a on osteocalcin and osteopontin gene expression. These results indicate that while Wnt-3a represses basal expression of some osteogenic genes, this repression can be partially reversed by BMP-2. Finally, the enhanced gene expression of alkaline phosphatase induced by Wnt-3a could be effectively suppressed by the combined action of dexamethasone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). These data show for the first time that Wnt-3a has an unusual effect on multipotential embryonic cells, in that it enhances cellular proliferation and expression of alkaline phosphatase, while it represses most other marker genes of osteogenic differentiation.</str>

      <str>The pitx2 gene is a member of the bicoid-homeodomain class of transcription factors that has been implicated in the control of left-right asymmetry during organogenesis. Here we demonstrate that in zebrafish there are two pitx2 isoforms, pitx2a and pitx2c, which show distinct expression patterns and have non-overlapping functions during mesendoderm and asymmetric organ development. pitx2c is expressed symmetrically in presumptive mesendoderm during late blastula stages and in the prechordal plate during late gastrulation. pitx2a expression is first detected at bud stage in the anterior prechordal plate. The regulation of early mesendoderm pitx2c expression is dependent on one-eyed pinhead (EGF-CFC-related gene) and spadetail (tbx-transcription factor) and can be induced by ectopic goosecoid expression. Maintenance of pitx2c midline expression is dependent on cyclops (nodal) and schmalspur, but not no tail (brachyury). Ectopic expression of pitx2 isoforms results in distinct morphological and molecular phenotypes, indicating that pitx2a and pitx2c have divergent regulatory functions. Both isoforms downregulate goosecoid on the dorsal side, but in contrast to earlier reports that nodal and lefty are upstream of pitx2, ectopic pitx2c in other regions induces cyclops, lefty2 and goosecoid expression. Asymmetric isoform expression occurs in non-overlapping domains, with pitx2c in left dorsal diencephalon and developing gut and pitx2a in left heart primordium. Targeted asymmetric expression in Xenopus shows that both isoforms can alter left-right development, but pitx2a has a slightly stronger effect on heart laterality. Our results indicate that distinct genetic pathways regulate pitx2a and pitx2c isoform expression, and each isoform regulates different downstream pathways during mesendoderm and asymmetric organ development.</str>

      <str>Seven patients with chordoma who were treated in the Universitätsklinik für Nuklearmedizin und Radiotherapie, Zürich, since 1950 are presented. In all the cases, high-dose irradiation resulted in symptom-free survival of many years duration. Five years after the first treatment, all the patients are alive, after ten years about 50% of the patients are alive. Our own experiences as well as the already published cases show that radiotherapy has an important role in the management of chordoma.</str>

      <str>Many excellent reports have dealt with the various aspects of cranial chordoma. It remains a relatively rare neoplasm, particularly in younger children. The authors have had the opportunity to treat a 5-year-old child harboring a basiocciput chordoma. It extended from the mid-clivus to C3. A transoral labiomandibular approach was used, allowing its resection. No evidence of recurrence was noted 3 years later. A literature search confirmed the rarity of basiocciput chordoma in young children. The perioperative difficulties encountered prompted this report.</str>
