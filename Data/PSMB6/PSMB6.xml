      <str>PSMB6 subunit belongs to the 20S proteasomal subunit family, which plays an importance role in the antigen presentation by MHC class I molecular. The full-length genomic DNA sequence was obtained by PCR and the full-length CDS of porcine PSMB6 was isolated by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The deduced protein of 239 amino acids showed 86% identity to the corresponding human sequence. RT-PCR revealed that porcine PSMB6 gene was expressed in seven tissues studied (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and fat) and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR analysis showed PSMB6 gene was expressed highest in spleen. A single nucleotide substitution resulting in the amino acid change (19Pro-19His) was detected within exon 1 and other two single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in intron 1. The Genetic variations were identified in eight pig breeds showed diverse results. Furthermore, we found that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP, G/T300) was significantly associated with delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH, P &lt; 0.05), immunoglobin G (IgG1, P &lt; 0.05), white blood cell count (WBC, P &lt; 0.05). Using the pig/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel (SCHP), we mapped the porcine PSMB6 gene to SSC12, in agreement with comparative mapping data.</str>

      <str>Chronic hypoxia (CH) is known to be one of the major causes of pulmonary hypertension (PH), which is characterized by sustained elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance resulting from vascular remodeling. In this study, we investigated whether the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) was involved in the mechanism of hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. We isolated the distal pulmonary artery (PA) from a previously defined chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (CHPH) rat model, performed proteomic analyses in search of differentially expressed proteins belonging to the UPS, and subsequently identified their roles in arterial remodeling.</str>
      <str>Twenty-two proteins were differently expressed between the CH and normoxic group. Among them, the expression of proteasome subunit beta (PSMB) 1 and PSMB6 increased after CH exposure. Given that PSMB1 is a well-known structural subunit and PSMB6 is a functional subunit, we sought to assess whether PSMB6 could be related to the multiple functional changes during the CHPH process. We confirmed the proteomic results by real-time PCR and Western blot. With the increase in quantity of the active subunit, proteasome activity in both cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and isolated PA from the hypoxic group increased. An MTT assay revealed that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was able to attenuate the hypoxia-induced proliferation of PASMC in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of PSMB6 using siRNA also prevented hypoxia-induced proliferation.</str>
      <str>The present study revealed the association between increased PSMB6 and CHPH. CH up-regulated proteasome activity and the proliferation of PASMCs, which may have been related to increased PSMB6 expression and the subsequently enhanced functional catalytic sites of the proteasome. These results suggested an essential role of the proteasome during CHPH development, a novel finding requiring further study.</str>

      <str>Deltamethrin (DM) insecticides are currently being promoted worldwide for mosquito control, because of the high efficacy, low mammalian toxicity and less environmental impact. Widespread and improper use of insecticides induced resistance, which has become a major obstacle for the insect-borne disease management. Resistance development is a complex and dynamic process involving many genes. To better understand the possible molecular mechanisms involved in DM resistance, a proteomic approach was employed for screening of differentially expressed proteins in DM-susceptible and -resistant mosquito cells. Twenty-seven differentially expressed proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Four members of the ubiquitin-proteasome system were significantly elevated in DM-resistant cells, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may play an important role in DM resistance. Proteasome subunit beta type 6 (PSMB6) is a member of 20S proteasomal subunit family, which forms the proteolytic core of 26S proteasome. We used pharmaceutical inhibitor and molecular approaches to study the contributions of PSMB6 in DM resistance: the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and bortezomib were used to suppress the proteasomal activity and siRNA was designed to block the function of PSMB6. The results revealed that both MG-132 and bortezomib increased the susceptibility in DM-resistant cells and resistance larvae. Moreover, PSMB6 knockdown decreased cellular viability under DM treatment. Taken together, our study indicated that PSMB6 is associated with DM resistance in mosquitoes and that proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132 or bortezomib are suitable for use as a DM synergist for vector control.</str>

      <str>The key to a more effective diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management of prostate cancer (PCa) could lie in the direct analysis of cancer tissue. In this study, by comparative proteomics analysis of PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues we attempted to elucidate the proteins and regulatory pathways involved in this disease.</str>
      <str>The samples used in this study were fresh surgical tissues with clinically and histologically confirmed PCa (n = 19) and BPH (n = 33). We used two dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics analysis.</str>
      <str>Thirty-nine spots with statistically significant 1.8-fold variation or more in abundance, corresponding to 28 proteins were identified. The IPA analysis pointed out to 3 possible networks regulated within MAPK, ERK, TGFB1, and ubiquitin pathways. Thirteen of the identified proteins, namely, constituents of the intermediate filaments (KRT8, KRT18, DES), potential tumor suppressors (ARHGAP1, AZGP1, GSTM2, and MFAP4), transport and membrane organization proteins (FABP5, GC, and EHD2), chaperons (FKBP4 and HSPD1) and known cancer marker (NME1) have been associated with prostate and other cancers by numerous proteomics, genomics or functional studies. We evidenced for the first time the dysregulation of 9 proteins (CSNK1A1, ARID5B, LYPLA1, PSMB6, RABEP1, TALDO1, UBE2N, PPP1CB, and SERPINB1) that may have role in PCa. The UBE2N, PSMB6, and PPP1CB, involved in cell cycle regulation and progression were evaluated by Western blot analysis which confirmed significantly higher abundances of UBE2N and PSMB6 and significantly lower abundance of PPP1CB in PCa.</str>
      <str>In addition to the identification of substantial number of proteins with known association with PCa, the proteomic approach in this study revealed proteins not previously clearly related to PCa, providing a starting point for further elucidation of their function in disease initiation and progression.

      <str>The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, but mechanisms controlling expression of components in this pathway remain poorly understood. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) transcription factor has been shown to regulate expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. To determine the function of Nrf1 in the brain, mice with a late-stage deletion of Nrf1 in neuronal cells were generated. Loss of Nrf1 leads to impaired proteasome function and neurodegeneration. Gene expression profiling and RT-PCR analysis revealed a coordinate down-regulation of various proteasomal genes including PsmB6, which encodes a catalytic subunit of the proteasome. Transcriptional analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PsmB6 is an Nrf1 target gene. These findings reveal Nrf1 as a key transcriptional regulator required for the expression of proteasomal genes in neurons and suggest that perturbations of Nrf1 function may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</str>

      <str>Periplocin is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, reinforcement of bones and tendons, palpitations or shortness of breath and lower extremity edema in traditional medicine. Our previous findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo. But the biological processes and molecular pathways by which periplocin induces these beneficial effects remain largely undefined.</str>
      <str>To explore the molecular mechanisms of periplocin involved in anti-cancer activity, in the present study the protein profile changes of human lung cancer cell lines A549 in response to periplocin treatment were investigated using the proteomics approaches (2-DE combined with MS/MS). Western blot was employed to verify the changed proteins. Interactions between changed proteins were analyzed by STRING.</str>
      <str>29 down-regulated protein species named GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN), Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 (ARHGDIA), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (EIF5A) and Profilin-1(PFN1), and 10 up-regulated protein species named Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSPA8),10 kDa heat shock protein (HSPE1), and Cofilin-1(CFL-1) were identified. Among them, GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN) and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 (ARHGDIA) were the most significantly changed (over tenfold). The proteasome subunit beta type-6 (PSMB6), ATP synthase ecto-α-subunit (ATP5A1), Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and EIF5A were verified by immunoblot assays to be dramatically down-regulated. By STRING bioinformatics analysis revealing interactions and signaling networks it became apparent that the proteins changed they are primarily involved in transcription and proteolysis.</str>

      <str>The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a central role in protein quality control through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of unfolded and misfolded proteins. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of an array of phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes. Nrf2 signaling has additionally been shown to upregulate the expression of the proteasome catalytic subunits in several cell types. Here, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in tunicamycin-induced ER stress using a murine insulinoma β-cell line, βTC-6. shRNA-mediated silencing of Nrf2 expression in βTC-6 cells significantly increased tunicamycin-induced cytotoxicity, elevated the expression of the pro-apoptotic ER stress marker Chop10, and inhibited tunicamycin-inducible expression of the proteasomal catalytic subunits Psmb5 and Psmb6. The effects of 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), a small molecule Nrf2 activator, on ER stress were also examined in βTC-6 cells. D3T pretreatment reduced tunicamycin cytotoxicity and attenuated the tunicamycin-inducible Chop10 and protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase (Perk). The protective effect of D3T was shown to be associated with increased ERAD. D3T increased the expression of Psmb5 and Psmb6 and elevated chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity; proteasome inhibitor treatment blocked D3T effects on tunicamycin cytotoxicity and ER stress marker changes. Similarly, silencing of Nrf2 abolished the protective effect of D3T against ER stress. These results indicate that the Nrf2 pathway contributes to the ER stress response in pancreatic β-cells by enhancing proteasome-mediated ERAD.</str>

      <str>The proteasome is a multi-subunit protease responsible for the production of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Accumulated evidence indicates that, upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), three beta-type subunits, designated LMP2, LMP7, and PSMB10, are incorporated into the 20S proteasome by displacing the housekeeping beta-type subunits designated PSMB6, PSMB5, and PSMB7, respectively. These changes in the subunit composition appear to facilitate class I-mediated antigen presentation, presumably by altering the cleavage specificities of the proteasome. In the present study, we determined the organization of the mouse gene Psmb5, coding for the PSMB5 subunit. Psmb5 is made up of three exons, spanning approximately 5 kilobases. Its exon-intron organization differs radically from those of the other IFN-gamma-regulated, beta-type subunit genes including Lmp7 with which Psmb5 is believed to share an immediate common ancestor. The structure of the mouse Psmb5 gene is identical to that of its recently characterized human counterpart. Thus, the unique organization of the gene coding for the PSMB5 subunit appears to have been established before mammalian radiation. As well as the Psmb5 gene, the mouse genome contains a processed pseudogene designated Psmb5-ps. Interspecific backcross mapping showed that Psmb5 maps close to the Gtrgal2 locus on chromosome 14 and that Psmb5-ps is located in the vicinity of the Psme3 locus on chromosome 11. These results were confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis that localized Psmb5 to band C2 to proximal D1 of chromosome 14 and Psmb5-ps to band D of chromosome 11.</str>

      <str>The matrix protein (M) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is involved in virus assembly, budding, gene regulation, and cellular pathogenesis. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the M globular domain was shown to interact with LMP2, a catalytic subunit of the immunoproteasome (which replaces the standard proteasome catalytic subunit PSMB6). The interaction was validated by coimmunoprecipitation of M and LMP2 in VSV-infected cells. The sites of interaction were characterized. A single mutation of M (I96A) which significantly impairs the interaction between M and LMP2 was identified. We also show that M preferentially binds to the inactive precursor of LMP2 (bearing an N-terminal propeptide which is cleaved upon LMP2 maturation). Furthermore, taking advantage of a sequence alignment between LMP2 and its proteasome homolog, PSMB6 (which does not bind to M), we identified a mutation (L45R) in the S1 pocket where the protein substrate binds prior to cleavage and a second one (D17A) of a conserved residue essential for the catalytic activity, resulting in a reduction of the level of binding to M. The combination of both mutations abolishes the interaction. Taken together, our data indicate that M binds to LMP2 before its incorporation into the immunoproteasome. As the immunoproteasome promotes the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-compatible peptides, a feature which favors the recognition and the elimination of infected cells by CD8 T cells, we suggest that M, by interfering with the immunoproteasome assembly, has evolved a mechanism that allows infected cells to escape detection and elimination by the immune system.</str>
      <str>The immunoproteasome promotes the generation of MHC class I-compatible peptides, a feature which favors the recognition and the elimination of infected cells by CD8 T cells. Here, we report on the association of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) matrix protein (M) with LMP2, one of the immunoproteasome-specific catalytic subunits. M preferentially binds to the LMP2 inactive precursor. The M-binding site on LMP2 is facing inwards in the immunoproteasome and is therefore not accessible to M after its assembly. Hence, M binds to LMP2 before its incorporation into the immunoproteasome. We suggest that VSV M, by interfering with the immunoproteasome assembly, has evolved a mechanism that allows infected cells to escape detection and elimination by the immune system. Modulating this M-induced immunoproteasome impairment might be relevant in order to optimize VSV for oncolytic virotherapy.</str>

      <str>Little is known about the genetic mechanisms of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). This is the most virulent of all human malignancies, and it is believed to result from transformation of differentiated thyroid cancers. To identify a set of genes involved in the development of ATC, we investigated expression profiles of 11 cell lines derived from ATC using a cDNA microarray representing 25 344 genes. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments carried out for some genes that had shown altered expression on the microarray verified frequent over-expression of destrin, HSPA8, stathmin, LDH-A, ATP5A1, PSMB6, B23, HDP-1 and LDH-B, and frequent under-expression of thyroglobulin, PBP and c-FES/FPS genes among the cell lines and also among ten primary ATCs. In addition to mRNA expression studies, up-regulation of GDI2, destrin and stathmin were confirmed with immunohistochemical analysis. The extensive list of genes identified provides valuable information towards understanding the development of ATC, and provides a source of possible biomarkers for diagnosis and/or molecular targets for the development of novel drugs to treat ATC.</str>

      <str>The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a novel anticancer drug that has shown promise in the treatment of refractory multiple myeloma. However, its clinical efficacy has been hampered by the emergence of drug-resistance phenomena, the molecular basis of which remains elusive. Toward this end, we here developed high levels (45- to 129-fold) of acquired resistance to bortezomib in human myelomonocytic THP1 cells by exposure to stepwise increasing (2.5-200 nM) concentrations of bortezomib. Study of the molecular mechanism of bortezomib resistance in these cells revealed (1) an Ala49Thr mutation residing in a highly conserved bortezomib-binding pocket in the proteasome beta5-subunit (PSMB5) protein, (2) a dramatic overexpression (up to 60-fold) of PSMB5 protein but not of other proteasome subunits including PSMB6, PSMB7, and PSMA7, (3) high levels of cross-resistance to beta5 subunit-targeted cytotoxic peptides 4A6, MG132, MG262, and ALLN, but not to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs, (4) no marked changes in chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, and (5) restoration of bortezomib sensitivity in bortezomib-resistant cells by siRNA-mediated silencing of PSMB5 gene expression. Collectively, these findings establish a novel mechanism of bortezomib resistance associated with the selective overexpression of a mutant PSMB5 protein.</str>

Recently, we reported that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induced not only marked synthesis of the MHC-encoded proteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7, but also almost complete loss of two unidentified proteasome subunits tentatively designated as X and Y in various human cells. Here, we show that subunit X is a new proteasomal subunit highly homologous to LMP7, and that subunit Y is identical to the LMP2-related proteasomal subunit delta. Thus, IFN-gamma appears to induce subunit replacements of X and Y by LMP7 and LMP2, respectively, producing 'immuno-proteasomes' with the functional diversity responsible for processing of endogenous antigens.</str>

      <str>Reference genes (RG) as sample internal controls for gene transcript level analyses by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) must be stably expressed within the experimental range. A variety of in vitro cell culture settings with primary human hepatocytes, and Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines, were used to determine candidate RG expression stability in RT-qPCR analyses. Employing GeNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms, this study identifies PSMB6, MDH1 and some more RG as sufficiently unregulated, thus expressed at stable levels, in hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. Inclusion of multiple RG, quenching occasional regulations of single RG, greatly stabilises gene expression level calculations from RT-qPCR data. To further enhance validity and reproducibility of relative RT-qPCR quantifications, the ΔCT calculation can be extended (e-ΔCT) by replacing the CT of a single RG in ΔCT with an averaged CT-value from multiple RG. The use of two or three RG--here identified suited for human hepatocyte-like cells--for normalisation with the straightforward e-ΔCT calculation, should improve reproducibility and robustness of comparative RT-qPCR-based gene expression analyses.</str>

Primer pairs for 17 potential reference genes were designed and tested in archival tumour biopsies from six dogs. The geNorm algorithm was used to analyse the most suitable reference genes. Eight potential reference genes were excluded from this final analysis because of their dissociation curves. β-Glucuronidase (GUSB) and proteasome subunit, beta type, 6 (PSMB6) were most stably expressed with an M value of 0.154 and a CV of 0.053 describing their average stability.

      <str>Variations within proteasome β (PSMB) genes, which encode the β subunits of the 20S proteasome, may affect proteasome function, assembly, and/or binding of proteasome inhibitors. To investigate the potential association between PSMB gene variants and treatment-emergent resistance to bortezomib and/or long-term outcomes, in the present study, PSMB gene sequence variation was characterized in tumor DNA samples from patients who participated in the phase 3 Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions (APEX) study of bortezomib versus high-dose dexamethasone for treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma. Twelve new PSMB variants were identified. No associations were found between PSMB single nucleotide polymorphism genotype frequency and clinical response to bortezomib or dexamethasone treatment or between PSMB single nucleotide polymorphism allelic frequency and pooled overall survival or time to progression. Although specific PSMB5 variants have been identified previously in preclinical models of bortezomib resistance, these variants were not detected in patient tumor samples collected after clinical relapse from bortezomib, which suggests that alternative mechanisms underlie bortezomib insensitivity.</str>

Two proteasomal polymorphic genes, LMP2 and LMP7, are localized within the MHC class II region, closely linked to the TAP1 and TAP2 genes that are responsible for the ATP-dependent, size- and sequence-selective transport of antigenic peptides generated in the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) alters the peptide-degrading specificity of proteasomes and appears to produce an immunoproteasome responsible for accelerated processing of nonself endogenous antigens by inducing the replacement of subunits X and Y by LMP7 and LMP2, respectively. This IFN-gamma-induced change in the subunits of proteasomes by IFN-gamma is a new mechanism for an immunomodulatory action, differing from that for marked increases of TAP transporter and MHC molecules, which are possibly due to changes in transcriptional levels in cells. Based on these findings, I propose alteration of the subunit assembly of proteasomes in response to extracellular stimuli as a novel mechanism for the acquisition of their functional diversity that plays a central role in the immune response.</str>

      <str>There is a need to develop methods of early diagnosis for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic juice is easily collected by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and may facilitate diagnosis using molecular markers. The aim of this work was to explore the feasibility of measurement of gene expression in RNA isolated from ductal juice.</str>
      <str>Intraoperative sampling of pancreatic juice was undertaken in 27 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for suspected tumor. Total RNA was extracted and used as template for poly(adenylic acid) (poly[A]) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate a globally amplified complementary DNA pool representative of all expressed messenger RNAs. Real-time PCR was performed for trefoil factor 2 (TFF2), carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1), and kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) in a subset of samples; all samples were normalized for 3 reference genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], PSMB6, and beta-2-microglobulin [B2M]).</str>
      <str>The median volume of the pancreatic juice obtained was 1245 microL (range, 50-5000 microL). The RNA integrity number ranged from 1.9 to 10. Reverse transcriptase PCR was positive for pancreas-specific genes (TFF2 and CPB1) and negative for prostatic-specific antigen in all samples.</str>
      <str>These results demonstrate that RNA analysis of pancreatic juice is feasible using a combination of poly(A) PCR and real-time PCR. In addition, the poly(A) complementary DNA generated can be probed for multiple genes and is indefinitely renewable, thereby representing a molecular block of importance for future research.</str>

      <str>Coordinated regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is crucial for the cell to adjust its protein degradation capacity to changing proteolytic requirements. We have shown previously that mammalian cells upregulate proteasome gene expression in response to proteasome inhibition. Here, we report the identification of the transcription factor TCF11 (long isoform of Nrf1) as a key regulator for 26S proteasome formation in human cells to compensate for reduced proteolytic activity. Under noninducing conditions, TCF11 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. There, TCF11 is targeted to ER-associated protein degradation requiring the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and the AAA ATPase p97. Proteasome inhibitors trigger the accumulation of oxidant-damaged proteins and promote the nuclear translocation of TCF11 from the ER, permitting activation of proteasome gene expression by binding to antioxidant response elements in their promoter regions. Thus, we uncovered the transcriptional control loop regulating human proteasome-dependent protein degradation to counteract proteotoxic stress caused by proteasome inhibition.</str>

      <str>Recovery after stroke and other types of brain injury is restricted in part by the limited ability of undamaged neurons to form compensatory connections. Inosine, a naturally occurring purine nucleoside, stimulates neurons to extend axons in culture and, in vivo, enhances the ability of undamaged neurons to form axon collaterals after brain damage. The molecular changes induced by inosine are unknown, as is the ability of inosine to restore complex functions associated with a specific cortical area. Using a unilateral injury model limited to the sensorimotor cortex, we show that inosine triples the number of corticospinal tract axons that project from the unaffected hemisphere and form synaptic bouton-like structures in the denervated half of the spinal cord. These changes correlate with improved recovery in animals' ability to grasp and consume food pellets with the affected forepaw. Studies using laser-capture microdissection and microarray analysis show that inosine profoundly affects gene expression in corticospinal neurons contralateral to the injury. Inosine attenuates transcriptional changes caused by the stroke, while upregulating the expression of genes associated with axon growth and the complement cascade. Thus, inosine alters gene expression in neurons contralateral to a stroke, enhances the ability of these neurons to form connections on the denervated side of the spinal cord, and improves performance with the impaired limb.</str>

      <str>High-resolution mapping and identification of the genes responsible for type 1 diabetes (T1D) has proved difficult because of the multigenic etiology and low penetrance of the disease phenotype in linkage studies. Mouse congenic strains have been useful in refining Idd susceptibility loci in the NOD mouse model and providing a framework for identification of genes underlying complex autoimmune syndromes. Previously, we used NOD and a nonobese diabetes-resistant strain to map the susceptibility to T1D to the Idd4 locus on chromosome 11. Here, we report high-resolution mapping of this locus to 1.4 megabases. The NOD Idd4 locus was fully sequenced, permitting a detailed comparison with C57BL/6 and DBA/2J strains, the progenitors of T1D resistance alleles found in the nonobese diabetes-resistant strain. Gene expression arrays and quantitative real-time PCR were used to prioritize Idd4 candidate genes by comparing macrophages/dendritic cells from congenic strains where allelic variation was confined to the Idd4 interval. The differentially expressed genes either were mapped to Idd4 or were components of the IFN response pathway regulated in trans by Idd4. Reflecting central roles of Idd4 genes in Ag presentation, arachidonic acid metabolism and inflammation, phagocytosis, and lymphocyte trafficking, our combined analyses identified Alox15, Alox12e, Psmb6, Pld2, and Cxcl16 as excellent candidate genes for the effects of the Idd4 locus.</str>

      <str>Decreases in the 26S proteasome are related to the toxicities of abnormal protein aggregates and may contribute to pathogenesis of degenerative diseases. Therefore, maintenance of proteasome function can be a novel strategy to protect cells against abnormal protein-mediated toxicity. In the present study, we have demonstrated the tissue specific increase of the catalytic subunits of the proteasome in mice following oral administration of 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T, 0.5 mmol/kg), which functions as a cancer preventive agent in animal and human studies. Expression of the 20S catalytic core subunits PSMB5, PSMB6, and PSMB7 were increased in liver, lung, small intestine, and colon of mice at 24 h after D3T treatment. Elevated expression of proteasome catalytic subunits led to increases in proteasomal peptidase activities in these tissues. Oral administration of D3T also exerted a pharmacodynamic action in some brain regions of these mice and proteasomal peptidase activities were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex-hippocampus. Moreover, tissue extracts from D3T-treated mice and cell lysates obtained from D3T-incubated murine neuroblastoma cells exhibited the enhanced capacity to degrade mutant human SOD1G93A protein. These results indicate that the catalytic subunits of the 26S proteasome are inducible in multiple tissues of mouse including brain by exogenous chemical treatment. Increased proteasome expression by inducers may have a role in protection/attenuation of protein aggregate-mediated disorders.</str>

      <str>The assembly of individual proteasome subunits into catalytically active mammalian 20S proteasomes is not well understood. Using subunit-specific antibodies, we characterized both precursor and mature proteasome complexes. Antibodies to PSMA4 (C9) immunoprecipitated complexes composed of alpha, precursor beta and processed beta subunits. However, antibodies to PSMA3 (C8) and PSMB9 (LMP2) immunoprecipitated complexes made up of alpha and precursor beta but no processed beta subunits. These complexes possess short half-lives, are enzymatically inactive and their molecular weight is approximately 300 kDa. Radioactivity chases from these complexes into mature, long-lived approximately 700 kDa proteasomes. Therefore, these structures represent precursor proteasomes and are probably made up of two rings: one containing alpha subunits and the other, precursor beta subunits. The assembly of precursor proteasomes occurs in at least two stages, with precursor beta subunits PSMB2 (C7-I), PSMB3 (C10-II), PSMB7 (Z), PSMB9 (LMP2) and PSMB10 (LMP10) being incorporated before others [PSMB1 (C5), PSMB6 (delta), and PSMB8 (LMP7)]. Proteasome maturation (processing of the beta subunits and juxtaposition of the two beta rings) is accompanied by conformational changes in the (outer) alpha rings, and may be inefficient. Finally, interferon-gamma had no significant effect on the half-lives or total amounts of precursor or mature proteasomes.</str>

      <str>Interferon (IFN) gamma induces replacements of the proteasomal subunits X and Y by LMP7 and LMP2, respectively, resulting in an alteration of the proteolytic specificity. We found a third pair of proteasome subunits expressed reciprocally in response to IFN-gamma. Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding one subunit designated as Z, downregulated by IFN-gamma, showed that it is a novel proteasomal subunit with high homology to MECL1, which is markedly induced by IFN-gamma. Thus, IFN-gamma induces subunit replacements of not only X and Y by LMP7 and LMP2, respectively, but also of Z by MECL1, producing proteasomes responsible for immunological processing of endogenous antigens. When processed from their precursors, three pairs of the 10 homologous, but distinct, beta-type subunits of eukaryotic proteasomes, that is, X/LMP7, Y/LMP2, and Z/MECL1, have an NH2-terminal threonine residue, assumed to be part of a catalytic center. These findings suggest that the altered molecular organization of the proteasome induced by IFN-gamma may be responsible for acquisition of its functional change.</str>

      <str>Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard technique for mRNA quantification, but appropriate normalization is required to obtain reliable data. Normalization to accurately quantitated RNA has been proposed as the most reliable method for in vivo biopsies. However, this approach does not correct differences in RNA integrity.</str>
      <str>In this study, we evaluated the effect of RNA degradation on the quantification of the relative expression of nine genes (18S, ACTB, ATUB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT, POLR2L, PSMB6 and RPLP0) that cover a wide expression spectrum. Our results show that RNA degradation could introduce up to 100% error in gene expression measurements when RT-qPCR data were normalized to total RNA. To achieve greater resolution of small differences in transcript levels in degraded samples, we improved this normalization method by developing a corrective algorithm that compensates for the loss of RNA integrity. This approach allowed us to achieve higher accuracy, since the average error for quantitative measurements was reduced to 8%. Finally, we applied our normalization strategy to the quantification of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 in 104 rectal cancer biopsies. Taken together, our data show that normalization of gene expression measurements by taking into account also RNA degradation allows much more reliable sample comparison.</str>

      <str>Reanalyses of vertebrate PSMB5 and PSMB8 genes were conducted with a newly obtained amphioxus sequence. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the amphioxus sequence is an outgroup of both vertebrate PSMB5 and PSMB8 genes. The agnathan sequences were previously thought to be closer to PSMB5 than PSMB8 sequences. However, in this study the phylogenetic trees supported the clustering of agnathan sequences with PSMB8 rather than with PSMB5 sequences. In the alignment there are many sites in which the agnathan sequences are more similar to PSMB5 than PSMB8 sequences. Parsimony analysis showed that the amino acid pattern at these sites could be explained by one substitution on the ancestral branch leading to the jawed vertebrate PSMB8 cluster. The number of substitutions required at these sites was the same for different tree topologies with respect to the position of agnathans. The phylogenetic analyses of PSMB6/PSMB9 and PSMB7/PSMB10 genes indicated that all the interferon-gamma-inducible forms have evolved two to three times faster than the housekeeping forms in the jawed vertebrate lineage. Hence although the agnathan sequences cluster with the PSMB8 sequences, they have a slower rate of evolution similar to that of the housekeeping forms, and may be functioning as housekeeping forms.</str>

      <str>Treatment of melanoma cell lines with IFN-gamma induces the switch from proteasome (PS) to immunoproteasome (iPS). This finding has profound implications for the immunobiology of melanoma cells since certain peptides (such as Melan-A(mart1)(27-35)) are cleaved differently by iPS, thus implying a different ability to be presented by HLA class I molecules. IFN-alpha is a cytokine not only produced during infectious diseases, but also used in the treatment of certain cancers. Nevertheless, the effects of IFN-alpha on the switch of PS to iPS are largely unknown. A comparison of the effect of both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma was thus carried out on melanoma cell lines. RT-PCR showed that mRNA for iPS subunits (i.e. LMP-2, LMP-7 and MECL-1) was detectable both in untreated and IFN-treated melanoma cells. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that while IFN-gamma was able to consistently induce the switch from PS to iPS, IFN-alpha treatment did not, possibly due to post-transcriptional event(s) blocking the expression of iPS-specific subunits. Finally, Melan-A(mart1)(27-35) peptide was found only in the HPLC-MS spectra from both untreated and IFN-alpha-treated cells, but not upon IFN-gamma treatment. Altogether, these data demonstrate that IFN-alpha does not induce the switch from PS to iPS.</str>

To address this, we investigated the early-age-related (pediatric vs. adult) mechanisms that augment immunopathogenesis of sepsis and acute lung injury.</str>
      <str>The 3-weeks (pediatric) and 6-months (adult) old C57BL/6 mice were selected as the study groups. Mice were subjected to 1×20 cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mediated sepsis or intratracheal Psuedomonas aeruginosa (Pa)-LPS induced acute lung injury (ALI).We observed a significant increase in basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 and neutrophil activity marker, myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the adult mice compared to the pediatric indicating the age-related constitutive increase in inflammatory response. Next, we found that age-related decrease in PSMB6 (proteasomal subunit) expression in adult mice results in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). We identified that Pa-LPS induced activation of UPR modifier, p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein) in the adult mice lungs correlates with increase in Pa-LPS induced NFκB levels. Moreover, we observed a constitutive increase in p-eIF2α indicating a protective ER stress response to accumulation of ubiquitinated-proteins. We used MG-132 treatment of HBE cells as an in vitro model to standardize the efficacy of salubrinal (inhibitor of eIF2α de-phosphorylation) in controlling the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the NFκB levels. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of salubrinal to correct proteostasis-imbalance in the adult mice based on its ability to control CLP induced IL-6 secretion or recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells.</str>

      <str>Most antigenic peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are generated by proteasomes. Interferon-gamma, which stimulates antigen presentation, induces new proteasome beta-subunits LMP2 and LMP7, which replace the homologous beta-subunits Y (delta) and X (epsilon). As a result, the capacity of the proteasome to cleave model peptides increases after hydrophobic and basic residues and falls after acidic residues. To clarify the function of these subunits, we examined the effects of overexpressing subunits X (delta) and Y (epsilon). Transfection of the Y gene into HeLa cells stimulated the proteasomal cleavage after acidic residues without altering other peptidase activities. This effect was proportional to the amount of the Y subunits and opposite to the effect of its homolog, LMP2. Y appears to promote cleavages after acidic residues. Furthermore, in mutants lacking the LMP genes (in contrast to wild-type cells), interferon-gamma treatment increased the proteasome content of Y subunits and enhanced postacidic cleavages. Transfection with cDNA for the X subunit reduced hydrolysis after hydrophobic and basic residues, an effect opposite to transfection of LMP2 and LMP7. Surprisingly, transfection of X increased the amounts not only of X, but also of Y, while decreasing LMP2 content. Thus, the loss of the Y subunit upon interferon-gamma treatment or LMP2 transfection accounts for the suppression of postacidic cleavages, and the loss of X contributes to the increased hydrolysis after hydrophobic and basic residues. These adaptations should favor the production of the kinds of peptides that are presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.</str>

We describe a modified GSEA (improved derivation) to identify genes that are significantly and differentially expressed between disease and non-disease states and that are consistently co-expressed with a target pathway which is deeply related to disease etiology. The modified GSEA uses available gene expression data to identify molecular mechanism (ubiquitin-proteasome and inflammatory response) associated with the disease.

      <str>Exposure to [14C]-3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) of multicatalytic proteinase complexes (MPC) isolated from bovine pituitary and spleen leads to label incorporation into several beta-type subunits, to rapid inactivation of the chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) activity, and to a slower inactivation of other activities of the MPC. The pituitary and spleen MPCs differ in that the first contains almost exclusively the X, Y, and Z subunits, whereas in the latter these subunits are largely replaced by LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1. Preincubation with two peptidyl aledhyde inhibitors of the ChT-L activity protected the X subunit in the pituitary MPC and unexpectedly the LMP2 subunit in the spleen MPC from label incorporation, despite the greater amino acid sequence homology of the LMP7 subunit to that of the X subunit. Losses in the yield of amino acids in both subunits, shown by amino acid sequencing, and lability of the DCI-protein bond indicated formation of an acyl derivative by reaction of DCI with the threonine OH group. Brief exposure to [14C]-DCI led to preferential incorporation of label into the LMP2 and X subunits, consistent with the high inactivation rate constants of the ChT-L activity. Z-LLF-CHO, an inhibitor of ChT-L activity, but not Z-GPFL-CHO, an inhibitor of the branched chain amino acid preferring component, prevented incorporation of radioactivity into the X subunits, whereas both inhibitors prevented label incorporation into LMP2, indicating differences in susceptibility to inhibition between the two components. These and other data are consistent with involvement of the X and LMP2 subunits in expression of the ChT-L activity in the pituitary and spleen MPC, respectively, and suggest the catalytic functions of two other beta-subunits.</str>
